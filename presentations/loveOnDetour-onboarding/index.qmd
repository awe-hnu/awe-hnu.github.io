> Why did I end up back as a professor in academia (after all)?

# Theory {.vertical-center}

Job characteristics theory [@hackman1976motivation]

`Motivation Potential Score` =  
(`SkillVariety` * `TaskIdentity` * `TaskSignificance`)/3  
* `Autonomy` * `Feedback`

|     `SkillVariety` | strong**         |
|     `TaskIdentity` | rather strong*   |
| `TaskSignificance` | it depends**     |
|         `Autonomy` | partially*       | 
|         `Feedback` | often monetary** |

## Learnings

> The gras is **sometimes** greener on the other side

. . . 

However, for me 

:::{.incremental}
- significance and autonomy beats money,
- a job in academia gives the freedom to think things through,
- freedom comes with responsibilities (learn, share, change), but
- acting responsibly motivates.

. . .

Thus, academia was the place to return to.

## Conclusions

> Being at a university is a __great priviledge__

. . .

Thus, ... 

:::{.incremental}
- take the learning opportunities you get,
- don't learn just for making money once out,
- try to understand how the world really works, and
- embrace challenges and persist through obstacles.

The HNU is a lovely place to be (value that), I returned with pleasure.
