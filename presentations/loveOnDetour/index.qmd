## Learnings

> The gras is always greener on the other side

. . . 

However, for me 

:::{.incremental}
- significance and autonomy beats money,
- a job in academia gives the freedom to think things through,
- freedom comes with responsibilities (learn, share, change), and
- acting responsibly motivates.
::: 

. . .

Thus, academia was the place to return to.

## Conclusions

> Doing a PhD is a great learning journey

. . .

Thus, ... 

:::{.incremental}
- don't do it just for the money.
- Get feedback regularly (work on peer-reviewed articles early on),
- embrace challenges, persist through obstacles, and learn from criticism, and
- don't work on your own, build a network (research is teamwork).
- The HNU is a lovely place to be (value that).
- If your academia MPS is high, stay in touch with research and teaching.
