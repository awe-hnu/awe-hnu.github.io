# Theory {.vertical-center}

Job characteristics theroy [@hackman1976motivation]

`Motivation Potential Score` =  
(`SkillVariety` * `TaskIdentity` * `TaskSignificance`)/3  
* `Autonomy` * `Feedback`

## Learnings

> The gras is **sometimes** greener on the other side

. . . 

However, for me 

:::incremental
- significance and autonomy beats money,
- a job in academia gives the freedom to think things through,
- freedom comes with responsibilities (learn, share, change), but
- acting responsibly motivates.
::: 

. . .

Thus, academia was the place to return to.

## Conclusions

> Doing a PhD is a great __learning journey__

. . .

Thus, ... 

:::incremental
- don't do it just for the money.
- Get feedback regularly (work on peer-reviewed articles early on),
- embrace challenges, persist through obstacles, and learn from criticism, and
- don't work on your own, build a network (research is teamwork).
- The HNU is a lovely place to be (value that), I returned with pleasure.
- If your academia MPS is high, stay in touch with research and teaching.
