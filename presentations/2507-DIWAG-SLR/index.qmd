# Introduction {.headline-only}

## Why structured literature reviews (SLRs)?

> An effective review creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge. It facilitates theory development, closes areas where a plethora of research exists, and uncovers areas where research is needed. [@webster2002analyzing, p. xiii]

[SLRs]{.fragment} [help to deal with the complexity and volume of research, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [and support the generation of new insights, methods, or theories.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
:::

## Prime example in IS

@vial2021understanding reviewed 282 studies on digital transformation using a rigorous five-step methodology based on that of @wolfswinkel2013using

[Using a SLR, he]{.fragment}:

::: incremental
- synthesized fragmented research across multiple databases,
- developed the first comprehensive conceptial defintion of DT,
- inductively developed a novel theoretical framework on DT, 
- and proposed a research agenda.

## Goals of SLR

Four primary goals of literature reviews:

| Goal          | Description                              | Example from Vial (2019)                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Describe**      | [Map the field, categorize literature]{.fragment} | [Catalogue of 282 DT works across outlets]{.fragment} |
| **Understand**    | [Interpret phenomena and uncover patterns]{.fragment} | [Comprehensive definition and 8 building blocks]{.fragment} |
| **Explain**       | [Develop or extend theoretical understanding]{.fragment}              | [Novel process framework on DT *(main goal)*]{.fragment} |
| **Test**          | [Assess the aggregated evidence]{.fragment}       | [—]{.fragment} |

## Types of literature reviews

Distribution of goals and related review types in the top-tier IS journals from 2000 to 2014 according to @templier2018transparency:

| Goal | Review Type | Total | % |
|----------|-------------|-------|---|
| **Describe** | Narrative review | 25 | 18 |
|  | Descriptive review | 22 | 16 |
| **Understand** | Scoping review | 9 | 6 |
|  | Critical review | 16 | 11 |
| **Explain** | Theory development review | 52 | 37 |
| **Test** | Meta-analysis | 12 | 8 |
|  | Qualitative systematic review | 6 | 4 |

: Types of review articles in the top-tier IS journals (EJIS, ISJ, ISR, JAIS, JIT, JMIS, JSIS, and MISQ) [@templier2018transparency] {#tbl-tlr-is}

## Phases of an SLR

**Four-phase process:**

::: incremental
1. DESIGN — domain familiarization, identifying SLR need, prepare protocol
2. DISCOVER — systematic search & selection strategy  
3. DEVELOP – quality assessment, data extraction, synthesis
4. DISSEMINATE – transparent reporting and communication

**Key Principles:**  
Systematic + Transparent = Trustworthy

## Key differences accross phases

| Phase | Most structured | Moderately structured | Least structured |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| DESIGN | **Meta-analysis:** formal protocols; pre-registration; precise hypotheses | **Scoping & critical reviews:** comprehensive protocols, structured planning | **Narrative & theory development:** most 'flexible'/informal approach |
| DISCOVER | **Meta-analysis & scoping:** exhaustive search, multiple databases | **Critical & qualitative systematic:** systematic but targeted, multiple sources | **Theory development & narrative:** selective search, quality over quantity |
| DEVELOP | **Meta-analysis:**  rigorous quality assessment, statistical synthesis, standardized extraction | **Scoping & critical:** systematic analysis, quality screening, structured synthesis | **Theory development:** concept-based extraction, interpretive analysis |
| DISSEMINATE | **Meta-analysis:** PRISMA compliance, statistical reporting | **Scoping & qualitative systematic:** good methodology reporting, clear documentation | **Narrative & theory development:** focus on content over process |

# Focus #1: Inductive qualitative analysis {.headline-only}

## Qualitative synthesis to develop explanations

::: large
Goal: Moving beyond mere aggregation to theory building.
:::

[From collecting and categorizing findings (aggregation)]{.fragment}   
[to creating new theoretical insights from patterns (synthesis)]{.fragment}    
[by means of **structured inductive coding**]{.fragment}

## Structured inductive coding

Coding structure based on Gioia methodology [@gioia2013]

::: fragment
Start with [1st-order concepts]{.link-color} (data-driven)

- Direct evidence from literature
- Preserve original authors' terminology and findings
:::

::: fragment
Synthesize [2nd-order themes]{.link-color} (interpretation)  

- Refine into higher-order categories
- Identify theoretical concepts that explain patterns
:::

::: fragment
Create [aggregate dimensions]{.link-color} (higher-level constructs)

- Integrate relationships into framework
- Create overarching theoretical framework
:::

## Example: Vial (2019)

From raw data extracted from exsiting research to novel theoretical framework for DT

::: fragment
**Concept** (literature findings)

- "Digital technologies alter consumer behavior"
- "Platforms enable new business models" *...*
:::

::: fragment
**Themes** (analytical lense)

- "Use of digital technologies"
- "Disruptions"
- "Strategic responses" *...*
:::

::: fragment
**Dimensions and relationships**

Digital technologies *fuel* disruptions *trigger* strategic responses *rely on* digital technologies *enable* changes in value creation paths
:::

# Focus #2: GenAI in SLRs {.headline-only}

## Paradigm {.no-headline background-color="black"}

::: large
Instead of discussing what Gen.AI [can]{.link-color} and cannot do, we should to discuss what we [should allow]{.link-color} Gen.AI to do.

## GenAI use by SLR phase

| Phase | Key benefits | Key risks | Overall recommendation |
|-|---|---|----| 
| [DESIGN]{.fragment fragment-index=1} | [Enhanced comprehension, processing capabilities, alignment with standards]{.fragment fragment-index=1} | [Potential biases, over-reliance on existing narratives]{.fragment fragment-index=1} | [Use as starting point and for initial suggestions; maintain researcher control over core decisions]{.fragment fragment-index=1} |
| [DISCOVER]{.fragment fragment-index=2} | [Broadened scope, uncovered connections, enhanced comprehensiveness]{.fragment fragment-index=2} | [Biases affecting integrity and transparency, over-reliance on prevailing narratives]{.fragment fragment-index=2} | [Use supplementarily for initial discovery; always cross-reference and supplement with manual methods]{.fragment fragment-index=2} |
| [DEVELOP]{.fragment fragment-index=3} | [Streamlined analysis, pattern identification, enhanced efficiency]{.fragment fragment-index=3} | [Lack of transparency, biases might undermine reproducibility]{.fragment fragment-index=3} | [Use for initial analysis and pattern identification; verify manually and keep core synthesis researcher-led]{.fragment fragment-index=3} |
| [DISSEMINATE]{.fragment fragment-index=4} | [Improved clarity in writing, increased impact]{.fragment fragment-index=4} | [Undermining integrity & responsibility (misuse)]{.fragment fragment-index=4} | [Use only for refining language and clarity; avoid AI-generated content]{.fragment fragment-index=4} |

## Critical safeguards

::: fragment
**Tool-task fit:** match GenAI capabilities to specific SLR needs
:::

::: fragment
**Triangulation:** use multiple tools (similar to data source triangulation in traditional research)
:::

::: fragment
**Transparency:** document all GenAI usage (essential for reproducibility and methodological rigor)
:::

::: fragment
::: medium
There are no shortcuts
to making scientific contributions.
:::

However, you can leverage the capabilities of GenAI
while maintaining your human insight and scholarly rigor.

## Key Takeaways

::: incremental
- **SLRs are foundational** for systematic knowledge building
- **Inductive coding** provides structured approach to qualitative synthesis
- **Three-level structure** enables progression from data to theory
- **GenAI integration** should be **criteria-driven** and transparent
- **Human judgment** remains paramount for theoretical development
