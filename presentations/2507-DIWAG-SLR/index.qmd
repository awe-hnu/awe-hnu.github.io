# Introduction {.headline-only}

## Why structured literature reviews (SLRs)?

> An effective review creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge. It facilitates theory development, closes areas where a plethora of research exists, and uncovers areas where research is needed. [@webster2002analyzing, p. xiii].

- synthesized fragmented research across multiple databases,
- developed the first comprehensive conceptial defintion of DT,
- inductively developed a novel theoretical framework on DT, 
- and proposed a research agenda.

## Goals of SLR

Four primary goals of literature reviews:

| Goal          | Description                              | Example from Vial (2019)                   |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Describe**      | [Map the field, categorize literature]{.fragment} | [Catalogue of 282 DT works across outlets]{.fragment} |
| **Understand**    | [Interpret phenomena and uncover patterns]{.fragment} | [Comprehensive definition and 8 building blocks]{.fragment} |
| **Explain**       | [Develop or extend theoretical understanding]{.fragment}              | [Novel process framework on DT *(main goal)*]{.fragment} |
| **Test**          | [Assess the aggregated evidence]{.fragment}       | [—]{.fragment} |

## Types of literature reviews

Distribution of goals and related review types in the top-tier IS journals from 2000 to 2014 according to @templier2018transparency:

| Goal | Review Type | Total | % |
|----------|-------------|-------|---|
| **Describe** | Narrative review | 25 | 18 |
|  | Descriptive review | 22 | 16 |
| **Understand** | Scoping review | 9 | 6 |
|  | Critical review | 16 | 11 |
| **Explain** | Theory development review | 52 | 37 |
| **Test** | Meta-analysis | 12 | 8 |
|  | Qualitative systematic review | 6 | 4 |

: Types of review articles in the top-tier IS journals (EJIS, ISJ, ISR, JAIS, JIT, JMIS, JSIS, and MISQ) [@templier2018transparency] {#tbl-tlr-is}

:::notes
| Category | Review Type | Definition |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Describe** | Narrative review | Assemble and summarise extant literature to provide a comprehensive report on the current state of knowledge on a topic, often complemented by research gaps and/or research agenda |
|  | Descriptive review | Investigate mature topics to determine the extent to which empirical studies reveal interpretable patterns or trends over time, with more structured and transparent search and analysis methods than narrative reviews |
| **Understand** | Scoping review | Assess the size and scope of available literature on emergent topics to inform researchers about new areas for future research, usually concluding with a detailed research agenda |
|  | Critical review | Analyse extant literature to reveal contradictions, controversies, or inconsistencies, and may problematise an area by highlighting inconsistent theoretical assumptions |
| **Explain** | Theory development review | Provide new conceptualisations, models, theories, or frameworks with primary contribution lying in the novelty of proposed ideas, going beyond simply gathering and synthesising prior studies |
| **Test** | Meta-analysis | Use statistical techniques to summarise and synthesise prior empirical results, providing precise estimates of relations between variables by adjusting for sample size and reliability of measures |
|  | Qualitative systematic review | Use narrative methods to bring together quantitative findings from heterogeneous studies, following systematic and transparent processes |

## Phases of an SLR

**Four-phase process:**

:::incremental
1. **Design** – domain familiarization, identifying SLR need, prepare protocol
2. **Discover** – systematic search & selection strategy  
3. **Develop** – quality assessment, data extraction, synthesis
4. **Disseminate** – transparent reporting and communication

Systematic + Transparent = Trustworthy

## Key differences accross phases

| Phase | Most structured | Moderately structured | Least structured |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Design** | **Meta-analysis:** formal protocols; pre-registration; precise hypotheses | **Scoping & critical reviews:** comprehensive protocols, structured planning | **Narrative & theory development:** most 'flexible'/informal approach |
| **Discover** | **Meta-analysis & scoping:** exhaustive search, multiple databases | **Critical & qualitative systematic:** systematic but targeted, multiple sources | **Theory development & narrative:** selective search, quality over quantity |
| **Develop** | **Meta-analysis:**  rigorous quality assessment, statistical synthesis, standardized extraction | **Scoping & critical:** systematic analysis, quality screening, structured synthesis | **Theory development:** concept-based extraction, interpretive analysis |
| **Disseminate** | **Meta-analysis:** PRISMA compliance, statistical reporting | **Scoping & qualitative systematic:** good methodology reporting, clear documentation | **Narrative & theory development:** focus on content over process |

# Focus #1: Inductive qualitative analysis {.headline-only}

## Qualitative synthesis to develop explanations

:::large
Goal: Moving beyond mere aggregation to theory building.
:::

[From collecting and categorizing findings (**aggregation**)]{.fragment}   
[to creating new theoretical insights from patterns (**synthesis**)]{.fragment}    
[by means of **structured inductive coding**]{.fragment}

## Structured inductive coding

Coding structure based on Gioia methodology [@gioia2013]:

. . .

Start with [1st-order concepts]{.link-color} (data-driven)

- Direct evidence from literature
- Preserve original authors' terminology and findings

. . .

Synthesize [2nd-order themes]{.link-color} (interpretation)  

- Refine into higher-order categories
- Identify theoretical concepts that explain patterns

. . .

Create [aggregate dimensions]{.link-color} (higher-level constructs)

- Integrate relationships into framework
- Create overarching theoretical framework

## Example: Vial (2019)

From raw data extracted from exsiting research to novel theoretical framework for DT:

. . .

**Concept** (literature findings)

- "Digital technologies alter consumer behavior"
- "Platforms enable new business models" *...*

. . .

**Themes** (analytical lense)

- "Use of digital technologies"
- "Disruptions"
- "Strategic responses" *...*

. . .

**Dimensions and relationships**

Digital technologies *fuel* disruptions *trigger* strategic responses *rely on* digital technologies *enable* changes in value creation paths

# Focus #2: GenAI in SLRs {.headline-only}

## Paradigm {.no-headline background-color="black"}

:::large
Instead of discussing what Gen.AI [can]{.link-color} and cannot do, we should to discuss what we [should allow]{.link-color} Gen.AI to do.

@tingelhoff2024 [p. 78]

## GenAI use by SLR phase

| Phase | Key benefits | Key risks | Overall recommendation |
|-|---|---|----|
| **Design** | Enhanced comprehension, processing capabilities, alignment with standards | Potential biases, over-reliance on existing narratives | Use as starting point and for initial suggestions; maintain researcher control over core decisions |
| **Discover** | Broadened scope, uncovered connections, enhanced comprehensiveness | Biases affecting integrity and transparency, over-reliance on prevailing narratives | Use supplementarily for initial discovery; always cross-reference and supplement with manual methods |
| **Develop** | Streamlined analysis, pattern identification, enhanced efficiency | Lack of transparency, potential biases undermining reproducibility | Use for initial analysis and pattern identification; verify manually and keep core synthesis researcher-led |
| **Disseminate** | Improved clarity in writing, increased impact | Risk of abuse, undermining integrity & responsibility | Use only for refining language and clarity; avoid AI-generated content |

: Benefits, risks and recommendations based on @tingelhoff2024 {#tbl-recommendations}

## Critical safeguards

. . .

**Tool-task fit:** match GenAI capabilities to specific SLR needs

. . .

**Triangulation:** use multiple tools (similar to data source triangulation in traditional research)

. . .

**Transparency:** document all GenAI usage (essential for reproducibility and methodological rigor)

Conclusion: leveraging GenAI's capabilities while preserving essential human insight and scholarly rigor
