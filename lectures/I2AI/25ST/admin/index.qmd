# General remarks {.headline-only }

## Motivation and goals

**Articial Intelligence (AI)** is becoming a basic innovation that is developing into a driver of digitalisation and autonomous systems in all areas of life.

:::incremental
- AI will change life, work, the economy and communication in a similar way to the internet. 
- The release of openAI's chatGPT at the end of 2022 was a milestone in the history of AI. 
- Since then, most people have realised that AI will soon change the way we learn, work and live. 
- But large language models are only one type of AI. There are many other AI types, each with their own applications. 
:::

. . .

**This lecture will give you a clear understanding of different types of AI, what they do, and how they work.**

## Format of the lecture

This course will be taught using traditional synchronous lectures.

. . .

The focus of the classes is to [briefly]{.underline} introduce major concepts.

. . .

The greatest amount of work is in preparing for and following up lectures in order to become sufficiently familiar with and understand the concepts.

. . .

The exercises are the recommended preparation for the exam. [They must be completed independently at home]{.underline}, questions can be discussed in the lecture.

. . .

Please prepare your schedule accordingly.

# Contents

AI is defined here as **the study of agents** that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions.

. . .

In this course, we will 

:::{.incremental}

- cover different types of agents (i.e., goal-based and utility-based agents)
- illuminate some concepts and major functions they implement,
- discuss, how to convert these agents into learning agents,
- identify and discuss real life use cases for these agents, and
- have a look at philosophical stances and ethical implications of AI.

:::

# Learning objectives

During this course, you should advance your skills in the following areas:

::: {.incremental}
- Understanding of the origins, strengths and limitations of AI
- Basic knowledge of concepts, functions, and use cases of AI
- Basic knowledge of problem-solving algorithms, knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, and natural language processing
- Capability to apply your knowledge and understanding of AI to different managerial and organizational contexts
- Ability to assess the potential of AI and use it in digital innovations
- Ability to evaluate new information and to question existing assumptions
- Capacity to assess social and ethical implications of AI applications
:::

# Supporting literature

Besides the literature cited in the lecture notes, @RusselNorvig2022AIMA is the recommended accompanying reading for rereading and deepening the concepts

## Concluding remarks {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Why don't we focus on **ChatGPT** and the like only?
:::

. . .

Because I am convinced that as a **Master of Science** in Digital Innovation Management you should understand some of the **theoretical (mathematical) foundations** of AI.
However, you should also acquire practical skills on your own, e.g. in **interacting with GenAI**[^communicating].
