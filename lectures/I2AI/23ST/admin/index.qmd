## Concluding remarks {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Why don't we focus on **ChatGPT** and the like only?
:::

. . .

Because I am convinced that as a **Master of Science** in Digital Innovation Management you should understand some of the **theoretical (mathematical) foundations** of AI.
However, you should also acquire practical skills on your own, e.g. in [communicating with AI](https://learnprompting.org/).
