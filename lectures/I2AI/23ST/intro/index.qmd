# How is AI received? {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="images/bg.jpeg"}

## Sci-Fi

::: {.notes}
The perception of AI changed over the decades. This is well reflected in Sci-Fi Movies, e.g.

- R2D2 in Star Wars
- The Terminator
- Agent Smith in the Matrix
- Sonny in I,Robot
- Wall¬∑E
- etc.

## Reality

::: {.notes}
Will the fictions become reality? We will se. In any case, the intellectual frontiers of AI are wide open. The subfields span from artificial general intelligence (learning, reasoning, perception, etc.) to specific fields (e.g., translating, playing go) [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA].

>‚ÄúThe pace of progress in artificial intelligence is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast‚Äîit is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year timeframe. 10 years at most.‚Äù *Elon Musk*

# What is AI? {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="images/bg.jpeg"}

## Towards a definition of AI

AI is the science of making machines to 

::: {.incremental}
- __think__ *(though processes and reasoning)*
  - like people
  - rationally 
- and to __act__ *(behavior)*
  - like people 
  - rationally [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA]
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
## What is rational?
The term *rational* is used here in a very specific, technical way:

- Rational: maximally achieving pre-defined goals
- Rationality only concerns what decisions are made *(not the thought process behind them)*
- Goals are expressed in terms of the __utility__ of outcomes
- Being rational means *maximizing your expected utility*
:::
:::


## Acting humanly

#### The Turing Test approach

The __Turing Test__ [@Turing1950Com] tests if a computer has the ability to mimic peoples' behavior. To pass the test, it would need following capabilities:

::: {.incremental}
- natural language processing *(communicate)*
- knowledge representation *(store information)*
- automated reasoning *(answer questions, draw new conclusions)*
- machine learning *(adapt to new circumstances)*
:::

## Turing Test
The __Turing Test__ [@Turing1950Com] was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question "Can a machine think?" A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA].  
The __Total Turing Test__ additionally requires interaction with objects and people in the real world. This also requires computer vision and robotic capabilities.
:::
:::

## Thinking humanly

#### The cognitive modelling approach

__Cognitive science__ is the study of the human brain and its processes ‚Äî it examines how the human brain may be functioning. Cognitive science requires analytical observation and experimentation. We can learn about human thought in three ways [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA]:

::: {.incremental}
- introspection *(trying to catch our own thoughts)*
- experiments *(observing a person in action)*
- brain imaging *(observing the brain in action)*
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
## Differences between cognitive computing and AI
Cognitive science is about making computers solve complex problems similar to how humans solve problems. Cognitive computing tries to replicate how humans would solve problems, while AI is not bound to human cognitive processes.
:::
:::

## Thinking rationally

#### The laws of thought approach

The "laws of thought" refer to fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discorse itself is often considered to be based.

:::{.fragment}
>__Socrates is a man__ and __all men are mortal__, thus, it can be concluded that __Socrates is mortal__  *Aristotle (384-322 BCE)*
:::

:::{.fragment}
Computers have been able to solve *any* solvable problem, as long as 
:::

::: {.incremental}
- there are statements about *any* objects in the world,
- statements about the relations among them, and
- there is sufficient computing power available
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
### Logic, knowledge and probability

These laws of thought were supposed to govern the operation of the mind; the studies initiated the field called logic. However, human decisions are not always mathematically perfect or logical.  
Logic as conventionally understood requires knowledge of the world that is certain. As this condition is seldom achieved, the theory of probability fills this gap. Probability allows for rigorous reasoning with uncertain information. [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA]
:::
:::


## Acting rationally

#### The rational agent approach

An *agent* is something that acts, an *rational agent* is one that acts so as to achieve the best coutcome (i.e., does the right thing), or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome (i.e., does the appropriate thing) based on the objective that is provided to the agent [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA].

:::{.fragment}
The approach goes beyond the "laws of thought" approach as it involves actions based on
:::

::: {.incremental}
- inference (deducing that a given action is the best and then to act on this conclusion) __and__
- other mechanisms such as reflex (when speed is more successful than careful deliberation that takes some time)
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
### Standard model in AI

@RusselNorvig2022AIMA call the approach where the primary definition of success is getting better and better at achieving rigid human-specified goals the __standard model of AI research__. This standard model prevails not only in AI, "but also in control theory, where a controller minimizes a cost function; in operations research, where a policy maximizes a sum of rewards; in statistics, where a decision rule minimizes a loss function; and in economics, where a decision maker maximizes utility or some measure of social welfare" (p. 22).  
They also criticize the standard model because it is increasingly difficult to specify the goal completely and correctly (e.g., autonomous driving involves multiple goals such as reaching the goal safely, where a strict definition of safety requires staying in the garage because driving on the road has a risk of injury due to myriad factors; how should the trade-off between reaching the goal and taking a risk of injury be made? There are so many questions that are difficult to answer a priori). Mis-specified goals most likely do not reflect what human designers intend, e.g., by not taking into account human values that are not included in the goals.

# Any issues with that concept? {.unlisted .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="images/bg.jpeg"}

# Benificial machines

__Machines that are provably beneficial to humans__

According to @RusselNorvig2022AIMA two refinements to the standard model of AI are needed:

::: {.incremental}
- The ability of *any* agent to choose rational actions is constrained by the computational untractability of doing so
- An intelligent agent should not pursue a definite object, it should pursue objectives that *benefit humans*, while being uncertain as to what they are
:::

:::{.notes}
When a machine knows that it does not know the entire objective, it has an incentive to act cautiously, to ask permission, to learn more about our preferences through observation, and to submit to human control.

## A brief AI-timeline

`1943‚Äî1956` __The inception of AI__

- 1943: McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of brain *(artificial neurons with on and off states; all logical connectives can be implemented with some network of these)*
- 1950: Turing's ‚ÄúComputing Machinery and Intelligence‚Äù *(@Turing1950Com already introduced the Turing test, machine learning, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning)*
- 1950s: Early AI programs *(e.g., Arthur Samuel's influential checkers program that learned to play at a strong amateur level)*

## {.unlisted}

`1966‚Äî73` __A dose of reality__

- The early AI programs failed on more difficult problems
  - Focus on "informed introspection" as to how humans perform a task
  - Lack of appreciation of the intractability of many of the problems
- Signification reduction of government funding of AI research

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
 
`1970‚Äî90` __Expert systems__ (knowledge-based approaches)

- 1969‚Äî79: Early development of knowledge-based systems *(rule-based heuristic algorithms)*
- 1980‚Äî88: Expert systems industry booms *(nearly every major U.S. corporate had its own AI group)*
- Soon after that came the ‚ÄúAI winter‚Äù *(difficulties to build expert systems for complex domains due to uncertainty and a lack of learning)*

:::

## {.unlisted}

`1990‚Äîpresent` __AI spring:__ (statistical approaches)

- Focus on probabilistic reasoning (rather than Boolean logic) and machine learning
- Reunification of subfields such as computer vision, robotics, speech recognition, and natural language processing

## {.unlisted}

`2012‚Äîpresent` __New excitement__

- Advances in computing power, WWW, and very large data sets  
*(e.g., IBM Watson's victory in Jeopardy!)*

> Improvement in performance obtained from increasing the size of the data set by two or three orders of magnitude outweighs any improvement that can be obtained from tweaking the algorithm *@Banko-2001Scaling*

- Deep learning systems offer significant performance gains  
*(e.g., AlphaGo's victories)*
- Significant focus on AI in academia and industry
- AI systems find increasing application in the real world *(e.g., robotic vehicles, [machine translation](https://deepl.com), speech recognition, recommendations, [autonomous planning](https://maps.google.com), [game playing](https://play.aidungeon.io/), image understanding, medicine)*

# ‚úèÔ∏è Exercises {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="images/bg.jpeg"}

The exercises are (inspired) by @RusselNorvig2022AIMA

## I2AI_1 E1

Define in your own words:

- intelligence
- artificial intelligence
- agent
- rationality
- logical reasoning

## I2AI_1 E2¬†

Every year the Loebner Prize is awarded to the program that comes closest to passing a version of the Turing Test. 

Research and report on the latest winner of the Loebner prize. 

- What techniques does it use?
- How does it advance the state of the art in AI?

## I2AI_1 E3

To what extent are the following computer systems instances of artificial intelligence:

- Supermarket bar code scanners
- Web search engines
- Voice-activated telephone menus
- Internet routing algorithms that respond dynamically to the state of the network

## I2AI_1 E4

Various subfields of AI have held contests by defining a standard task and inviting researchers to do their best. Examples include the DARPA Grand Challenge for robotic cars, the International Planning Competition, the Robocup robotic soccer league, the TREC information retrieval event, and contests in machine translation and speech recognition. 

Investigate one of these contests and describe the progress made over the years. 

- To what degree have the contests advanced the state of the art in AI? 
- To what degree do they hurt the field by drawing energy away from new ideas?

## I2AI_1 E5

Read the statements (one after the other) and discuss if the second sentence of each statement is true and if it does imply the first.

> Surely computers cannot be intelligent  
‚Äîthey can do only what their programmers tell them.

> Surely animals cannot be intelligent  
‚Äîthey can do only what their genes tell them.

> Surely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent  
‚Äîthey can do only what their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physics.
