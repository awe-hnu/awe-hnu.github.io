Fairspeech â€” Race Gap in Speech Recognition Technology


## Tasks

Have a look at the [fairspeech website](https://fairspeech.stanford.edu/) (and at the [research paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1915768117)).

. . .

Think about the following questions and prepare answers.

:::{.incremental}
- What is the issue with current __automated speech recognition (ASR) systems __?
- Which ethical issues do they cause?
- What should be done to mitigate the risks?

# Case Study {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpeg"}

Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data

## Tasks

Revisit the case study and work on following questions.

:::{.incremental}
- How do the problems described in the case study relate to what you have learned in this course about AI and how it works?
- Are there statements in the paper that you disagree with and/or that are counterintuitive in light of current developments?
- Regarding the AI services you use, where do you see the conditions of a informed consent as outlined in the case study fulfilled?
- What are explainable models and why are  they important from an ethical perspective?
- What are problems concerning explainable models and deep neural networks?
- Do you think we need more regulations to address AI and its impacts in the same way that we already do with climate change and biotechnology?

Learn about government and private sector-driven approaches to moving toward responsible AI

## Group 1

Research about the __Proposal for a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence__ of the European Union (the "AI act").

. . .

Try to understand the purpose and content of the act.

. . .

Particularly, give answers to following questions:

:::{.incremental}
- What are general types of requirements on AI?
- What are high risk AI systems?
- Which requirements sould be mandatory requirements for these?
- Are government regulation as proposed here appropriate? 
:::

## Group 2

Research about __Microsoft Responsible AI Standard__ (v2)

. . . 

Try to understand the purpose of this standard.

. . .

Particularly, give answers to following questions:

:::{.incremental}
- What are goals Microsoft want to achieve?
- What are the principles described by the standard?
- How does Microsoft propose to assess the impact of AI?
- How does the standard affect Microsofts own operations and services?
:::

## Group 3

Research about __Googles Viewpoint on AI__

. . . 

Try to understand Google's approach to develop artificial intelligence responsibly in order to benefit people and society.

. . .

Particularly, give answers to following questions:

:::{.incremental}
- What are google's principels to responsible AI?
- What kind of AI applications does Google not develop on principle? Are the statements credible?
- Which practices do they recommend when developing AI?
- How do Google's principal and practices affect their organization and operations?
:::

## Summary

What are similarities and differences of these approaches to responsible AI?

Which principles and practices would you make yours?
