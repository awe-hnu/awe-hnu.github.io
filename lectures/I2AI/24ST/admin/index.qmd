# General remarks

This course will be taught using a blended learning approach. 

. . .

You need to prepare the content of the individual lectures independently by using the lecture notes and the reading material provided (e.g. references).

. . .

The focus of the lessons is on answering your questions, discussing application domains and the exercises.

. . .

**Please reserve enough time to prepare, reflect, and deepen the contents on your own.**

# Contents

AI is defined here as **the study of agents** that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions.

. . .

In this course, we will 

:::{.incremental}

- cover different types of agents (i.e., goal-based and utility-based agents)
- illuminate some concepts and major functions they implement,
- discuss, how to convert these agents into learning agents,
- identify and discuss real life use cases for these agents, and
- have a look at philosophical stances and ethical implications of AI.

:::

# Learning objectives

During this course, you should advance your skills in the following areas:

::: {.incremental}
- Understanding of the origins, strengths and limitations of AI
- Basic knowledge of concepts, functions, and use cases of AI
- Basic knowledge of problem-solving algorithms, knowledge representation, probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, and natural language processing
- Capability to apply your knowledge and understanding of AI to different managerial and organizational contexts
- Ability to assess the potential of AI and use it in digital innovations
- Ability to evaluate new information and to question existing assumptions
- Capacity to assess social and ethical implications of AI applications

## Concluding remarks {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Why don't we focus on **ChatGPT** and the like only?
:::

. . .

Because I am convinced that as a **Master of Science** in Digital Innovation Management you should understand some of the **theoretical (mathematical) foundations** of AI.
However, you should also acquire practical skills on your own, e.g. in **interacting with GenAI**[^communicating].
