## Search limitations

The problem-solving agents based on __search algorithms__ know things, but only in a very limited, inflexible sense [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA, p. 226]:

:::{.incremental}
- They know what actions are available (`ACTIONS(s)`) and what the result of performing a specific action from a speicifc state will be (`RESULT(s,a`). But they __don't know general facts__.
- Using __atomic represtations__, representing knowledge about the environment (i.e., the state space) requires to list all possible concrete states
- The goal can formally only be described as an __explicit set of states__
:::

## Think rationally

Until now, the focus has been on agents that act rationally. Often, however, rational action requires __rational (logical) thought__ on the agent‚Äôs part. 

. . .

To this end, relevant aspects of the environment must be represented in a __knowledge base__ (KB), composed of __sentences__ in knowledge reprensentation language (e.g., logic)

:::{.incremental}
- Each sentences represents some assertion about the world (__semantics__)
- The sentences themselves have a causal influence on the agent‚Äôs behaviour in a way that is correlated with the contents of the sentences (__syntax__)
- Interaction with the KB through `ASK` and `TELL` operations (simplified)
  - `ASK`: asks the KB what action it should perform
  - `TELL`: tells the knowledge base what it perceives

### Types of sentences

- __Axioms__: a sentence is taken as being given without being derived from other sentences
- __Inference__: a sentence is derived from old sentence 
:::

### Levels of knowledge representation

Three levels of knowledge representation can be distinguished [@newell1982knowledge]:

- The __knowledge level__ concerns the total knowledge contained in the KB at the most abstract level; e.g., the Deutsche Bahn information 
system knows that a trip from Ulm to Stuttgart costs EUR 25.
- At the __logical level__ knowledge is encoded in a formal language; e.g., `price(Ulm, Stuttgart, 25.00)`
- At the __implementation level__ the knowledge is represented as sentences; e.g.,
  - as a string ‚ÄúPrice(Freiburg, Basel, 18.00)‚Äù
  - as a value in a matrix
:::

## Knowledge-based agents

A knowledge-based agent uses its knowledge base to

:::{.incremental}
- represent its background knowledge,
- store its observations (i.e., percepts),
- derive actions, and 
- store its executed actions.

# The Wumpus World {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpeg"}

## Introduction

The __wumpus world__ is an environment in which knowledge-based agents can show their worth.

- A cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways
- Wumpus is in one room. It eats anyone who enters its room
- The wumpus can be shut by an agent, but the agent only has one arrow
- Some rooms contain bottomless pits
- The goal is to survive, to find a heap of gold and to leave the cave

## PEAS

### Performance measure

- +1,000 for finding the gold
- -1,000 for dying (falling into a pit or being eaten by the wumpus)
- -1 for each action taken
- -10 for using the arrow
- The game ends either when the agents dies or finds the gold

---

### Environment

- 4 x 4 grid with walls surrounding the grid
- The agent alsoways starts in *[1,1]*
- The locations of gold and wumpus are chosen randomly (other than *[1,1]*)
- Each square other than *[1,1]* can be a pit, with probability .2
- There is a ladder to leave the cave in square *[1,1]* 

----

### Actuators

- Move (*Go forward*, *turn right by 90¬∞*, *turn left by 90¬∞*)
- *Grab* (pick up an object in the same square)
- *Shoot* (there is only one arrow)
- *Leave* the cave (only works in square [1,1]).

----

### Sensors

- The agent cannot perceive its own location
- In the square containing the wumpus and in the directly adjacent squares, the agent perceives a *stench*
- In the squares adjacent to a pit, the agent perceives a *breeze*
- In the square where the gold is, the agent perceives a *glitter*
- When the agent walks into a wall, it perceives a *bump*
- When the wumpus is killed, its *scream* is heard everywhere

Percepts are represented as a 5-tuple, e.g.,
`[Stench, Breeze, Glitter, None, None]`

:::{.notes}
`[Stench, Breeze, Glitter, None, None]` means that it stinks, there is a breeze and a glitter, but no bump and no scream.

The PEAS can be characterized as *deterministic, discrete, static, and single-agent*

A typical wumpos world

- The agent is in the bottom left corner `[1,1]`, facing east (rightward)
- There are three pits in the world (`[4,4]`,`[3,3]`, and `[3,1]`)
- Wumpus is in room `[1,3]`
- The gold is in room `[2,3]`
