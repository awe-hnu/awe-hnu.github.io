## Sci-Fi

::: {.notes}
The perception of AI changed over the decades. This is well reflected in Sci-Fi Movies, e.g.

- R2D2 in Star Wars
- The Terminator
- Agent Smith in the Matrix
- Sonny in I,Robot
- Wall·E
- etc.

## Reality

::: {.notes}
Will the fictions become reality? We will se. In any case, the intellectual frontiers of AI are wide open. The subfields span from artificial general intelligence (learning, reasoning, perception, etc.) to specific fields (e.g., translating, playing go) [@Russel-Norvig-2022].

>“The pace of progress in artificial intelligence is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year timeframe. 10 years at most.” *—Elon Musk*

## Towards a definition of AI

AI is the science of making machines to 

::: {.incremental}
- __think__ *(though processes and reasoning)*
  - like people
  - rationally 
- and to __act__ *(behavior)*
  - like people 
  - rationally [@Russel-Norvig-2022]
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
## What is rational?
The term *rational* is used here in a very specific, technical way:

- Rational: maximally achieving pre-defined goals
- Rationality only concerns what decisions are made *(not the thought process behind them)*
- Goals are expressed in terms of the __utility__ of outcomes
- Being rational means *maximizing your expected utility*
:::
:::


## Acting humanly

#### The Turing Test approach

The __Turing Test__ [@Turing-1950] tests if a computer has the ability to mimic peoples' behavior. To pass the test, it would need following capabilities:

::: {.incremental}
- natural language processing *(communicate)*
- knowledge representation *(store information)*
- automated reasoning *(answer questions, draw new conclusions)*
- machine learning *(adapt to new circumstances)*

## Turing Test
The __Turing Test__ [@Turing-1950] was designed as a tought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question "Can a machine think?" A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell wether the written responses come from a person or from a computer [@Russel-Norvig-2022].  
The __Total Turing Test__ additionally requires interaction with objects and people in the real world. This also requires computer vision and robotic capabilities.

## Thinking humanly

#### The cognitive modelling approach

__Cognitive science__ is the study of the human brain and its processes — it examines how the human brain may be functioning. Cognitive science requires analytical observation and experimentation. We can learn about human thought in three ways [@Russel-Norvig-2022]:

::: {.incremental}
- introspection *(trying to catch our own thoughts)*
- experiments *(observing a person in action)*
- brain imaging *(observing the brain in action)*
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
## Differences between cognitive computing and AI
Cognitive science is about making computers solve complex problems similar to how humans solve problems. Cognitive computing tries to replicate how humans would solve problems, while AI is not bound to human cognitive processes.
:::
:::

## Thinking rationally

#### The laws of thought approach

The "laws of thought" refer to fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discorse itself is often considered to be based.

:::{.fragment}
>*Socrates is a man* and *all men are mortal*,
thus, it can be concluded that *Socrates is mortal*   
*-Aristotle*
:::

:::{.fragment}
In principle, computers have been able to solve *any* solvable problem (i.e., make correct inferences), as long as 
:::

::: {.incremental}
- there are statements about *any* objects in the world,
- statements about the relations among them, and
- there is sufficient computing power available
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
### Logic, knowledge and probability

These laws of thought were supposed to govern the operation of the mind; the studies initiated the field called logic. However, human decisions are not always mathematically perfect or logical.  
Logic as conventionally understood requires knowledge of the world that is certain. As this condition is seldom achieved, the theory of probability fills this gap. Probability allows for rigorous reasoning with uncertain information. [@Russel-Norvig-2022]
:::
:::


## Acting rationally

#### The rational agent approach

An *agent* is something that acts, an *rational agent* is one that acts so as to achieve the best coutcome (i.e., does the right thing), or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome (i.e., does the appropriate thing). 

:::{.fragment}
What counts as the best thing is defined by the objective that we provide to the agent [@Russel-Norvig-2022].
:::

:::{.fragment}
The approach goes beyond the "laws of thought" approach as it involves actions based on
:::

::: {.incremental}
- inference (deducing that a given action is the best and then to act on this conclusion) __and__
- on other mechanisms such as reflex (when speed is more sucessful than careful deliberation that takes some time)
:::

::: {.notes}
::: {.callout-note}
### Standard model in AI

@Russel-Norvig-2022 call the approach where the primary definition of success is getting better and better at achieving rigid human-specified goals the __standard model of AI research__. This standard model prevails not only in AI, "but also in control theory, where a controller minimizes a cost funciton; in operations research, where a policy maximizes a sum of rewards; in statistics, where a decision rule minimizes a loss funciton; and in economics, where a decision maker maximizes utility or some measure of social welfare" (p. 22).  
They also criticize the standard model because it is increasingly difficult to specify the goal completely and correctly (e.g., autonomous driving involves multiple goals such as reaching the goal safely, where a strict definition of safety requires staying in the garage because driving on the road has a risk of injury due to myriad factors; how should the trade-off between reaching the goal and taking a risk of injury be made? There are so many questions that are difficult to answer a priori). Mis-specified goals most likely do not reflect what human designers intend, e.g., by not taking into account human values that are not included in the goals.

## Benificial machines

#### Machines that are provably beneficial to humans

According to @Russel-Norvig-2022 Two refinements to the standard model of AI are needed:

::: {.incremental}
- The ability of *any* agent to choose rational actions is constrained by the computational untractability of doing so
- An intelligent agent should not pursue a definite object, it should pursue objectives that *benefit humans*, while being uncertain as to what they are
:::

:::{.notes}
When a machine knows that it does not know the entire objective, it has an incentive to act cautiously, to ask permission, to learn more about our preferences through observation, and to submit to human control.
