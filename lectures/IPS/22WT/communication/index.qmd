# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

> Challenging other and encouraging them to challenge you helps build trusting relationships because it shows 1) you care enough to point out both the things that aren’t going well and those that are and that 2) you are willing to admit when you’re wrong and that you are committed to fixing mistakes that you or others have made. *@scott2019radical*

# Introduction {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

## Let's discuss {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

Who are the best leaders you have worked for in your career? 
What made them so exceptional? What can you learn?

. . .

Tell a story about the worst boss you ever had. What did they do that 
made them so bad? How can you avoid those mistakes?

# Feedback {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}


# Challenges

You want to learn how to give (and receive) more helpful feedback? Here are three challenges that might help you along the way.

:::{.incremental}
- **Level 1:** Start a *feedback diary*. Note situations where you had to give someone praise or criticism. Write down what you said. Analyse if your feedback was radically candid. Try to reframe your non-radically candid praise or criticism so that it's more sincere and specific.
- **Level 2:** *Give feedback*, multiple times. Practice radical candor by applying the framework and the practices outlined in the [workbook](assets/radical-candor_workbook.pdf). Reflect on how the techniques have improved your conversations and realtionships.
- **Level 3:** *Spread the word*. Teach your team at work, a group of friends or your family about the radical candor framework (e.g., using the [one-pager](assets/radical-candor-one-pager.pdf) and the [workbook](assets/radical-candor_workbook.pdf). Introduce [*Whoops-a-Daisy & the Killer Whale*](assets/whoops-a-daisy-and-killer-whale.pdf) and practice it at least once a week over the upcoming weeks (remember the [CORE-model](assets/core-model.pdf). Reflect on how the feedback culture has changed.
