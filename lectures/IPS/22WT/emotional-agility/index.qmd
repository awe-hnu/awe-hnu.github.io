> How we deal with our inner worlds does drive everything. *Susan David, Psychologist*

:::{.notes}

In our modern societies, we attribute a lot to externalities. Often we think that we can change anything by changing externalities (e.g., changing our look to become more self-confident). And the external world does matter. Just think of what we discussed during the last lectures (e.g., "shaping the path"). But ultimately, the way we navigate our inner world, our ability to be healthy with ourselves, with our emotions, to be  connected with our values and who we want to be, this has an outsize impact on everything else.

This class is about *emotional agility*, the ability to come to your inner world—your thoughts, emotions, experiences and self-stories—with
courage, compassion and curiosity. We try to find answers to the questions why and how we should learn from them, evaluate the situations we face, be clear-sighted about your options and move forward with values and purpose.

# Introduction {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

## Let's discuss {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

We all perceive different kinds of emotions in our everyday life.   
Which of these are **good**, which of these are **bad**?

## Bad or good emotions?

According to @david2016emotional, there is a core narrative about emotions[^coreNarrative]:   
There are *good emotions* (e.g., joy, happiness) and *bad emotions* (e.g., grief, anger)

[^coreNarrative]: The labels *god* and *bad* are, e.g., also used in most of the academic articles about emotions.

. . .

However, we often experience that **beauty and fragility hold hands with one another** ("the truth of living"[^truthOfLiving]).

[^truthOfLiving]: When you love someone, your also open up yourself to having your heart broken—life demands that you can experience some of the so-called *bad thoughts* and *bad emotions*.

. . .

Research shows that struggling to determine whether a thought or feeling is good or bad can [@david2016emotional] ...

:::{.incremental}
- take up huge amounts of mental energy,
- lead the thought or emotion to hang around for longer,
- decrease our ability to solve problems,
- negatively impact our relationships, and,
- lead to lower levels of well-being over time.
:::

## Bothness

We can label thoughts and emotions as good and bad, treat them as facts (e.g., "I am sad"), or allow them to become our identity.

. . .

We can also treat them differently and create space for other aspects of ourselves to come forward. We can embrace *both*ness, reflecting the complex, contradictory, real.

. . .

> Bothness is the idea that you can do something even if you are scared to do it. It’s the idea that you can feel angry with your partner, notice that anger with compassion, and still reach out and give them a hug, because you recognize how much you value the relationship. There is wisdom in bothness. We can be afraid and still engage with a challenge. We can grieve and still laugh at a joke. Bothness gives us access to the full spectrum of life. Too often, we think that the world is a series of either/or decisions. Be bold. Choose both. *Susan David, Psychologist*

## {.html-hidden .unlisted background-image="images/pipe.png"}

:::{.notes}
The image is not the thing, the map is not the territory.

Categories, snap impressions, gut feelings are good as they prevent "decision paralysis". 

However, when they dominate the way we process information and behave, we lack agility and do not pay attention to the world as it is.

## Growth and freedom {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

> Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and freedom. *frankl1985man*

## Emotional agility

![Emotional rigidity vs. emotional agility](images/agility.svg){#fig-agility}

:::{.notes}

> People frequently die in fires or crash landings because they try to escape through the same door they used when they entered. *@david2016emotional*


If you’re ‘emotionally rigid’, you’re blind to new experiences and possibilities. You'll find yourself stuck on the same path, even though it has made you unhappy for years. Picture a Naval officer demanding a lighthouse change course without realizing it wasn’t a ship [*@david2016emotional, p. 1]. The belief was that his vessel had right of way but such rigid thinking could have led to catastrophe! Adopting agility in your emotions is more likely to steer you on the right path and allow you to be flexible when you need to be.

Emotional agility is needed as the world is constantly changing and, thus, always presenting us with new opportunities and situations to which conditions or pre-programmed cognitive and emotional responses are not helpful. We should, thus, always embrace a **beginners mind**.
:::

## Hooked

Getting hooked means that we let our actions be guided by our thoughts, feelings, and stories, rather than of what is really important to us.

. . .

A ‘hook’ is a thought or emotion that draws us in and keeps us preoccupied. These hooks are often extremely counter-productive.

. . .

The four most common hooks:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Thought blaming:** “I thought I’d embarrass myself, so I didn’t go.”
2. **Monkey mindedness:** Dwelling at length on a situation and ‘awfulising’ the circumstances.
3. **Old, outgrown ideas:** Believing that you must always act in ways that you have in the past, even when the circumstances might prove otherwise.
4. **Wrongheaded righteousness:** The need to be ‘right’ at all costs.
:::

:::{.notes}
Key signs that you're hooked are when you

- try to avoid having particular thoughts or rationalize them away (e.g. "I'm unhappy in my job... but at least I've got a job!");
- always try to 'think positive' or be happy;
- ignore troubling emotions (like sadness);
- blame your thoughts for having 'made you' do something e.g. 'I yelled at him because It thought he was undermining me,' or 'I1 didn't put my hand up for the project because I thought I might fail.';
- over analyze specific experiences (e.g. a past disappointment); or
- fight against the reality of the world and your life 'as it is'.
:::

## Getting unhooked

![David's [-@david2016emotional] framework for increasing emotional agility](images/unhook.svg){#fig-unhook}

:::{.notes}
### Show up

The first step is acknowledging emotions and stresses as they occur – not to dwell on them, but to learn. What am I feeling right now? What does this say about my values? An emotionally agile person is able to recognize their feelings with self-compassion and understanding.

Being more self-compassionate includes:

- letting go of self-criticism and expectations of perfection (within yourself, your work, your life at home);
- recognizing that comparing yourself with others is, almost always, a losing game;
- understanding that self-compassion does not make you weak or lazy. In fact, research shows the opposite - that self-compassion sharpens your edge;
- appreciating that self-compassion is not about lying to yourself. People who are self-compassionate are more likely to face into the truth about themselves and their weaknesses, than those who lack self-compassion.

### Stepping out

Stepping out means facing and labeling the problem. You need to take an objective view and assess your emotions. This can help you filter feelings that may not be entirely appropriate and to find ways to deal with what you are feeling. 

When you step out objectively, you are in control of your feelings and not the other way around.

Skills you can cultivate:

- The ability for you, *the thinker*, rather than the thought to be in charge, and for you, *the person*, rather than your
emotions to be in charge. In other words, developing the skill that allows you to be centered, reflective and intentional
in your reactions to events around you.
- Developing a 'meta view' or the ability to still feel your feelings and think your thoughts but to 'helicopter' above these
in order to make effective decisions.
- The ability to recognize when you are holding on to specific positions and ideas in ways that may not serve your life, and to let go of these.

### Walking your why

‘Walking your why’ means discovering what is important to you and acting accordingly. When you walk your why, you live by your personal values as closely as you possibly can. Living by your values will help to make your life more meaningful and satisfying. 

While it is not always possible to work or live the exact life you wish, there is usually a way to make your life or job fit better within your values.

When we move towards our values and are able to make choices that align us with who we want to be, that is incredibly empowering, and provides a new found sense of autonomy in difficult situations.

To make a difference in this area it may help you to:

- **Watch the gaps:** Simply noticing the gaps between your values and your behaviors in specific domains (at work, home, in your relationships or as they relate to your health and wellbeing) can help you to close them. 
- **Think first:** "is my response in line with my values of Accountability, Straightforwardness and Challenge?" 
- Remember that values are not abstract and intangible ideas. Rather they are qualities of action that you can bring to every day choices. 

### Move on

Once you’ve unpacked what you’re feeling, why you’re feeling that way, and aligned your next steps with who you want to be in the situation, it’s time to move on and take action.

**Emotionally agile individuals handle situations as they come up, feel them fully, make a plan, and don’t delay.**

This requires some critical areas of focus:

1. **A change mindset:** developing the belief that positive change is actually possible. Research shows that subtle differences in our beliefs about change can have a long-term impact across many different areas of our lives.
2. **Effective motivations:** trying to make a change based on a h' ave-to' motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a sense of obligation to your doctor, spouse, or due to shame) is less likely to be effective than a change based on a 'want-to' motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a genuine, internal desire to be healthier.) The type of motivation we have is critically important in determining whether a change will be successful.
3. **Habit tweaks:** understanding how to master the physics of successful habit change.
4. **Moving to discomfort:** making the choice to push oneself towards the edge of one's comfort zone as one tries to
develop skills and cultivate relationships.

## Closing remark {.html-hidden .unlisted .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

> 'Who’s in charge—the thinker or the thought?' Are we managing our own lives according to our own values and what is important to us, or are we simply being carried along by the tide? *@david2016emotional*


# Challenges

You want to learn how to lead change more efficiently? Here are three challenges that might help you along the way.

:::{.incremental}
- **Level 1:** *Reflect through writing.* During next next two weeks, take 10 minutes at the end of each day to write about your emotional experiences from the past day; don't worry about making it perfect or readable: go where your mind takes you; it's not about the document (you can delete it); the point is that those thoughts are now out of you and on the page.
- **Level 2:** *Watch the gaps.* Identify the values (i.e., qualities of action), that are important to you[^values]; analyze your behaviors in challenging situations and watch the gaps between them and your values (i.e., is my response in line with my values of ...)—often simply noticing gaps can help to close them
- **Level 3:** *Getting unhooked.* extend *watch the gaps* and recognize your patterns, notice if you’ve been hooked by your thoughts and feelings; if so, label them, accept them, and then act on your values (i.e., take deliberate action that aligns with your values; do not revert to the familiar, but take and enjoy the challenge, without being overwhelmed)
