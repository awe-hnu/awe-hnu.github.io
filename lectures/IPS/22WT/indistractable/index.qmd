# Introduction {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

> Being indistractable means striving to do what you say you will do. Indistractable people are as honest with themselves as they are with others. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 15]*

## Problem statement

The world is and has always been full of things to distract us.

. . .

#### The contradiction of our age

:::{.incremental}
- The world today can be more distracting then ever (data, ubiquitous technology and unlimited access to content, ...)
- The most sought-after jobs are those that require creative problem-solving, novel solutions and the kind of human ingenuity that comes from **focusing deeply on the task at hand**.
:::
. . .

**Problem:** Instead of keeping focus on the things we say we will do (i.e., the important things), we often inclined to reach for things we supposedly need but really don't [@eyal2019indistractable].

## Traction and distraction

![Traction and distraction [@eyal2019indistractable, p. 13]](images/distraction-action.svg)

:::{.notes}
**Traction** comes from the Latin *trahere* and means to pull or drag. Traction lead you closer to your goals. It is any action that moves you towards what you really want.    
**Distraction** is the opposite of traction and means 'pulling the mind away.' Distractions stops us from achieving our gols. It is any action that moves you away from what you really want.
:::

## Reflect! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/exercise.jpg"}

Write down one thing you did today that ...

- moved you closer to what you really wanted    
    and the benefit you received from that action; and
- moved you away from what you really wanted    
    and the foregone benefit of taking that action.

## How to closer to living life I want? {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg"}

## The indistractable model

![The Indistractable Model [@eyal2019indistractable, p. 17]](images/model.svg)

:::{.notes}
We can be indistractable by learning and adopting four key strategies: mastering internal triggers, hacking back external triggers, making time for traction, and preventing distraction with pacts.
:::


# Internal triggers {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/internal.jpg"}

> Even when we think we're seeking pleasure, we're actually driven by the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 15]*

## What motivates us

**We are motivated by pleasure.**

. . .

But what is pleasure? Pleasure means 'not profligate pleasures, but absence of bodily pain and mental tarachai or troubles' [Greek philosopher Epicurus according to @annas1987epicurus, p. 3]

. . .

**All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort.** 
If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we’re likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort.

. . .

**What prevents discomfort can be addictive, but that doesn't make it irresistible.** 
If you know the drivers of your behavior, you can take steps to manage them.

## Reflect! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/exercise.jpg"}

Name four things you tend to get distracted while doing. Describe what you did to distract yourself.

Write down three root causes of discomfort you may be trying to escape by doing the unwanted behavior. 

:::{.notes}
For example, when I was using my phone when I wanted to spend quality time with my daughter, I was trying to escape: 1) the fear that I might be missing out on something important happening at work, 2) the anticipation of a client email, and 3) the boredom that comes from playing with a young child for too long.
:::

## Pain management

**Gearing towards traction is pain management.**
Distractions cost us time, and like all actions, they are spurred by the desire to escape discomfort.

. . .

**Four psychological factors make satisfaction temporary.**
Our tendencies toward *boredom*, *negativity bias*, *rumination*, and *hedonic adaptation* conspire to make sure we’re never satisfied for long.

. . .

:::{.notes}
- **Boredom:** It's shocking how far people will go to avoid boredom. For instance, @wilson2014just found that participants typically did not enjoy spending 6 to 15 minutes in a room by themselves with nothing to do but think, that they enjoyed doing mundane external activities much more, and that many preferred to administer electric shocks to themselves instead of being left alone with their thoughts. **Most people seem to prefer to be doing something rather than nothing, even if that something is negative.**
- **Negativity bias** is a phenomenon in which negative events are more salient and demand attention more powerfully than neutral or positive events" [@chai2016negativity, p.2]. There is ample empirical evidence that adults display a negativity bias, or the propensity to attend to, learn from, and use negative information far more than positive information [@vaish2008not]. Such pessimism seems to begin very early in life. @vaish2008not show that even babies as young as seven months show signs of negative bias. **In a nutshell: bad ist stronger than good.**
- **Rumination** includes reflection and brooding.  Reflection refers to 'a purposeful turning inward to engage in cognitive problem solving', while brooding reflects 'a passive comparison of one’s current situation with some unachieved standard' [@treynor2003rumination, p. 256]. Put it simple, rumination is the tendency to keep thinking about bad experiences. **Though rumination is a useful trait to discover sources of error or alternative strategies, it can make us miserable.**
- **Hedonic adaptation:** We have the tendency to return quickly to a baseline levle of satisfaction no matter what happens to as in life [@eyal2019indistractable, p. 32]. **This leads to all kinds of life events that we think would make us happier not lasting very long.**
:::

**Feeling bad isn't actually bad; it's exactly what survival of the fittest intended.** It is an innate power that can be channeled to help us make things better. 

. . .

> If we want to master distraction,   
we must learn to deal with discomfort.  *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 33]*

## Dealing with internal triggers

**Don't ignore the trigger, because mental abstinence can backfire.**
Resisting an urge can trigger rumination and make the desire grow stronger.

. . .

> An endless cycle of resisting, ruminating, and finally ginving in to the desire perpetuates the cycle and quite possibly drives many of our unwanted behaviours. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 36]*

. . .

Internal triggers can be managed by changing how we think about them.

. . .

#### Implications

Reimagine the trigger, the task, and your temperament.

## Reimagine the trigger

**An unpleasant internal trigger can be defused by reimagining it.**
Notice the urge and ride it like a surfer riding a wave, instead of giving in.

. . .

#### Implications

:::{.incremental}
- **Step 1:** Look for the emotion preceding distraction.
- **Step 2:** Write down the internal trigger (e.g, using an [distraction tracker](assets/distraction-tracker.pdf))
- **Step 3:** Acknowlege and explore your cravings with curiosity instead of contempt.
- **Step 4:** Be extra cautious during liminal moments[^liminal].
:::

[^liminal]: Liminal moments are *distraction traps* that transition us from one thing to another, like picking up our phone while waiting for a traffic light to change.

:::{.notes}
@eyal2019indistractable [p. 42] recommends the 'ten-minute-rule' [@mcgonigal2013willpower] to deal with distraction traps. When you are tempted to distraction, tell yourself that it's fine to give in, but not right now, just wait ten minutes. This rule allows time to do what some behavioral psychologist call 'urge surfing'. This accepting attitude allows an urge to grow and recede without taking action (to reduce negative affect or increase positive affect), when it takes hold [@ostafin2008surfing].
:::

## Reimagine the task

**By reimagining an otherwise dreary task, we can master internal triggers.**
Fun and play can be used as tools to keep us focused.

. . .

> Fun is looking for the variabiltiy in something other people don't notice. It's breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hiden beauty. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 48]*

. . . 

#### Implications

Look for challenges in (tedious) tasks—deliberateness and novelty can be added to any task to make it fun.

:::{.notes}
I try to make gardening more fun by soakcing up as much information as I can about the way grass (and weed) grows and how to treat it. I find it challenging to deal with the constraints I have (weather, tools, weed), be it fighting the weed or beating my record time in cutting grass. Operating under constraints is key to creativity and fun.
:::

## Reflect! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/exercise.jpg"}

Describe one frequent task you have to do that you see as boring.

What can you do to reimagine the task to make it feel more like play? What small challenges, constraints, or novelty can you add to make it fun?

## Reimagine your temperament

**We don’t run out of willpower.** 
Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.

:::{.notes}
Many studies offer evidence for a phenomenon called **ego depletion**—the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up [@baumeister2012willpower]. Some researchers also concluded that self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source (i.e., the fuel in our willpower tank). However, only recently @job2013beliefs concluded that only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. **People how did not see willpower as a finite resource did not show signs of ego depletion.**

There is also the viewpoint that willpower is not a finite resource, but acts like an emotion. Just as we don't "run dry" of joy or anger, willpower fluctuates depending on what is happening to us and how we are feeling. @eyal2019indistractable [p. 51] does concludes that "if mental engery is more like an emotion than fuel in a tank, it can be managed and utilized as such".
:::

. . .

**What we say to ourselves matters.**
Labeling yourself as having poor self-control (e.g., the cravings are stronger then my willpower) actually leads to less self-control.

. . .

#### Implications

**Belief in your willpower and practice self-compassion**, because people how do not see their willpower as limited resource *and* are more self-compassionate are more resilient.






# Traction {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/traction.jpg"}

> If you don't plan our time, someone else will help to waste it. *@ziglar2021born [p. 52]*

## Turn values into time

By being aware of your values (i.e., why you do what you do) and plan time to live up to your values, the difference between traction and distraction gets clear.

. . .

> We should stop worrying about outcomes we can't control and instead focus on the inputs we can. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 70]*

. . .

#### Implications

:::{.incremental}
- **Timebox your day[^timebox].** Plan time to live your values; plan time not only for work, but also for you (e.g., distraction) and your relationships.
- **Reflect and refine.** Revisit and refine your schedule regularly, but stick to it once it's set[@gollwitzer1999implementation].
:::

[^timebox]: There are several tutorials available on how to use a calendaring tool for timeboxing, see e.g., (How to Block Time on Google Calendar)[https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/block-time-google-calendar/].

:::{.notes}
@eyal2019indistractable [p. 63-64] recommends to set aside fifteen minutes a week to revisit and refine your calendar by asking following questions:

- When in my schedule did I do what I said I would do and when did I get distracted?
- What strategies can I use to manage the trigger next time?
- Are there changes I can make to my calendar that will give me the time I need to better express my values?

@eyal2019indistractable [p. 64] also advises creating a schedule as a curious scientist rather than a drill sergant. This gives the freedom to get better with each iteration.
:::

## Reflect! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/exercise.jpg"}

Values are not end goals; they are guidelines for our actions. 

What three to five values are most important to you?

What activities reflect these values?

How much time would you set aside each week for these activities?


## Schedule relationships

You and the people you love deserve more than getting the time you have left.

. . .

> This is how friendships die—they starve to death. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 78]*

. . .

#### Implications

:::{.incremental}
- **Schedule time for yourself first.** By not allocating time for yourself, relationships and work will suffer.
- **Schedule regular gatherings with loved ones.** A lack of close friendships may be hazardous to your health, so plan time for maintaining important relationships.
:::

## Sync at work

Defining how you spend your time and syncing your plans with the stakeholders in your life is critical for making time for traction in your day. Also at work.

. . .

> Without visibility into how you spend your time, colleagues and managers are more likely to distract you with superfluous tasks. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 87]*

. . .

#### Implications

**Sync your schedule with your boss and your team** to align expectations around how you spend your time. 

:::{.incremental}
- Get transparency in you schedule (e.g., use timeboxing)
- Ensure alignment on a regular basis (e.g., daily or weekly check-ins)
:::

# External triggers {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/external.jpg"}

> Today much of our struggle with distraction is a struggle with external triggers. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 94]*

## Problem statement

The ubiquity of external triggers like notifications, pings, alerts, etc. makes them hard to ignore—they are intentionally designed to change our behavior.

. . .

> Tech devices can gain unotherized access to our brains by prompting us to distraction [...] exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 92]*

. . .

For a behavior to occur, **three things must be present at the same time**: *motivation* (i.e., energy for action), *ability* (i.e., difficulty of a behavior), and a *trigger* [@fogg2009behavior].

. . .

So if we feel uncomfortable and the action is easy to perform, we just need a trigger to tell us what to do next.

## Review the trigger

Not all external triggers are harmful to our attention, we can also leverage them to our advantage.

. . .

> The trouble is, despite the potential benefits external triggers can provide, receiving too many can wreak havoc on our productivity and happiness. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 95]*

. . . 

#### Implications

:::{.incremental}
- **Ask the critical question:** is the trigger serving me, or am I serving it.
- If the trigger helps doing the thing planned, use it as a tool to stay on track.
- Hack back the external triggers that don't help you gain traction.
:::

## Reflect! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/exercise.jpg"}

What external triggers have you noticed during the last 30 minutes?

Have they changed your behavior? Why (not)?

Has the trigger served you living up to your values?


## Interruptions

**Interruptions lead to mistakes.** For critical activities, the work environment is designed to reduce disruption and distraction (e.g., sterile cockpit concept in nursing [see e.g., @broom2011critical]) 

. . .

**Even the presence of our smartphone may impose a "brain drain".** Research shows that our brain has to work hard to ignore our cell phone when it is in your field of vision—so ignoring is not very helpful [@ward2017brain].

. . .

#### Implications

**Defend your focus** and signal when you do not want to be interrupted.

## Hack back


Some strategies to hack back common work-related distractions

:::{.incremental}
- **Email:** To get fewer emails, send fewer emails. Tag each message with when it needs a reply and respond at a scheduled time.
- **Group chat:** Use it like a sauna and get in and out at scheduled time, only involve who is necessary ("the smaller the chat, the better the chat") and don't use it to think out loud ("slow down conversations").
- **Meetings:** Make it harder to call a meeting, no agenda, no meeting. Use the meeting for consensus not for problem-solving, be fully present and leave devices outside except for one laptop.
- **Apps:** Use distracting apps on your desktop rather than on your phone. Organize apps and manage notifications. Turn on *do not disturb* mode.
- **Browsing:** Save articles, read or listen at a scheduled time and use apps to makes consumption less distracting (e.g., [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.app/))

# Distraction {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/traction.jpg"}

> Being indistratable not only requires keeping distraction out, it also neccitates reining ourselves in. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 159]*


## Precommitments

After mastering internal and external triggers and making time for traction, **precommitments** help to prevent ourselves from distraction.

. . .

Precommitment means **removing a future choice** in order to overcome our impulsiveness (e.g., Ulysses pact, marriage, pension plans) [@kurth2012don]

. . .

> Precommitments are powerfull because they cement our intentions when we're clearheaded and make us less likely  to act against our best interests later. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 158]*

. . .

We can prevent distraction with *effort pacts*, *price pacts* and *identity pacts*.

## Reflect! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/exercise.jpg"}

Recall a precommitment you made that successfully helped you to become what you want to be. 

Why do you think this precommitment worked for you?

## Effort and price pacts

An **effort pact** prevents distraction by making unwanted behavior more difficult to perform, e.g. by

:::{.incremental}
- blocking access to distracting websites/tools or
- increasing social pressure by working next to someone).
:::

. . .

An **price pact** adds cost to getting distracted (e.g., losing money).

:::{.incremental}
- Price pacts are most effective when you can remove the external triggers that lead to distraction.
- Price pacts work best when the distraction is temporary.
:::


## Identity pacts

An *identity pact* is a precommitment to a self-image.

. . .

Research shows that an action (in this case, voting) that is presented as **an expression of the self**—a symbol of a person's fundamental character (e.g., being a voter)—more likely to be performed than if it is simply referred to as a behavior (e.g., to vote) [@bryan2011motivating].

. . .

#### Implications

:::{.incremental}
- **Become a noun:** call yourself "indistractable"
- **Share with others:** teaching others solidifies your commitment, even if you're struggling
- **Adopt rituals:** perform routines that reinforce your identity and influence your future actions [@tian2018enacting]
:::

## Workplace

> An 'always on' culture drives people crazy. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 270]*

Tech overuse at work is **a symptom of dysfunctional company culture** lacking pyschological safety.

. . .

Pyschological safety refers to "a shared belief amongst individuals as to whether it is safe to engage in interpersonal risk-taking in the workplace" (e.g., fighting distractions, timeboxing work) [@newman2017psychological, p. 522].

. . .

> Indistractable organizations, like Slack and BCG, foster psychological safety, provide a place for open discussions about concerns, and, most importantly, have leaders who exemplify the importance of doing focused work. *@eyal2019indistractable [p. 270]*

# Challenges

You want to learn how to control your attention and chose your life, in short to became indistractable? Here are three challenges that might help you along the way.

- **Level 1:** Observe yourself over the next few weeks, note when you have been distracted, analyze the cause, and consider how you might become less distracted. You might use the [distraction tracker](assets/distraction-tracker.pdf).
- **Level 2:** Take three weeks and consequently timebox your day in all life domains (e.g., you, relationships, work). Reflect an refine your schedule regularly, but commit to it, once it's set.
- **Level 3:** Engage with the people in your work context(s) (university, job), share the findings and strategies outlined here, discuss how you could apply the strategies to positively influence company culture and create an indistractable workplace, apply what you have agreed on and reflect the outcomes.
