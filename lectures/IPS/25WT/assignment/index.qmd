:::notes
You need to choose two topics in which you want to improve your interpersonal skills.

During the semester you will deeply reflect on these topics (based on the lectures and your own readings), take challenges that we present during the lectures, and try to improve.

At the end of the semester you will present a reflection on your personal “learning journey” with a focus on the challenges and theories presented and discussed during the lectures and/or with which you have been engaged.
:::

# Presentation

The presentation must reflect the contents of this course, **extended literature** and cover answers to following questions:

:::{.incremental}
-	Which topics did you choose for your personal development and why?
-	What challenges did you choose to grow in the field?
-	What changed during the 12 weeks?
-	How can you theoretically explain the effect(s)?[^1]    
-	What did you learn that you would recommend to others?
:::

[^1]: Deep reflection with current, high-quality peer-reviewed literature required to answer following questions: Why has it (not) worked; what are boundary conditions, what are the results of studies that have employed similar interventions, etc.;\
We expect you to use further literature, particularly peer reviewed studies wherever applicable

. . .

You will only present one topic during the presentation. The learnings and reflections regarding the second topic are documented on slides in the appendix of the presentation — these must be understandable without further oral explanation.

. . .

The presentation should take **min. 6 minutes, max.  7 minutes**; a short Q&A follows (approx. 4 minutes, focus on the theoretical reflection and understanding of literature).

------

In addition, we expect a personal learning presentation for an additional four topics. These slides should answer the question of what you take away from the lecture unit and should be included in the appendix, not presented.

# Grading

The grading is not based on the total amount of challenges you completed or how many of them were on level 3. 

. . .

We take into account your learning journey, your development over the course and the reflection with regard to the scientific literature.

. . .

If you decide to only complete challenges on level 1, however, it might be hard to gather enough material for a good or excellent presentation at the end. 

. . .

We strongly recommend maintaining a learning dictionary and documenting your progress. Taking pictures throughout your journey can also be helpful when preparing your final presentation. 

## Important notes

This is a master level course. This means, that **scientific concepts** and **understanding academic papers** are valued highly.
 
. . .

While the challenges are the basis for your presentation, the importance of the theoretical reflection is very high. Make sure that you connect your challenges to scientific, high quality papers[^qualityResearch]. 

We expect in-text citations (APA 7th) including page numbers.

[^qualityResearch]: If you did amazing challenges but only read 1-2 papers in your field, you will not receive a good grade. The same applies if you are only citing blog entries, homepages or books.

. . .

We will also ask about findings from these papers during the Q&A, so it is important to truly understand the underlying concepts.

## Evaluation criteria

An excellent presentation has the following characteristics

[Presentation]{.h4}

- The presenter is confident and easy to understand   
- The audience is engaged in an informative and entertaining way   
- The time was effectively and economically used   

. . .

[Learnings/development]{.h4}

- The student shows profound involvement with the challenges   
- The student clearly presents the results of his or her learning journey   
- The personal development during the course is comprehensible 

------

[Theoretical reflection]{.h4}

- The theoretical depth and breadth of the topics is explored   
- The personal learnings are reflected by (recent) theoretical or empirical findings   
- Profound knowledge of the topics is shown, even if tough questions are asked

. . .

[Knowledge of literature]{.h4}

- The student has a solid understanding of the cited papers

## Submission

You need to upload the slides (pdf) and the articles cited (zip) on [Moodle](https://elearning.hnu.de/mod/assign/view.php?id=673352).

- Name the presentation as follows: studentNumber_lastName-preName_IPS-slides.pdf (e.g., 234563_hans-dampf_IPS-slides.pdf)
- Collect **all the articles** used in your presentation as full-texts (pdf)
- Name the files as follows: author_year_short-title (e.g., Hallegatte_2009_EnvironmentalChange.pdf)
- Compress the full-texts (pdf) of **all** articles cited in a zip file
- Name the zip file as follows: studentNumber_lastName-preName_IPS-sources.pdf (e.g., 234563_hans-dampf_IPS-sources.pdf)
