#### Rules for virtual Zoom sessions

We aim to have on-site lectures only. However, if we need to move to Zoom, following rules apply:

__Keeping cameras on__ makes us feel more connected to the persons we are interacting with. As we want to connect and as we plan highly interactive sessions, you need to keep your camera on. Keeping cameras off is inappropriate and feels rude.

We also expect that you are __super attentive__—just as if you were in the seminar room. No multitasking, no power-nap etc. (a virtual lecture is not a video stream like on Netflix ;-)
