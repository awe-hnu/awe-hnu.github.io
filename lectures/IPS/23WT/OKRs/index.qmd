# Prologue {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They've helped make our cazily bold mission of "organizing the world's information" perhaps even achievable. They've kepts me and the rest of the company on track when it mattered the most. *Larry Page, cofounder and former CEO of Google*

:::{.notes}
This class is about OKRs, a concept that helps busy, productive, and innovative teams to focus. OKRs provide a framework that does not inhibit exploring the new, but rather channels it towards accomplishing prioritized goals.

## History

:::html-hidden
:::large
[OKR = **O**bjectives and **K**ey **R**esults]{.fragment .fade-in}

[Has evolved]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[from **Intel** (iMBO, 1970)]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[to **Google** (OKR, 1999)]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[to a widely used management tool]{.fragment .fade-in} 
:::
:::

:::notes

OKR stands for **Objectives and Key Results** and is a management method to help companies, teams, and individuals set, measure, and reflect on goals in a structured, meaningful way.

- Andrew Grove[^Grove] popularized the concept during his time at Intel in the 1970s [@grove2015high].
- During his time at IBM, John Doerr was introduced to the theory of OKR, then called "iMBOs" ("Intel Management by Objectives") [@doerr2018measure].
- Working for venture capital firm introduced the idea of OKRs to Google in 1999 [@levy2021plex]. 
- OKRs quickly became a central part of Google's culture as a "management methodology that helps to ensure that the
company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization." [@doerr2018measure, p.7]

[^Grove]: Former CEO of Intel, who has transformed Intel from a manufacturer of memory chips into the world's dominant producer of microprocessors.

## Objective

:::html-hidden
:::large
[Audacious objectives]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}   
[= the stuff of inspiration and far horizons—*the what*]{.fragment}
:::
:::

. . .

> We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we’re willing to accept. *John F. Kennedy, 12.09.1962*

:::notes
The objective is the goal, what the company, team, or individual aims to achieve—*the what*.

- Goals express **goals and intents**,
- are **aggressive yet realistic**,
- must be **tangible**, **objective**, and **unambiguous**,
- provide **clear value**, and
- must be **action-oriented**.

*Example: Create the lowest carbon footprint in our industry.*

:::

## Key results

:::fragment
:::large
Key results are **benchmarks toward the objective**—*the how*
:::
:::

. . .

Key results are more earthbound and metric driven, they cover things such as revenue, growth, active users, satisfaction scores, etc.

:::notes

- They state the **3-5 measurable sub-goals** that define/reflect goal-achievement
- describe **outcomes, not activities**,
- are **time-bound** (they include specific deadlines),
- are **black-and-white**[^black-white],
- are relatively **challenging**[^challenge], and
- must include **evidence of completion**[^evidence].

[^black-white]: One either succeed in achieving a key result, or don’t
[^challenge]: If a key result seems easy, it, or the objective, may not be ambitious enough
[^evidence]: Data need to be available, credible, and easily discoverable

*Example: Pay 100% carbon offset for calculated carbon dioxide emissions.*

Scoring
:::

One way to score is to use a scale of 0 to 100% based on how much of the key result was completed.

- `71-100%` is a *green* on target: continue.
- `30-70%` is a *yellow* on target: continue or revise.
- `0-29%` is a *red* on target: revise or stop.

:::callout-note
#### Options for OKRs

Option #1: Continue
: The objective or key result—If everything’s going well and you’re making progress,keep going.

Option #2: Revise
: The objective or key result—If changes in your environment or workflow have caused the goal to get off track, update it.

Option #3: Start
: A new objective or key result—As conditions change, you may need to add new goals. If you already have five objectives, put one or two on the back burner to make room for the new goal.

Option #4: Stop
: An objective or key result—Some goals become irrelevant or impractical. Don’t stubbornly cling to a goal just because you set it. If it no longer serves your larger purpose or thecompany’s, toss it.

[+ start top-down]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}    
[+ make OKRs visible]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}    
[+ align bottom-up]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}     
:::
:::

:::notes

Companies that use this system have **OKRs at every tier**: Top-line OKRs for the entire company, division OKRs, team OKRs, and individual OKRs. 

- Everyone in the company creates OKRs.
- Individuals and teams are responsible for making sure that their goals help further the company's objective.
- Everyone’s OKRs are visible to everyone else[^alignment].

This combination of top-down and bottom-up alignment provides the **transparency** needed for people to connect their goals with those of the company and their peers, increases **efficiency** and leaves room for **innovation**.

[^alignment]: If anyone’s OKRs aren’t aligned with the top-line OKRs, it’s obvious.

:::

## OKR vs. traditional systems {visibility=hidden}

::::columns

::: column
#### Traditional management systems

- Key question: What’s the goal?
- Emphasizes on ticking off
- Objectives are private
- Alignment is top-down (objectives trickle down from the CEO to frontline employees)
- Success of objectives is tied to compensation
- System encourages risk-aversion
:::

:::column
#### OKRs

- Key questions: What’s the goal, and how will we get there?
- Emphasizes ambition
- Objectives are public (even those of the CEO)
- Alignment is top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal
- Usually not linked to promotion and bonuses
- System encourages risk-taking (aiming for a risk-taking culture)

# Implementation {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

Some guidelines on how to implement the OKR system based on @doerr2018measure.

## Implementation steps {.html-hidden}

:::{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=1}    
[Set objectives]{.fragment .large .highlight-current-blue fragment-index=2}   
[Start with the biggest priorities, set 3-5 objectives per tier]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=2}
:::

## Step 1: Identitfy the objectives  {visibility=hidden}

Start with the company’s biggest priorities. Ask yourself, *“What are the most important tasks we need to accomplish in the next three months, the next six months, and the next year?”*

Once the organization-level objectives have been set, departments, teams, and individuals identify their own objectives.

- About 50% of a tier's objectives trickle down from the top
- Every objective, regardless of whether it’s an individual or department objective, should align with the company’s top objectives
- At each tier, **tackle no more than 3-5 objectives**
- Everyone’s objectives need to be public, including the CEO’s

## Group work—part #1 {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden background-color=black}
 
Imagine you would be part of [Uber](https://www.uber.com) right after the company was founded as Ubercap in 2009. Ubers vision is to ease and reduce the cost of direct transportation (getting from point A to point B) by setting up a transportation platform (two-sided market). To realize your vision, the founders defined some top-level goals

Now, imagine you are part of Uber and responsible for one functional area at Uber (business development, marketing, app development, IT operations, finance, HR).

- Open the [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMwNWkEU=/?share_link_id=811526720517)
- Brainstorm objectives that relate to the top-line OKRs
- Select the two that are most important for Q2/2009
- Develop OKRs

## Implementation steps {.html-hidden}

:::{.large .semi-fade-out-fixed} 
Set objectives
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=4}    
:::{.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=6}    
[Set key results]{.fragment .large .highlight-current-blue fragment-index=5}   
[Let employees create key results, 3-5 per objective]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=5}
:::
:::


## Step 2: Identify the key results {visibility=hidden}

For each objective, ask yourself, “What steps do I need to complete to reach my objective?”

- Only **3-5 key results per objective**
- If more key results are required to reach an objective, the objective is not narrow enough or not framed well
- Key results need to be specific, comprehensive, and aligned. Successfully completing the key results must
culminate in achieving the objective
- Everyone's key results **need to be public**
- Employees should create most of their own key results, whether the objective comes from the top or not

## Step 3: Define OKR cycle length {visibility=hidden}

The organization should operate on the same goal-setting schedule.

. . .

For most companies, there are two simultaneous OKR cycles:

- **Annual cycles** are for long-term OKRs
- **Quarterly cycles** are for short-term OKRs that support the longer-term objectives

### Quarterly OKR rhythm

OKRs should be conducted quarterly, with a rhythm of check-ins, reviews, and scoring goals, as seen below.

![A typical OKR cycle](images/rhythm.svg){#fig-cycle}

## Group work—part #2 {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden background-color=black}
 
Take the two OKRs you have developed and create three to five key results.

## Implementation steps {.html-hidden}

[Check in weekly or monthly, score & reflect, repeat cycle]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=5}
:::
:::

## Step 4: Set up tooling and roles {visibility=hidden}

To effectively track OKRs, you need a place to store and share them—use a **cloud-based management system**[^system].

[^system]: For instance: [Ally](https://ally.io/), [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), [Weekdone](httsp://weekdone.com) or shared documents

. . .

Designate an **"OKR shepherd"** (or OKR master) who is in charge of keeping the rest of the team or organization accountable for setting and work hard toward their OKRs.

## Step 5: Walk the talk {visibility=hidden}

**Check in with employees weekly or monthly**

- Check progress on key-results and related initiatives
- Reassess OKRs, if they are not longer relevant, change or discard them

. . .

**Score and reflect**

- Score your performance for each OKR at the end of the cycle
- Reflect on how you did and what that means about the goals you set    
*What will you do differently next quarter?*

. . .

**Repeat the OKR cycle**

## Focus

:::large
> If we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. *Andy Grove, former CEO of intel*
:::
 
:::notes

**Commit to priorities**    

- Top-line objectives must be significant
- Keep the number of objectives small
- Every time you commit to something, you make yourself unavailable to commit to something else—*choose your commitments wisely*

**Focus on what is necessary** 

- Reflect on what is required to get you to the objective 
- Clarify your focus by limiting you to **3-5 key results per objective**

The most powerful OKRs typically stem from insights outside the C-suite. As @grove2015high observed, People in the trenches are usually in touch with impending changes early. Salespeople understand shifting customer demands before management does; financial analysts are the earliest to know when the fundamentals of a business change.

A healthy OKR environment strikes a balance between alignment and autonomy, common purpose and creative latitude.

:::

. . .

Innovation is located less at the center of an organization than at its edges [@doerr2018measure].

:::notes

> The professional employee needs rigorous performance standards and high goals. [...] But how he does his work should always be his responsibility and his decision. *@drucker2007practice*

> [T]he subordinate will begin to take a much more restricted view of what is expected of him, showing less initiative in solving his own problems and referring them instead to his [or her] supervisor. [...] [T]he output of the organization will consequently be reduced. *@grove2015high*

:::

## Align and connect

:::large
> Having goals improves performance. Spending hours cascading goals up and down the company, however, does not. *Laszlo Bock, former HR executive at Google*
:::

:::notes

**OKRs are public and use both top-down and bottom-up alignment**

- Let individuals set about 50% of their own goals and most of their key results[^Responsibility]
- For the goals set, clearly show how they relate to the top priorities
- Use meetings to reiterate why certain OKRs are important
- Encourage cross-departmental OKRs for horizontal alignment and make dependencies explicit

[^Responsibility]: People who choose their goals take more responsibility toward getting themselves there.

:::

## Group work—part #3 {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden background-color=black}

Review the OKRs of all teams and discuss following questions:

- Are there any dependencies between the OKRs of the different teams?
- Do you see a way to adapt the OKRs to create cross-functional OKR?
- What advantage would these have?

## Track for accountability

:::html-hidden
:::large
OKRs are **always measurable.**
:::
:::

. . .

> In God we trust; all others must bring data. *W. Edwards Deming, American engineer, statistician, professor, and author*

:::notes

**OKRs are always measurable:** Scores help you track your progress, indicate when you need to double down on a particular goal, or when you should revise or abandon it

**Use objective scoring, subjective self-assessment, and reflection**

- Assign an objective score *(e.g., average the completion rates of its key results)*
- Balance objective scores with self-assessments *(i.e., tell the whole story)*
- Learn from your experiences *(e.g., what facilitators, roadblocks, takeaways)*

:::

## Stretch for amazing

:::html-hidden
:::large
Balance **committed OKRs** and **stretch OKRs**.
:::
:::

:::fragment
> The biggest risk of all is not taking one. *Mellody Hobson, chairwoman of Starbucks, and former chairwoman of DreamWorks*
:::

:::notes

OKRs should be a mix of *committed OKRs*, objectives that must be met for the company to function and thrive, and *aspirational OKRs*, objectives that make you feel a little uncomfortable because you’re unsure you can attain them. These kinds of OKRs stretch the entire company to achieve more than anyone thought possible, a key feature of innovative companies.

Committed
: A goal that will be achieved. Resources and schedules should be adjusted to
make sure they get done. You either achieved it or you didn’t.

. . .

Stretch OKR
: Ambitious goals with no clear path to get there. They may roll over from quarter to quarter, or year to year, and sometimes even be reassigned to different teams. Reaching 100% of an aspirational OKR is rare, expect a score between 40% and 60%.

## Continuous performance management

:::html-hidden
:::large
OKRs foster CFRs[—***c*onversations**]{.fragment .fade-in}[, ***f*eedback** ]{.fragment .fade-in} [& ***r*ecognition**]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::
:::

. . .

> Talking can transform minds, which can transform behaviors, which can transform institutions. *Sheryl Sandberg, former Co-CEO of Meta*

:::notes

OKRs enable the implementation of an continuous performance management system built on CFRs:

- ***C* onversations**: exchange between manager and contributor aimed to thrive performance
- ***F* eedback**: bidirectional networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement
- ***R* ecognition**: expression of appreciation from peers and managers for small and large contributions toward goals

### Conversations

Conversations happen weekly or monthly, in both formal and informal environments and concern five main topic areas (but you don’t need to cover all of them in one conversation):

1. **Reflecting** on past goals and setting new ones.
2. **Updates on OKR progress**, problem-solving if necessary.
3. **Coaching** to guide the employee in his or her thinking about the OKR approach, and encourage the employee to offer feedback to help you, the manager, do your job better.
4. **Professional development** by working with the employee to develop the necessary skills, knowledge, and mindset to succeed at the company.
5. **“Lightweight” performance reviews** by discussing what the employee has accomplished since yourlast meeting, and view this progress within the context of the company’s priorities and needs.

### Feedback {visibility=hidden}

In order to improve, employees need to know how they’re doing—often, they don’t have enough distance from their work and performance to make this call themselves.

You can **elicit and guide feedback** in one-on-one meetings with these questions:

- Employee: Do you have any feedback on how I could improve my performance, make more progress toward my goals, or set more ambitious OKRs?
- Manager: What do you need from me to succeed?

### Recognition {visibility=hidden}

Recognition should be both private and public and **focused on actions.**

There are many ways to establish a “high-recognition” culture:

- **Introduce a peer-to-peer recognition system.** E.g., introduce [Whoops-a-Daisy & the Killer Whale](../communication/assets/whoops-a-daisy-and-killer-whale.pdf)
- **Focus on actions and results.** Instead of honoring an *Employee of the Month*, honor an *Achievement of the Month*. Celebrate people for what they do, particularly when they complete OKRs that contribute to company goals or they demonstrate company values.
- **Link recognition to the company’s goals.** When you have a particular, company-wide OKR you’re trying to push, focus recognition on the people who are helping the company make progress toward it.

> You need a culture that high-fives small and innovative ideas. *Jeff Bezos, founder, executive chairman, and former president and CEO of Amazon*

:::

## OKRs and CRF build a positive culture

:::notes
OKRs and CFRs help to align teams to **work toward a handful of common, meaningful objectives** (OKR) and to unit them through **lightweight, goal-oriented communications** (CFR). More specifically, google found that standout performance correlated to following characteristics [@rozokovsky2015fivekeys], which are forstered by OKRs and CFRs: 

**Structure & clarity**[^Q1], **psychological safety**[^Q2], **meaning of work**[^Q3], m**dependability**[^Q4] & **impact of work**[^Q5].

## Exercise {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden background-color=black}

Goal setting has become an important part of motivation theory. However, @schweitzer2004goal show that, in addition to motivating constructive effort, goal setting motivates unethical behavior when people fall short of their goals.

Revisit the [paper](assets/SchweitzerEtAl_2004_AMJ_Goal-Setting-as-a-motivator-for-unethical-behavior.pdf) and discuss your findings to following questions:

- Why are people with specific goals more likely to overstate their productivity than people without goals?
- Why are people who fall marginally short of their goals more likely to falsely claim to have achieved their goals than people who fall far short of their goals?
- What factors influence the relationship between goal setting and unethical behavior?
- How does OKR help to mitigate the "dark sides of goal setting"?

# Challenges

You want to learn how to increase your accountability for your performance, in any walk of life?

:::{.incremental}
- **Level 1:** *Focus and commit.* Brainstorm your objectives for this semester. Write them down. Apply the quality checklist to each objective. Commit to 3 to 5 objectives that are most important for the upcoming four weeks. After four weeks, reflect if and why (not) this helped you to gain focus.
- **Level 2:** *Define the deliverables.* Do the level 1 challenge. Develop 3-5 key results for each objective selected[^formula]. Track the progress on a weekly basis. Reflect if and why (not) this helps you to keep [traction](../indistractable/#traction-and-distraction).
- **Level 3:** Do the level 1 and level 2 challenges as soon as possible Ask someone to be your "manager". In the upcoming four weeks, do weekly check-ins with her/him applying the CFR framework. Reflect if and why (not) this helps you to become more accountable and to achieve your goals.
