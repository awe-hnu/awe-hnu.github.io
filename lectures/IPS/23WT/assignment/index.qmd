# Task

::: {.html-hidden .large}
[Select two topics,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [take on challenges,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [reflect your learning journey]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [& present your findings]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

:::notes
You need to choose at least two topics in which you want to improve your interpersonal skills.

During the semester you will deeply reflect on these topics (based on the lectures and your own readings), take challenges that we present during the lectures, and try to improve.

At the end of the semester you will present a reflection on your personal “learning journey” with a focus on the challenges and theories presented and discussed during the lectures and/or with which you have been engaged.

You will chose one topic during the kick-off and another during the course of the module.
:::

# Presentation

The presentation must reflect the contents of this course, extended literature and cover answers to following questions:

:::{.incremental}
-	Which topics did you choose for your personal development and why?
-	What challenges did you choose to grow in the field?
-	What changed during the 12 weeks?
-	How can you explain the mode of action and effect(s) of the challenge(s)?[^1]    
  --> Literature required!
-	What did you learn that you would recommend to others?
:::

[^1]: Why has it (not) worked; what are boundary conditions, what are the results of studies that have employed similar interventions, etc.; we expect you to use further literature, particularly peer reviewed studies wherever applicable

 . . .

The presentation should take min. 8 minutes, max. 9 minutes; a short Q&A follows (approx. 4 minutes).

# Grading

The grading is not based on the total amount of challenges you completed or how many of them were on level 3. 

. . .

We take into account your learning journey, your development over the course and the reflection with regard to the scientific literature.

. . .

If you decide to only complete challenges on level 1, however, it might be hard to gather enough material for a good or excellent presentation at the end. 

. . .

We strongly recommend maintaining a learning dictionary and documenting your progress. Taking pictures throughout your journey can also be helpful when preparing your final presentation. 

## Important notes

**This is a master level course. This means, that scientific concepts and understanding academic papers are valued highly.**
 
. . .

While the challenges are the basis for your presentation, the importance of the theoretical reflection is very high. If you did amazing challenges but only read 1-2 papers in your field, you will not receive a good grade. The same applies if you are only citing blog entries, homepages or books. Make sure that you connect your challenges to scientific, high quality papers.

. . .
 
We will do a short intro how to find them.
 
. . .

We will also ask about findings from these papers, so it is important to truly understand the underlying concepts.

## Evaluation criteria

An excellent presentation has the following characteristics

Presentation
: The presenter is confident and easy to understand   
The audience is engaged in an informative and entertaining way   
The time was effectively and economically used   

. . .

Learnings/development
: The student shows profound involvement with the challenges   
The student clearly presents the results of his or her learning journey   
The personal development during the course is comprehensible 

. . .

Theoretical reflection
: The theoretical depth and breadth of the topics is explored   
The personal learnings are reflected by (recent) theoretical or empirical findings   
Profound knowledge of the topics is shown, even if tough questions are asked

. . .

Knowledge of literature
: The student has a solid understanding of the cited papers

## Submission
