# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> Challenging others and encouraging them to challenge you helps build trusting relationships because it shows 1) **you care** enough to point out both the things that aren’t going well and those that are and that 2) you are willing to admit when you’re wrong and that **you are committed to fixing mistakes** that you or others have made. *@scott2019radical*

## Discussion {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden background-color=black}

Decide for the bright or the dark side, reflect on the related questions below, and discuss your findings with your neighbor(s) (approx 10 minutes).

Bright side:

- Who are the best leaders you have worked for in your career?    
- What made them so exceptional? 
- What can you learn?

Dark side:

- Tell a story about the worst boss you ever had.     
- What did he or she do that made them so bad? 
- How can you avoid those mistakes?

## Care for people  {.html-hidden .unlisted .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

> You were also born with a capacity to connect, to care personally. Somehow the training you got to “be professional” made you repress that. Well, stop repressing your innate ability to care personally. Give a damn! *@scott2019radical*

## Leadership

@scott2019radical advices leaders to be guided by two principles: 

[**Caring personally**]{.fragment .large .fade-in}    
[Care about your people on a personal level]{.fragment}

[AND]{.fragment .large .fade-in}    

[**Challenging directly**]{.fragment .large .fade-in}    
[Have conversations where you criticize or disagree with decisions your people made]{.fragment}

:::notes
As a leader, a significant aspect of your job is **dealing with the personal and professional problems** of the people that report to you or work with you in a less hierarchical setting. Kim Scott[^Scott] even states that **relationship maintenance** should be a top priority when you move into a leadership position. She advises leaders in radical candid communication [@scott2019radical]—straightforward and humanizing management, following the principles outlined below

[^Scott]: A leader of high-profile teams in the Silicon Valley at Google, Apple and Twitter.

#### Caring personally

Caring personally means caring about people for more than just their jobs. As a leader, you need to care about them on a personal level. This includes learning more about them as a person—their interests, motivations, and ambitions—and learning more about their **"whole self"**—who they are outside of work and how their personal life might impact their needs at work.

When you show that you care personally about your employees, their **trust** in you grows. This has far-reaching implications: When your employees trust you and feel that you have their best interests at heart, they will be honest with you, more receptive to your feedback, and more confident in your decisions. Likewise, you will find that you can be more honest with them and have more confidence in their decisions.

We often fail to care personally. One reason is that work culture encourages us to **stay professional** and **hide our feelings**. Another one, less virtuous, is a tendency to become arrogant once you find yourself in a boss chair.


#### Challenging directly

Challenging directly means having difficult but necessary conversations with your employees, e.g., conversations where you criticize or disagree with decisions they've made. These conversations might feel too difficult, especially if you haven't had a chance to build a caring, trusting relationship with the person in question. However, you have to let the principle of challenging directly drive you into these discussions for several important reasons.

First, these conversations offer the recipient of the feedback an opportunity to improve and avoid further problems and difficult conversations. Second, by being direct, you show that you care about the person and their improvement enough to put up with the inconvenience of a difficult conversation. This, of course, helps you build a trusting relationship with the person you are talking to.

If, on the other hand, you didn't adhere to the principles of radical openness and avoided the conversation, your employee would continue to fall short - and he would probably know it. If you constantly reassure him that everything is "fine," it shows that you are not being honest with him when necessary, and that destroys the potential for a trusting relationship.

![Radical Candor framework [@scott2019radical]](images/framework.svg){#fig-framework}

The framework is meant as a compass to guide individual conversations to a better place.

Being radical candid, you can and should

- **criticize**—but only with the noble aim to help see mistakes and correct them. Praise from a place of radical candor is very specific to the recipient—when you’re acting with radical candor, you should be attuned to how your praise is landing with your recipient and be prepared to change it if it’s not quite right.
- **praise**—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements. Criticism from a place of radical candor is always sincere, and is given both when things go poorly and when things go well.

If you succeed in two of the dimensions, your guidance is Radical Candor. But what if you fail, in one of those or in both? To demonstrate that, @scott2019radical draws a coordinate system, where *care personally* is Y, and *challenge directly* is X. This way, she comes up with three other types of guidance, analyzing those through the prism of criticism and praise.

#### Obnoxious aggression

Obnoxious aggression happens when a boss treats employees without respect, belittling and publicly embarrassing them. Obnoxiously aggressive criticism can be effective but at a very high cost: it “sometimes gets great results short-term but leaves a trail of dead bodies in its wake in the long run.” Similarly, praising people aggressively (for example, under wrong circumstances) can make them feel underestimated or even ashamed instead of valued.

#### Manipulative insincerity

Manipulative insincere guidance is the result of a leader's desire to be liked and take advantage of it. In this case, both criticism and praise are used to play on other people’s emotions. Even aggressive obnoxious guidance is better—at least, you know what to expect.

#### Ruinous empathy

Ruinous Empathy occurs when bosses are trying to reduce tension but instead create even more pain, prioritizing friendly communication over improving performance. Ruinously empathetic bosses do not criticize at all – they do not insist on solving issues but rather let them go. Their praise is superficial and feels like flattery, not proved by any serious background.

Radical Candor is different. You can criticize—but only with the noble aim to help see mistakes and correct them. You can praise—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements.

## Understanding motivation {visibility="hidden"}

To build an effective team, a leader must recognize the **diversity of its members**. 

@scott2019radical divides workers in two categories—rock stars and superstars.

- **Rock stars** are on a **gradual growth trajectory**:    
They are happy in their current role and focus on stability.   
To motivate rock stars, you can give them bonuses or simply say thank you for their work. 
- **Super stars** are on a **steep growth path**:     
They always look for a change and are very ambitious.    
Super stars get inspired when you constantly challenge them and give them new opportunities.

Cohesiveness of a team depends on the contributions of both rock stars and superstars, in a proportion that is relevant to a particular type of work.

These labels are not permanent—growth trajectories and goals change constantly, based on work or life events that dictate the amount of work someone can take on. Someone who was once a high performer may reach a point where they’re no longer invested in the work and become a low performer, or one of your superstars may have a situation in their home life that slows their growth for the time being. For example, Scott—usually in a superstar role—found herself needing extra time to readjust after the birth of her twins. She asked to be placed in a rock star role for several years, allowing her to spend more time with her family. When she was ready, she jumped back onto her superstar trajectory.

Because circumstances are constantly changing, it’s important that you frequently check in with your employees to learn about what’s going on in their lives, talk about their ambitions, and ensure that their growth trajectory suits them. Some recommendations:

- Superstars: Make sure you’re offering them challenges and projects that will help them continue to learn.
- Rock stars: Make sure you’re offering them what they need to feel appreciated and continue doing consistent strong work.
- Mediocre: Think of what you can offer them to give them a boost, such as classes or projects, or consider if they’d do better elsewhere.
- Low performance with expected rapid growth: Think of what you can offer them in terms of clearer guidelines, better training, or a transfer to a role they’re better suited for.


## Building trusting relationships

Let your team be fully engaged in the work, try to better understand the needs of your team members, and make their work meaningful to them.

. . .

To build trusting relationships with your team, @scott2019radical recommends the following:

:::html-hidden
[Practice self-care]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .large}    
[Give autonomy]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .large}    
[Respect boundaries]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out .large}
:::

:::notes

Practicing self-care
: Without personal care, you can’t build radically candid relationships—integrate work and life and find a self-care method that makes you feel like your best self.

. . .

Giving autonomy
: When people feel a sense of agency and autonomy, they choose to bring their best selves to their work—don't force someone to do his/her best.

. . .

Respecting boundaries
: Make an effort to learn about your team mates’ whole selves, while being conscious of their limits—stay open to new perspectives, tune in to your own emotions, and find out how to deal with others' emotions.

# Some guidance {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

## Getting feedback

To built trust, you should first ask for radically candid guidance—seeing you react well to criticism will naturally build your team’s trust and their respect.

. . .

@scott2019radical proposes following steps to take when asking a team for criticism.

:::{.incremental .html-hidden}
- Step #1: **Request public criticism**   
—foster trust and psychological safety
- Step #2: **Kick things off with a question**    
—what can I ... ?
- Step #3: **Push through discomfort to get answers**   
—wait a few seconds
- Step #4: **Manage your response**   
—listen with the intent to understand, don't get defensive
- Step #5: **Demonstrate your gratitude**   
—reward the candor by getting it and working to address it
:::

:::notes

#### Request public criticism

As a leader, you need to be willing to be publicly criticized to 

- demonstrate to your team that there’s value in criticism, and that its intent is to make everyone better at their jobs—
not to be hurtful;
- establish you as a strong leader who isn’t afraid to make mistakes and is open to learning;
- to get everyone’s feedback as efficiently a spossible; and
- to save time by hearing each criticism once, instead of over and over again across multiple meetings.

#### Kick things off with a question

Asking questions can provide a jumping-off point for coming up with issues that need addressing, and helps cut through the discomfort of offering criticism, e.g.

- How can I better support you?
- What is something I’m doing that you find frustrating?

Keep a close eye on the balance of praise and criticism you’re receiving in public feedback sessions. 

#### Push through discomfort to get answers

Hesitation and silence don’t indicate an absence of issues—they indicate that you’llhave to keep pushing to get sincere feedback from your employees. There are several ways to accomplish this:

- **Create silence**: count to six after asking for criticism. Your employee may be more uncomfortable with silence than with criticizing you, and will say what’s on their mind to fill the space.
- **Keep asking**: Keep insisting that they come up with something.
- **Notice body language**: If someone says they have no criticism, but their body language clearly says otherwise, bring it to their attention.

#### Manage your response

When someone offers you criticism, it’s crucial that you respond in a way that shows that their criticism iswelcome and well-received—this is where trust is built.

- Don’t tell them how their criticism is wrong or not radically candid.
- Be careful not to become angry or defensive in response to what they’re saying. 
- Listen with the intent to clarify and fullyunderstand the criticism. 
- Repeat what’s been said and checking that your interpretation is correct.

#### Demonstrate your gratitude

Showing your gratitude for criticism encourages people to keep giving it. **The best way to show gratitude for criticism is responding with demonstrated change.**

- If it’s a change that can be done right away, do so. 
- If it’s a change that can’t be accomplished right away, make a perceptible effort toward the change

It’s important to express gratitude for criticism even when you think it’s unfair, or don’t agree. Arguing with or dismissing criticism you disagree with will only serve to undermine the trust you’re trying to build, so instead focus on ways to work through it.

Steps you should take, if you do not agree:

- Find something in the criticism that you can agree with 
- Make sure you fully understand what the other person is expressing
- Tell them you’d like to think about it and get back to them. 
- In your follow-up, explain clearly why you disagree, or why making a change won’t be possible.

Once you get the ball rolling and your employees are gaining confidence in giving you guidance, you need to start giving them guidance in return.

## Giving feedback

Before you offer praise or criticism, do these three things:      
[**get clear** in your own mind about why your feedback is helpful,]{.fragment}     
[**share your intention** to be helpful,]{.fragment} [and **clearly show** what is good or bad.]{.fragment}

. . .

@scott2019radical offers some guiding principles to help you commit to radical candor and to best set up your employees for sincere feedback:

:::{.incremental .html-hidden}
- Focus #1: **Humility**—your goal is shared understanding
- Focus #2: **Helpfulness**—you are doing this to help
- Focus #3: **Immediacy**—in the moment, or shortly thereafter
- Focus #4: **In-person**—not via text
- Focus #5: **Public praise, private criticism**
- Focus #6: **Caring personally does not mean personalizing**
:::

:::notes

#### Humility

Humility is important in both criticism and praise. Criticism without humility can make people feel defensive, and praise without humility can sound insincere or arrogant. There are three concepts on which humble leadership should be based:

- **Precise framing of your feedback**: When you’re giving feedback, frame it around three things—the situation, the person’s behavior, and the outcome. This helps you avoid arrogant generalizations about the person, both in criticism and praise.
- **An effective filter**: After feedback that didn’t go well, write down what was actually said in the conversation and what you were thinking during the conversation—this helps you to figure out where the conversation went wrong.
- **Separation of reality and experience**: Remember that your experience or subjective observation of a situation is not necessarily the objective truth—this will help you invite challenge as much as you hand it out. Give people the opportunity to tell you about their reality.

#### Helpfulness

Radically candid feedback does the heavy lifting by clarifying what the problem is, so your employee can find the solution more quickly—this is accomplished through three helpful actions:

- **Making your intentions clear.** Criticism usually prompts defensive reactions. When you state that your intent is to help, not to be hurtful, your employees become more receptive to your feedback.
- **Being as precise as possible.** It’s tempting to give vague criticism so you don’t have to dive into the discomfort of fully discussing a tough situation. Precision about what’s good or bad about someone’s behavior clearly demonstrates what they should do more or less of.
- **Outsourcing help when possible.** Helping each of your team members personally with their issues would be impossibly time-consuming. Instead, look for external help to offer to your employees when appropriate and available.

#### Immediacy

Feedback is most effective when it comes immediately after a situation that deserves attention. It's not a good idea to save feedback for meetings for several reasons:

- You run the risk of forgetting the very thing you wanted to talk about or the specifics of a situation.
- You'll often find that problems are too far in the past to be fixed, or that successes are too far in the past to build on. 

Consistent feedback allows employees to understand and contextualize how their work is perceived or used. Without the context that comes with praise or criticism, employees feel that their work is not noticed or appreciated and become unmotivated and bored with their work.

Make sure your schedule allows for post-meeting feedback by stopping meetings 5 minutes before schedule, or by scheduling meetings a minimum of 15 minutes apart. **Good feedback doesn’t need to take a long time—the best feedback is consistent and specific.**

#### In-Person

It’s best to deliver your feedback in person—you can see how your feedback is being received by theother person, and you avoid misunderstandings that can come from the nuances of written communication.

#### Public praise, private criticism

As a general rule of thumb, you should always default to giving praise in public and criticism in private.

- Public praise tends to be more meaningful for the recipient and demonstrates what your team should do more of.
- Public criticism tends to trigger defensiveness.

#### Caring personally does not mean personalizing

When giving criticism, make sure that you are criticizing the problem or the idea, rather than the person. Attributing a character trait to someone as an explanation for their behavior doesn’t get to the root of the problem. 

**If your criticism starts with “you’re,” rethink it.**

:::notes

Considering the **CORe method** increases probability that your praise tells the other person what was good and shows them what to do more of.

Example: *“After the meeting, when I told you that you said ‘um’ a lot and recommended a speech coach (C), you made a brush-off gesture (O). This makes me feel like you weren’t hearing me and won’t go to the speech coach I’m recommending, which would be a shame 
because if you stop saying ‘um’ so much, you’ll be more effective (R). Go to the damn speech 
coach (E)!”*

:::notes
How to set-up feedback discussions depends on so many things, e.g., the issue you are addressing and the relationship to another. However, following things should be considered any way [@hbr2016feedback]:

1. **Consider the logistics** when you prepare for feedback discussions. It's easy to take our surroundings for granted, but they have a big impact on any interaction. Paying attention to details like these will help make conversations more productive.
  - **Timimg.** Choose a time when you and the other person will both at your best, e.g., at the beginning of the day.
  - **Duration.** Think about how much time a given feedback conversation is likely to take if it goes well—and if it goes poorly.
  - **Physical location.** Choose a location that suits the needs of the conversation, ensures sufficient privacy, and minimizes interruptions and distractions.
  - **Proximity.** Think about the optimal proxiomity between you and the other person at that moment (e.g., authority vs. strong connection)
2. **Concentrate on the message**, you want to convey. Focus on facts, not assumptions. I recommend to consider the CORe method. Either way, take enough time to prepare your message.
3. **Manage emotions.** Express just enough emotion to engage the other person but not so much that you provoke a hostile ore defensive reaction, shut down the conversation, or damage the relationship.
4. **Rehearse and repeat.** As with any skill you're trying to master, experiment in low-risk situations before jumping into a high-stakes feedback conversation.
:::


## When to give feedback {visibility=hidden}

Offering feedback can be most useful in the following instances [@hbr2016feedback]:

- When good work, successful projects, and resourceful behavior deserve recognition
- When there is a high likelihood that a person's skills can be improved because there is an opportunity to use those skills again
- When the person is already expecting feedback, either because a feedback meeting has been scheduled in advance or because they know you have observed the behavior
- When a problem cannot be ignored because the person's behavior is negatively impacting a colleague, the team, or the organization

In other cases, giving feedback can have a detrimental effect on the situation. Avoid giving feedback in these circumstances:

- When you do not have all the information about a particular incident
- When the only feedback you can give involves factors that the recipient cannot easily change or control
- If the person needing the feedback appears to be very emotional or particularly vulnerable immediately after a difficult event - If you do not have the time or patience to give the feedback in a calm and thorough manner
- If the feedback is based on your personal preferences rather than the need for more effective behavior
- If you have not yet formulated a possible solution that will help the feedback recipient move forward

If you give positive feedback frequently, your negative feedback, if warranted, will seem more credible and less threatening.

## Pitfalls of positive feedback

:::html-hidden

:::

:::notes
Praise is supposed to make employees feel good and motivate them, but often it does just the opposite. @hbr2016feedback outlines three common problems and ways to avoid them:

1. **People don't trust the praise.** Often managers say something nice before they deliver unpleasant feedback. Invest in the relationship, don't use positive feedback to soften the blow.
2. **People resent it.** Managers also use positive feedback to overcome resistance to requests—positive feedback creates a sense of obligation, a social dept. Don't use feedback to get what you want.
3. **We praise the wrong things.** Praising intelligence, talent, and abilities backfires. It often causes people to stick to their comfort zones and get really defensive when they hit setbacks. Praise effort, not ability.
:::

## Gauging feedback {visibility=hidden}

Pay attention to the other person’s reaction to see your feedback is landing the right way.

. . . 

Respond accordingly:

:::{.incremental}
- **You encounter a strong emotion?**   
Acknowledge the emotion and avoid the temptation to let go of your challenge.
- **Not sure if you’re being heard?**   
Check to see if you’re understanding their reaction.
- **Are you being rebuffed?**   
Let the person know that you don't feel heard and that this is important.
:::

. . .

One effective way to keep tabs on how your feedback is landing is to ask your employees and colleagues to rate your feedback.

:::

:::notes
Making sure your team learns how to effectively give guidance to one another is essential to building a radically candid workplace.

- **Conflict resolution**: Commit your team members to challenging directly and caring personally by never allowing an employee to talk about one of their colleagues while they’re not present.
- **Public recognition of accomplishments and mistakes**: Create valuable learning opportunities by asking team members to get comfortable sharing their experiences.

A simple way to achieve public recognition is to award two prizes—such as stuffed animals or trophies—at weekly staff meetings. Any employee can nominate another for the achievement award by naming an accomplishment or outstanding work they have seen from their colleague during the week. Any employee can nominate themselves for the mistake award by stating a mistake or failure they have seen during the week.

## Sparkling collaboration {visibility=hidden}

![The getting stuff done wheel [@scott2019radical]](images/gsd-wheel.svg){#fig-gsd}

:::{.notes}

A key goal of a radically candid workplace is to build a highly collaborative climate and a team that works together to accomplish much more than anyone could individually [@scott2019radical]. The principle of personal caring is particularly important to a collaborative atmosphere for several reasons. First, it allows you to shift perspectives, that is, to incorporate someone else's way of thinking or acting into your own way of thinking or acting. Second, caring interrupts the self-serving mindset of focusing only on results.

Collaboration is a lengthy process that should involve every team member who is affected by the results. According to the *get stuff done* wheel [@scott2019radical], there are seven steps to effective collaboration: listen, clarify, discuss, decide, persuade, execute, and learn. You should move through the steps quickly so that collaboration is perceived as a rewarding task rather than a chore, but not skip any step—the success of each step builds on the success of the previous one.

#### Listen

Your job as a leader is to listen to every person on your team, with the goal of amplifying their voice.

You can apply **quiet listening** by inserting silence in your conversations in order to create space for the other person to speak. To be an effective quiet listener, focus on building conversations that make everyone feel comfortable. But be aware that people may waste their time trying to guess what you want, or present their own ideas as yours in meetings or conversations.

**Loud listening**, in contrast, is about saying things that will cause the other person to react or counter—this usually happens when you express a firm opinion and ask for a response. The advantage of this method is that no one wastes time trying to figure out what you think - it's very clear. Besides, this way you quickly get to the bottom of opposing points of view and logic holes.
You can encourage the confidence to challenge by stating your idea clearly, and then explicitly asking that the other person challenges your idea.

#### Clarify

Good thinking often needs clarification. It can be provided by brainstorming, when you quickly differentiate between good and bad ideas, or a 1:1 conversation, when you discuss the details without any judgment in a friendly environment.

It’s also crucial to remind you an your team that when presenting an idea, it’s the presenters responsibility to make sure everyone understands—not the other way around.

#### Debate

It must be a discussion where “individual egos and self-interest don’t get in the way of an objective quest for the best answer.” Debates take time and emotional energy, but are very productive.

- **Make sure ego doesn't get in the way of good ideas.** Set clear rules before debates, such as no interruptions or no criticism without an idea of your own. Reject anyone who puts forth an idea as "theirs" instead of involving the whole team, or who uses the opinions of absent people to support their opinions.
- **Expect disagreement.** A good debate doesn't happen when everyone at the table agrees - make it clear that you expect someone to look at the issue from a different perspective.
- It's your job to know your team members well enough to recognize when they're approaching that point, pause the debate, and decide when to resume it.
- **Know your audience.** Realize that there may be team members who don't like debates. Make the goals and expectations of the debate clear from the beginning to reduce discomfort with the debate.
- Set a deadline for your decision** Everyone must have the same expectations for when a decision will be made.
- **Don't make a decision just to end the debate.** Don't take work away from your team by making quick decisions.

#### Deciding

When it comes time to make a decision, make sure the right people are the decision-makers. Keep in mind that the most senior people—and you, as the boss—are often considered decision-makers, but they’re not necessarily the people with the best information. Your decision-makers should be those who are close to the facts surrounding a situation, and thus have the best possible information to make a decision.

#### Persuading

It might feel pointless to put effort into persuading people to go along with a decision once you’ve already made it, but it’s critical that everyone who will be helping you execute the decision is persuaded of its value—skipping this step leaves key people feeling unimportant and disconnected. Moreover, it is not enough to explain the mere logic: you will have to appeal to people’s emotions, as well as focus on your past accomplishments.

#### Executing

Do not get far away from the people executing the task. Be a part of the team.

#### Learn

It takes a huge amount of discipline to take a pause and step back to actually learn from your experience. However, it’s crucial to examine results and note the ways that the collaborative process could have gone more smoothly or been improved, because this is where growth happens.

# Challenges

You want to learn how to give (and receive) more helpful feedback? Here are three challenges that might help you along the way.

:::{.incremental}
- **Level 1:** Start a *feedback diary*. Note situations where you had to give someone praise or criticism. Write down what you said. Analyse if your feedback was radically candid. Try to reframe your non-radically candid praise or criticism so that it's more sincere and specific.
- **Level 2:** *Give feedback*, multiple times. Practice radical candor by applying the framework and the practices outlined in the [workbook](assets/radical-candor_workbook.pdf). Reflect on how the techniques have improved your conversations and relationships (including trust).
- **Level 3:** *Spread the word*. Teach your team at work, a group of friends or your family about the radical candor framework (e.g., using the [one-pager](assets/radical-candor-one-pager.pdf) and the [workbook](assets/radical-candor_workbook.pdf)). Introduce [*Whoops-a-Daisy & the Killer Whale*](assets/whoops-a-daisy-and-killer-whale.pdf) and practice it at least once a week over the upcoming weeks (remember the [CORE-model](assets/core-model.pdf)). Reflect on how the feedback culture and your relationships have changed.
