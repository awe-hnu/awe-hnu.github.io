# General remarks

The lecture will not be offered in winter term 2023/2024. Therefore, only the information on the repeat examination is provided here. 

The exam is similar to that in summer term 2023 with two exceptions: 

- You work on your own
- You are not required to develop a MVP, but to propose a technical solution that would work.

In order to solve the challenge, you will

- gather information about the practical context of the business challenge,
- research information about the topic (state of research and practice),
- identify and understand stakeholders that are affected by the problem as well as their needs,
- develop an innovative approach to tackle the problem,
- detail proposed the solution and create a running prototype,
- create an implementation plan,
- detail and reflect on the specific value creation mechanisms (e.g., considering privacy and traceability), and
- discuss lessons learnt, contributions and practical recommendations for action.

# Business challenge

Knowledge workers in many industries often struggle with an information overload that makes it difficult to extract key insights from an ever-growing pool of internal and externally available information, some of which is subject to strict confidentiality levels.

With the new possibilities provided by generative AI, various work processes can be simplified and made more efficient. Large language model (LLM) have the potential to revolutionize the way knowledge is summarized and facilitate efficient decision-making processes.

Your challenge is to recommend a solution to a LLM that can analyze and process a wide range of open and closed sources, leveraging either an existing (open source) LLM or building a new one. The objective is to generate high-quality responses to questions of knowledge workers, particularly sumamries to the current state of knowledge and answers to specific technical questions

## Key Questions

- How can your text generation model effectively analyze and summarize large volumes of diverse information from scientific articles, intranets, document management systems, CRM, Office workdspaces (e.g., SharePoint) and other relevant sources?
- How does your model ensure the accuracy and coherence of the generated summaries and articles, while maintaining the original meaning and context of the source material?
- What techniques or approaches does your model employ to overcome challenges such as information overload, ambiguity, and potential biases in the source data?

## Goals and outcome

The goal is to find innovative solutions that help to design such an interaction and interface between humans and machines.

For this purpose, a concept with proof-of-concept is to be submitted as well as the concept and outline for further implementation.

### Requirements

Technology
: The proposed solution should be a large language model (LLM) that can be integrated directly into the web browser. You can propose to utilize available resources, such as leveraging an existing (open source) LLM or building your own model.

Information aggregation
: The solution should focus on summarizing and aggregating information from various sources, both internal and external. Think of using APIs such as the google search API and APIs of document management systems and other internal enterprise information systems

Customization
: The knowledge base database should be customizable to enable flexible and personalized information management.

Privacy
: Show how the proposed solution meets data protection requirements and provide users with a secure and trusted environment.

References
: The solution should always transparently present the sources from which information was obtained to ensure the credibility and traceability of the data provided.

# Deliverables

You will deliver a __final presentation__ and a __seminar paper__.

- The __presentation__ gets to the heart of your idea (25% of the grade):
  - Short summary of your concept (i.e., elevator pitch)
  - Presentation of the prototype of your design
- The __seminar paper__ is a detailed documentation of your approach and of the artifact (75%):
  - An understanding of the problem and the needs of the stakeholders
  - Your approach to value creation incl. boundary conditions
  - Technical details of the solution that you propose
  - Your implementation and value-realization plan
  - Lessons learnt, contributions and practical recommendations for action

## Dates

The scheduled date for the presentations is **January 11, 2024 at 2pm**. The room will be announced. The slides must be submitted via E-Mail beforehand.

The deadline for the seminar paper is **January 23, 2024 at 8pm**. The seminar paper must be submitted in time via E-Mail

## Presentation

You have 15 minutes for the final presentation.

- Set-up the presentation as a convincing pitch.
- There are no formal requirements on the slides.
- Slides must be handed in as PDF via E-Mail.
- There will be a Q&A at the end.

### Evaluation criteria

An __exemplary presentation__ has the following characteristics 

- The student demonstrates excellent understanding of the problem, the approach, the solution and/or the implementation plan.
- The students is professional, extremely well prepared, and easily able to respond to even tough questions.
- Visual aids are well done and are used to make presentation more interesting and meaningful.
- The presentation is well organized with a beginning, middle and end. There is a strong organizing theme, with clear main ideas and transitions.
- The student speaks in a clear voice and show a flair for communicating with the audience.
- The students makes excellent use of the allowed time.
- The presentation slides are error free (spelling and language).

## Seminar paper

### Contents and structure

- __Abstract__: Gives a short elevator pitch of the approach that sums up your concept in a nutshell.

- __Introduction__: Provides an introduction that piques the reader's interest or curiosity for what is to come by indicating the main challenge.

- __Problem definition__: Outlines the specific problems that you have identified and that your solution is intended to address, as well as the stakeholders that will be affected and their needs. Also be clear about the consequences of failing to solve the challenge. You synthesise these into a concise problem statement. There is a need for reference to (scientific) literature here.

- __Approach__: Describe and discuss your approach to using IT to address the challenge and to create value for the organisation. You also need to consider alternatives to what you propose. Show why your approach is different from the alternatives and why it is more promising. 

- __Solution__: Provides a detailed description of the proposed solution, including technical details. In this section you should clearly show how the (characteristics of the) solution will support or tackle the business challenges outlined. Please also be specific in your description of the innovative nature of your solution.

- __Implementation__: This section covers how the organisation should and has implemented your solution, including a discussion of any potential hurdles that may need to be overcome. Also include how you plan to evaluate effectiveness.

- __Discussion__: Presents lessons learned, contributions and practical recommendations for action that go beyond the specific challenge. This involves looking at (scientific) literature.

- __Appendix__: Provides information that may help to gain an even better understanding of your solution. Also include the completed work assignment, the EKIPA submission form and a confirmation of submission (screenshot).

### Formal requirements

- Use the template offered [here](assets/BVC_Template.docx) 
- The paper should contain min. 10 pages of text per person (details see template)
