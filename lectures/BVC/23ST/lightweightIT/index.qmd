What is **generativity** and which are the **generative mechanisms**?
:::

## Generativity

Generativity refers to the basic idea that the observed complexity of a phenomenon^[E.g., phenomena such as biological diversity, social systems and language] can be traced back to some basic elements and their mechanisms for interaction [@phelan2001complexity].

. . .

**Generative technology** is defined as "a technologyâ€™s overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated
audiences" [@zittrain2006generative].

. . .

Generativity is an emergent **socio-technical phenomenon** [@bygstad2017generative]: the capacity to innovate is determined by the ongoing discourse between the actors on their interpretation and use of artifacts (i.e., generative relationships).

:::{.incremental}
- It is not an attribute of an object (such as technology), but rather the potential outcome of the interaction of different entities. 
- The outcome is dependent on, but not reducible to the entities (e.g., people and technologies) and their characteristics (e.g., knowledge and skills, flexibility)

## Generative mechanisms

![Generative mechanisms according to @henfridsson2013generative](images/mechanisms.svg){#fig-mechanisms}

:::{.notes}
The evolution of digital infrastructures can be described as the interplay between three self-reinforcing generative mechanisms [@henfridsson2013generative]:

Innovation
: The creative combination of social and technical elements in order to create new services

Adoption
: The recruitment of users through easy-to-use solutions, which allows more investments

Scaling
: The expansion of the network to include more partners to provide more services

A successful digital infrastructure is self-reinforcing, that is, it recursively feeds on itself.

What **differences** between heavyweight and lightweight IT?
:::

## Observations

Both are generative: heavyweight IT constitutes a powerful resource for developing new services; lightweight IT allows the non-IT specialist to deploy, use and benefit from IT to support their work processes.

. . .

|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Innovation**   | Emerge from the interactions between different IT specialists in co-operation with business managers.              | Emerge from the interactions of powerful users with IT product specialists.                                        |
| **Adoption**     | Tend to follow a waterfall model with implementation, training, and support from IT staff. Use is often mandatory. | Adoption tends to be voluntary and takes place in a more improvised process.                                       |
| **Scaling**      | May scale well or poorly, depending on its architecture and the skills of the IT staff.                            | Does not scale easily into other sites or domains, e.g. due to dependency on highly dedicated persons.             |

What is the **generative relationship** between heavyweight and lightweight IT?
:::


## Generative relationship

While heavyweight and lightweight IT has their internal generative capacities, the **interaction between Heavyweight IT and Lightweight IT** represents generates generative potential [@bygstad2017generative].

. . .

However, the knowledge regimes tend to be more incompatible than often assumed, because of their nested structures of technology and work practices.

. . .

Thus, generativity does not mean tight integration, rather heavyweight IT  and lightweight IT should be **loosely coupled** (i.e., technically and organizationally)

:::{.incremental}  
- Lightweight IT should support work processes successfully **before** it is integrated.
- Innovation is best served by different organisations developing heavyweight and lightweight IT.

## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Why are these knowledge regimes relevant for **BVC in contemporary organizations**?
:::

## Conclusion

Heavyweight IT is currently overloaded in most organisations, with rising cost, long backlogs and increasing complexity.

. . .

Adding lightweight IT into this situation will hardly make things easier. Rather, there is a need for a sensible division of labour between heavyweight and lightweight IT [@bygstad2017generative].

:::{.incremental}
- Heavyweight IT should concentrate on the stable elements of digital infrastructures
- Lightweight IT should provide the unstable and short-lived elements of the infrastructures
:::

. . .

For this division of labor to work, it is essential that the two knowledge regimes be **loosely coupled**.

# Homework

Please read @hund2021digital and answer the following questions:

- What constitutes digital innovation?
- How do digital infrastructures, digital platforms, digital ecosystems differ?
- What is the paradox of openness (e.g., value creation vs. value appropriation)?
- How do paradoxes relate to the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT?
