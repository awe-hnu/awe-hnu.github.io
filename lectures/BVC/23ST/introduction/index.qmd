## Necessity of definitions

![He should have defined what "fastest growing" (not) means ...](images/fastest_growing.png){#fig-growing}

:::{.notes}
To gain mutual understanding, core terms need to be defined. For this lecture, we need to‚Äîat least‚Äîfigure out what *IT* and *business value* means.
:::

## Definition {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Let's define some **core terms**.
:::

# IT and digital {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## IT *x*

The information systems (IS) literature categorizes IT resources into

:::{.incremental}
- **IT assets**, such as hardware, IT infrastructure, or software applications [@melville2004information]
- **IT capabilities**, such as IT skills or IT management abilities [@wade2004resource]
- **IT-enabled resources** are systems that are formed through relationships between IT assets and organizational resources, such as IT-enabled CRM [@wade2004resource]
:::

. . .

To create IT-enabled resources organizations need to integrate IT assets, IT capabilities and organizational resources in a way that it creates synergies.

## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Now what's the difference between **IT asset** and a **digital asset**?
:::

## Digital *x*

The term *digital* is increasingly used as **a qualifier to established concepts** (e.g., resource, capability, leadership).

. . .

This shift relates to changes regarding the contemporary settings of information technology use and its effects.

. . .

@piccoli2020digital defines some essential *digital* constructs as follows:

:::{.incremental}
- **Digital objects** are enduring, structured collections of elements, whose component parts include one or more bitstrings (e.g., a digital movie)
- **Digital resource** are a specific class of digital objects that are modular, encapsulate objects of value, and are accessible by way of a programmatic interface (e.g., Google Maps) involving
  - **Digital assets** are digital resources that encapsulate either nonmaterial digital objects or hybrid digital objects (e.g., user accounts)
  - **Digital capabilities** are digital resources that encapsulate repeatable patterns of organizational actions, yielding a capacity to undertake activities (e.g., calculating a route)

## From IT to digital resources

# Dynamic capabilities

The **resource-based view** supports that firms may achieve a competitive advantage based on their bundles of resources and capabilities [@peteraf2013elephant; @wade2004resource].

. . .

The **dynamic capabilities** (DC) view argues that firms have to evolve their resource and capability base in order to ensure a sustained competitive advantage [@peteraf2013elephant] ‚Äî two types of resources:

:::{.incremental}
- **ordinary or operational capabilities**, which allow firms to survive in the present by supporting existing operations
- **dynamic capabilities**, which are directed towards strategic change of ordinary capabilities and resources
:::

. . .

DCs govern the change of other organizational capabilities [@teece2014dynamic]. 

## IS and dynamic capabilities

# Value {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Dicussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
How can **value** created with IT (including AI) be defined?
:::

## IS business value

Value created by IT is‚Äîin a business context‚Äîusually referred to as IT/IS business value.

. . .

> IS business value is the impact of investments in particular IS assets on the multidimensional performance and capabilities of economic entities at various levels, complemented by the ultimate meaning of performance in the economic environment. *@schryen2013revisiting [p. 141]*

. . .

The ultimate meaning of performance refers to what is subsequently derived if the outcome is exploited, e.g.

:::{.incremental}
- impact on performance of a workflow management system: faster business processes
- the ultimate meaning: is dependent on the use of gained time **and** the extent to which competitors have speeded up their processes
:::

## Taxonomy of IS business value

![Taxonomy of IS business value types and examples according to @schryen2013revisiting](images/value.svg){#fig-value}

## Usage is the missing link between IT resources and impact

![The process model of IS value creation [@soh1995creates, p. 37]](images/process.svg){#fig-process}

:::{.notes}
IT assets need to be used in order to create any impact that, eventually, creates value.
:::

# Adoption and use

![Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [@venkatesh2003user]](images/utaut.svg){#fig-UTAUT}

:::{.notes}
The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) suggests that the actual use of technology is determined by behavioural intention. The perceived likelihood of adopting the technology is dependent on the direct effect of four key constructs, namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The effect of predictors is moderated by age, gender, experience and voluntariness of use
:::

## Efective use

![A model for effective use and its effect on performance [@burton2013use, p. 643]](images/effective-use.svg){#fig-effectiveUse}

:::{.notes}

:::{.small}
Key for @fig-effectiveUse: Solid arrows reflect primary paths; dashed arrows reflect secondary paths; boxed arrows reflect necessary causality (i.e., x enables but does not determine
y ). Bolding on ‚Äúuser,‚Äù ‚Äúsystem‚Äù and ‚Äútask‚Äù reflect the relative emphasis on each element of use (bold reflects more emphasis).
:::

The **Theory of Effective Use** defines effective use as ‚Äúusing a system in a way that helps attain the goals of using the system‚Äù [@burton2013use, p. 636] and conceptualizes it to consist of three dimensions: transparent interaction, representational fidelity, and informed action.

*Transparent interaction* is the extent to which a user is accessing the system‚Äôs representations unimpeded by its surface and physical structures.

*Representational fidelity* is the extent to which a user is obtaining representations from the system that faithfully reflect the domain being represented.

*Informed action* is the extent to which a user acts upon the faithful representations he or she obtains from the
system to improve his or her state.

# Homework

Please read @bygstad2017generative and answer the following questions:

- What is generativity and which are the generative meachsnisms?
- What are examples for lightweight and heavyweight IT with which you can explain the differences?
- What is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT?
