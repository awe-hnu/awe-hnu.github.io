## {background-image="images/dt-mindsets.jpg" .no-headline}

... based on these mindsets.
:::

## Human-centered {background-image="images/human-centered.jpg"}

**Understand people in context** — focus on how they do things and why, their physical and emotional needs, how they think about the world and what matters to them. 

## Radical collaboration {background-image="images/radical-collaboration.jpg"}

**Focus on diversity** — bring people with different backgrounds and experiences together to really understand a problem and evolve a solution.

## Culture of prototyping {background-image="images/prototyping.jpg"}

**Embrace experimentation** — prototyping helps you learn and think — taking action on an idea to understand it better, validating it or gaining evidence of the right solution.

## Show don't tell {background-image="images/show.jpg"}

**Illustrate your creative ideas** — communicate your vision through the use of experiences, visuals and stories.

## Be mindful of process {background-image="images/mindful.jpg"}

**Allow the design thinking process to guide your actions from start to finish** — always remember where you are in the design process, what you are hoping to accomplish and what you need to do next.

Design thinking is the way designers think[: the mental processes they use to design objects, services or systems, as distinct from the end result of elegant and useful products [[@dunne2006design]]{.smaller}.]{.fragment}
:::

## {background-color="#0333ff" .no-headline}

:::medium
Design thinking results from the nature of design work[: an interdisciplinary and projectbased work flow around “wicked” problems [[@dunne2006design]]{.smaller}.]{.fragment}
:::

:::incremental
- Solving complex problems
- Holistic perspective 
- Consideration of the interests of as many stakeholders as possible

:::medium
Designers can imagine the world from multiple perspectives – those of colleagues, clients, end users, and customers (current and prospective) [[@brown2008design]]{.smaller}.
:::

## Emphasize {background-color="#f4f4f4"}

:::medium
[We want to guide innovation efforts, ]{.fragment}
[find out everything about our customer or user ]{.fragment}
[and understand their problem]{.fragment}
[as well as uncover even latent needs and desires.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

We can use *Stakeholder Mapping* and *Why-How Laddering*.

### Emphasize — Stakeholder Mapping

Stakeholder mapping is the process of identifying a system of parties involved and interested in a particular outcome or product and their relations to one another.

. . .

Stakeholder maps create a solid foundation for user-centered design as they

:::incremental
- visualize and communicates the different parties involved and
- show hierarchies, key relationships, interests, problems, perspectives, etc.
:::

. . .

:::medium
Start with a **simple brainstorming** and organize your results in **a comprehensive map.**
:::

### Emphasize — Why-How Laddering

Why-how laddering is the process of fleshing out varying user needs and find a middle ground that’s both meaningful and actionable. 

:::incremental
- Asking “why” yields abstract statements, which are meaningful but often not actionable.
- Asking “how” yields specific statements, which are often easier to realize but less meaningful.
:::

. . .

:::medium
For each need, ladder up by asking *why* until you reach an abstract need. [Climb back down the ladder asking *how* to address the need.]{.fragment}
:::

## {background-color="#0333ff" .no-headline}

:::medium
If I had one hour to solve a problem, I would spend the first fifty-five minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking of the solutions.
:::

*Albert Einstein*

## Define  {background-color="#f4f4f4"}

:::medium
[We want to synthesize findings from the previous step, ]{.fragment}
[identify a **specific** and **meaningful** challenge to tackle, ]{.fragment}
[and create an **actionable** problem statement.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

We can use *Point of View (POV) Madlib* or *How Might We* to reframe our findings into a problem statement that can guide the hole design process.

. . .

For further tools see [bootcamp bootleg [@plattner2010d]](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/d-school/documents/01_GDTW-Files/bootcampbootleg2010.pdf)

### Define — POV Madlib

:::medium
`[USER]` needs to `[USER’S NEED]` because `[SURPRISING INSIGHT]`.
:::

. . .

Use a whiteboard or scratch paper to try out a number of options, playing with each variable and the 
combinations of them. 

. . .

The need and insight should flow from your unpacking and synthesis work. 

. . .

For example, instead of “A teenage girl needs more nutritious food because vitamins are vital to good health” 
try “A teenage girl with a bleak outlook needs to feel more socially accepted when eating healthy food, 
because in her hood a social risks is more dangerous than a health risk.” [@plattner2010d]
:::

### Define — How Might We (HMW)

:::medium
How might me `[ACTIONABLE PIECE]` for `[USER]` in order to `[NEED]`?
:::


. . .

1. Begin with your POV or problem statement (user and need)
2. Generate as many potential HMWs as you can
3. Group and theme HMWs
4. Vote and/or select the top HMW question to anchor your project

:::medium
The ideate phase represents a process of “going wide” in terms of concepts and outcomes — **it is a mode of
“flaring” rather than “focus.”**
:::

The goal of ideation is to explore a wide solution space both a large
quantity of ideas and a diversity among those ideas [@plattner2010d].

## Ideate  {background-color="#f4f4f4"}

:::medium
[We want to progress from defining problems to **exploring solutions**, ]{.fragment}
[spark creativity and innovation,]{.fragment}
[move **beyond the expected**,]{.fragment}
[and **exploit the multiplicity of perspectives** in your team.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

We can use different *brainstorming* and *brainwriting methods* to create and evaluate ideas.

### Ideate — Visual Brainstorming

Visual brainstorming uses **visualization as a tool to organize information**, capturing ideas by using something like a mindmap.

:::incremental
1. Write your problem statement in the middle.
2. Write all your ideas around it can connect it to the statement like in a mind map.
3. Continue ideation phase — Go back through all of your ideas and write down every thought you have in connection to them, how they maybe relate to each other, support them with visuals, expand upon them etc.
4. Go through each of your ideas again and try to determine elements that are sticking out and color them.
5. Organize your ideas. E.g., create a summary in form of a text document, a more organized mind map etc.

## Prototype  {background-color="#f4f4f4"}

:::medium
[We want to learn and eliminate ambiguity,]{.fragment}
[fail quickly and cheaply by testing a number of ideas,]{.fragment}
[refine solutions with users,]{.fragment}
[and inspire others by showing your vision.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

We can use multiple methods such as *paper prototyping*, *physical prototyping*, *click-dummies* or even tools like *LCDP*.

## Test  {background-color="#f4f4f4"}

:::medium
[We put our ideas into the appropriate context]{.fragment}
[to improve and understand the variables,]{.fragment}
[evaluate and refine the idea, and]{.fragment}
[receive constructive feedback]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

Methods such as *pitch*, *lean startup*, *surveys (quantitative and qualitative)*, *4-quadrant test* and many more are suitable for testing our ideas and prototypes.

# Aim of todays workshop {.headline-only .vertical-center background-color="black"}

## {.no-headline}

:::large
Narrow down the problem space of your challenge
:::

:::incremental
1. Iterate through the **emphasize**, **define**, and **ideate** phases.
2. Get answers to your questions (10.30 am).
3. Use the tools and templates presented or find others online.
4. Present your problem statement and initial ideas at the end of the day (3 pm; group by group).
5. Get initial feedback.
