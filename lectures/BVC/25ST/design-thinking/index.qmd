:::notes
The five principles of design thinking provide a framework for approaching complex problems with a human-centered mindset:

- **Human-centered**  
- **Collaborative**  
- **Experimental**  
- **Iterative**  
**Action-Oriented**  
Design thinking prioritizes concrete action over abstract analysis with a bias toward making and doing rather than just thinking and discussing. Rapid prototyping brings ideas into the physical world, real-world testing provides authentic feedback, and the ultimate goal is implementation and impact, not just insight.

These principles work together as an integrated system, encouraging teams to engage deeply with human needs, collaborate across boundaries, experiment boldly, refine solutions iteratively, and focus on tangible outcomes that truly meet user needs.
:::

## Human-centered {background-image="images/human-centered.jpg"}

**Understand people in context** — focus on how they do things and why, their physical and emotional needs, how they think about the world and what matters to them. 

:::notes
Design thinking places humans at the core of all problem-solving efforts. This means starting with deep empathy for the people you're designing for, understanding their needs, motivations, and pain points through observation and engagement. It values emotional and experiential insights as much as quantitative data and considers the full context of how people interact with products, services, and environments.
:::


## Collaborative {background-image="images/radical-collaboration.jpg"}

**Focus on diversity** — bring people with different backgrounds and experiences together to really understand a problem and evolve a solution.

:::notes
Design thinking embraces diverse perspectives and collective creativity. Cross-functional teams bring multiple viewpoints and expertise, while users and stakeholders become active participants in the design process. Power dynamics are flattened to encourage equal contribution, and the collective intelligence of the group is leveraged through structured collaboration.
:::

## Experimential {background-image="images/prototyping.jpg"}

**Embrace experimentation** — prototyping helps you learn and think — taking action on an idea to understand it better, validating it or gaining evidence of the right solution.

:::notes
Design thinking adopts a "build to think" approach where ideas are made tangible quickly through prototyping. Failure is reframed as learning through iteration, and solutions evolve through cycles of testing and refinement. The focus is on practical experimentation rather than theoretical perfection.
:::

## Iterative  {background-image="images/mindful.jpg"}

**Refine relentlessly** — circle back, reassess assumptions, and evolve your solution through continuous feedback and learning.

:::notes
Design thinking embraces a non-linear, cyclical approach where each phase informs and reshapes understanding of previous phases. Early failures guide subsequent iterations toward better solutions, and the process accepts that first solutions are rarely optimal. Continuous loops of feedback and improvement drive development.
:::

## Action-oriented  {background-image="images/show.jpg"}

**Make it real** - transform ideas into tangible prototypes that can be tested, experienced, and refined in the physical world.

:::notes
Design thinking prioritizes concrete action over abstract analysis with a bias toward making and doing rather than just thinking and discussing. Rapid prototyping brings ideas into the physical world, real-world testing provides authentic feedback, and the ultimate goal is implementation and impact, not just insight.

## {.no-headline}

:::medium
Design thinking results from the nature of design work[: an interdisciplinary and projectbased work flow around “wicked” problems.]{.fragment}
:::

:::incremental
- Solving complex problems
- Holistic perspective

:::medium
Designers can imagine the world from multiple perspectives – those of colleagues, clients, end users, and customers (current and prospective).

## Emphasize {background-color="#f4f4f4"}

:::medium
[We want to guide innovation efforts, ]{.fragment}
[find out everything about our customer or user ]{.fragment}
[and understand their problem]{.fragment}
[as well as uncover even latent needs and desires.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

We can use *Stakeholder Mapping* and *Why-How Laddering*.

### Emphasize — Stakeholder Mapping

Stakeholder mapping is the process of identifying a system of parties involved and interested in a particular outcome or product and their relations to one another.

. . .

Stakeholder maps create a solid foundation for user-centered design as they

:::incremental
- visualize and communicates the different parties involved and
- show hierarchies, key relationships, interests, problems, perspectives, etc.
:::

. . .

:::medium
Start with a **simple brainstorming** and organize your results in **a comprehensive map.**
:::

### Emphasize — Why-How Laddering

Why-How Laddering is a powerful technique used to explore both the deeper purpose (the "why") and practical implementation (the "how") of concepts or problems.

:::incremental
- **Moving up the ladder** (why questions):\
  When you ask "Why?" you move up to more abstract, purpose-driven thinking.
- **Moving down the ladder** (how questions):\
  When you ask "How?" you move down to more concrete, implementation-focused thinking.
:::

. . .

:::notes

Let's start with a middle statement: "We need to increase electric vehicle adoption."

Moving Up the Ladder (Why?)

- Why do we need to increase electric vehicle adoption?
  --> To reduce carbon emissions from transportation
- Why reduce carbon emissions?
  --> To mitigate climate change
- Why mitigate climate change?
  --> To ensure a sustainable future for humanity and ecosystems
Moving Down the Ladder (How?)

- How do we increase electric vehicle adoption?
  --> By making electric vehicles more affordable
- How do we make them more affordable?
  --> By reducing battery production costs
- How do we reduce battery production costs?
  --> By investing in battery technology research and scaling manufacturing
:::

. . .

For each need, ladder up by asking *why* until you reach an abstract need. [Climb back down the ladder asking *how* to address the need.]{.fragment}

. . .

This helps you to connect tactical actions to strategic purpose, [identify whether you're solving the right problem, ]{.fragment} [reveal assumptions that might need challenging]{.fragment}
[and provide multiple entry points for solution development.]{.fragment}

. . .

Example: We need to increase electric vehicle adoption.

If I had one hour to solve a problem, I would spend the first fifty-five minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking of the solutions.

*Albert Einstein*

## Define

:::medium
[We want to synthesize findings from the previous step, ]{.fragment}
[identify a **specific** and **meaningful** challenge to tackle, ]{.fragment}
[and create an **actionable** problem statement.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .


We can use a **Point of View (POV) Madlib** to synthesize our findings into a problem statement that defines the challenge[, and then transform this into **How Might We (HMW) questions** that open up opportunity spaces for ideation throughout the design process.]{.fragment}

. . .

For further tools see [bootcamp bootleg [@plattner2010d]](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/d-school/documents/01_GDTW-Files/bootcampbootleg2010.pdf)

### Define — POV Madlib

:::medium
`[USER]` needs to `[USER’S NEED]` because `[SURPRISING INSIGHT]`.
:::

. . .

Use a whiteboard or scratch paper to try out a number of options, playing with each variable and the 
combinations of them. 

. . .

The need and insight should flow from your unpacking and synthesis work. 

. . .

For example, instead of “A teenage girl needs more nutritious food because vitamins are vital to good health” 
try “A teenage girl with a bleak outlook needs to feel more socially accepted when eating healthy food, 
because in her hood a social risks is more dangerous than a health risk.” [@plattner2010d]
:::

### Define — How Might We (HMW)

:::medium
How might me `[ACTIONABLE PIECE]` for `[USER]` in order to `[NEED]`?
:::


. . .

The POV statement keeps you anchored to the core problem, while HMW questions open up thinking about potential solutions without losing sight of that problem.

. . .

1. Begin with your POV or problem statement (user and need)
2. Generate as many potential HMWs as you can
3. Group and theme HMWs
4. Vote and/or select the top HMW question to anchor your project

## {background-color="#0333ff" .no-headline}


:::medium
The ideate phase represents a process of “going wide” in terms of concepts and outcomes — **it is a mode of
“flaring” rather than “focus.”**
:::

The goal of ideation is to explore a wide solution space both a large
quantity of ideas and a diversity among those ideas [@plattner2010d].

## Ideate

:::medium
[We want to progress from defining problems to **exploring solutions**, ]{.fragment}
[spark creativity and innovation,]{.fragment}
[move **beyond the expected**,]{.fragment}
[and **exploit the multiplicity of perspectives** in your team.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

We can use different *brainstorming* and *brainwriting methods* to create and evaluate ideas.

### Ideate — Visual Brainstorming

Visual brainstorming uses **visualization as a tool to organize information**, capturing ideas by using something like a mindmap.

:::incremental
1. Write your problem statement in the middle.
2. Write all your ideas around it can connect it to the statement like in a mind map.
3. Continue ideation phase — go back through all of your ideas and write down every thought you have in connection to them, how they maybe relate to each other, support them with visuals, expand upon them etc.
4. Go through each of your ideas again and try to determine elements that are sticking out and color them.
5. Organize your ideas. E.g., create a summary in form of a text document, a more organized mind map etc.

## Prototype

:::medium
[We want to learn and eliminate ambiguity,]{.fragment}
[fail quickly and cheaply by testing a number of ideas,]{.fragment}
[refine solutions with users,]{.fragment}
[and inspire others by showing your vision.]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

We can use multiple methods such as *paper prototyping*, *physical prototyping*, *click-dummies* or even tools like *LCDP*.

## Test

:::medium
[We put our ideas into the appropriate context]{.fragment}
[to improve and understand the variables,]{.fragment}
[evaluate and refine the idea, and]{.fragment}
[receive constructive feedback]{.fragment}
:::

. . .

Methods such as *pitch*, *lean startup*, *surveys (quantitative and qualitative)*, *4-quadrant test* and many more are suitable for testing our ideas and prototypes.
