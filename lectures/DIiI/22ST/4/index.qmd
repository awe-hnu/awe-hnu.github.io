# Digital Twin {background-color="#0333ff" .vertical-center background-image="images/bg.jpeg"}

## Relevance

Digital twins are among the __most promising digital technologies__ being developed at present.

. . .

Digital twin technology provides capabilities to enable new business models and decision support systems by __incorporating data__, __information__, and __analytics capabilities__ as part of their service offerings

. . .

The concept has seen increasing interest in recent years in both academia and industry as indicated by the growth of publications, articles, and commercial marketing [@vanderhorn2021digital].

## Origins

The concept originates is nearly 15 years old and stems from the field of __product lifecylce management__ [@grieves2014digital].
 
. . .

The development of the concept was motivated shift from the predominantly paper-based and manual product data to a __digital model of the product__.

. . .

Focusing on connecting physical with digital systems, the digital twin has simlarities to concepts like __Cyber Physical Systems__ (CPS, control of production systems) and __Internet of Things__ (IoT, networking physical devices).

## Definition

:::{.notes}
The concept is constantly evolving as it expands to new industries and use cases. This has already led to a variety of definitions that threaten to blur the concept and may lead to ineffective implementations of the technology. 
:::

@vanderhorn2021digital propose a consolidated and generalized definition, with clearly established characteristics to distinguish what constitutes a digital twin and what does not. 

. . .

> A digital twin is "a virtual representation of a physical system (and its associated environment and processes) that is updated through the exchange of information between the physical and virtual systems." [@vanderhorn2021digital, p. 2]

. . .

The digital twin can be characterized by three primary components: 

:::{.incremental}
1. A physical reality,
2. a virtual representation, and 
3. interconnections that exchange information between the physical reality and virtual representation

## Components

![Digital Twin components and high-level processes based on @vanderhorn2021digital [p. 3]](images/components.svg){#fig-components}

::: {.notes}

The __physical reality__ that is to be represented by the digital twin can be decomposed into the __physical system__ (the system of interest), the __physical environment__ (where the physical system resides), and __physical processes__ (the mechanism by which the entities of the system under interest undergo changes in state) [@vanderhorn2021digital, p. 3].

The __virtual representation__ reflects the physical reality in an abstracted form in the virtual space. It can also be decomposed into the __virtual system__, the __virtual environment__, and the __virtual processes__. The abstractions of the physical reality often take the form of data models (data structures) and/or behavior models (mathematical or computational models). The virtual system, the virtual environment, and the virtual processes may contain multiple models of the physical counterparts at different levels of abstraction, which may or may not interact with each other [@vanderhorn2021digital, p. 4].

__Virtual processes__ play an essential role in the digital twin because they allow future states to be simulated This includes diagnosis and prognosis, design review, simulation and optimization, as well as "what-if" scenarios and sensitivity analyses. Applying virtual processes to the virtual system changes the virtual system states in a similar way that physical processes change the states in a physical system. This allows the user of the digital twin to hypothesize how the physical system would behave under similar physical processes. Thus, decisions can be made about what actions to take based on whether the simulated results match the desired results (e.g., predictive maintenance) [@vanderhorn2021digital, p. 4].

The physical-to-virtual connection via a data interconnection enables the process by which data collected from the physical reality is used to update the states maintained in the virtual representation. In general. It encompasses three steps [@vanderhorn2021digital, p. 5].:

1. The process of collecting the relevant information including the direct measuring of the physical reality,
2. interpreting the collected data to a form that is consistent with the level of abstraction and 
3. the updating process that uses the data to update the states of the virtual representation.

## Related concepts

The concept of digital twins bears similarities to __more traditional digital modeling approaches__ (e.g., computer-aided design (CAD) and product lifecycle management (PLM) tools).

. . .

However, __two key requirements__ for a digital twim that make it unique from traditional digital modeling approaches [@vanderhorn2021digital, p. 5].:

::: {.incremental}
1. A digital twin represents __a single instance of the system of interest__ not a class or fleet of systems  and
2. the digital twin updates its description of that system as it changes over time.
:::

## Implementation types

According to @vanderhorn2021digital, current industry implementations of digital twins can be generally grouped into three categories: 

::: {.incremental}
1. Digital twin component solutions (e.g., provided by Microsoft),
2. commercial off-the-shelf solutions (e.g., provided by OEMs like GE or Siemens), or
3. custom hybrid combinations.
:::

## Application fields

The growing consensus is that digital twin implementation will expand in many areas including __healthcare__ as promising field [@saracco2019digital].

. . .

Digital twin applications in healthcare and education imply that the concept will be __extended from artificial systems to people__.

. . .

The availability of millions of digital twins of people would make inference possible (e.g., by applying AI) and help practitioners gain knowledge
that could be used for __precision medicine and proactive health care__.

## Technology challenges

__Interoperability of digital models:__ there are different ways to create digital models, which hampers portability of models within and across different areas.

. . .

__Data interconnection:__ synchronization between the physical twin and its virtual representation requires pervasive and affordable communication channels (e.g., 5G or LoraWan).

. . .

__Extended digital twins:__ when the concept evolves to go beyond mirroring and shadowing a physical counterpart (e.g., by taking action on behalf of its physical counterparts), twins need to be open to data exchanges beyond the twin relationship, while preserving their identities and the association with their physical doubles.

. . .

__Data privacy, availability, and ownership__: data architecture must ensure that data is secure, portable, and can be controlled by the owner.
