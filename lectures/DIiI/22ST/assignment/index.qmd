# Task

During the semester you will be required to

::: {.incremental}
- gain insights into different application domains of digital innovation.
- research an organization in a specific industry, its challenges and how it addressed these by means of developing and introducing a digital innovation. 
- summarize your findings in a __seminar paper__ (case research study).
- develop the case study during the semester and will present defined interim results at defined dates (see timetable).
- receive and process feedback after each presentation.
- listen to the presentations of your fellow students and give constructive feedback.
:::

## Paper

The seminar paper is composed of following elements

::: {.notes}

- __Case summary__: A brief description of the case, the digital innovation and its impact on the organization and industry.

- __The Hook__: the beginning of the case that grabs the reader and generates interest in reading further. It should stimulate interest or curiosity in the reader for what is to come by suggesting the main challenge that is addressed by the digital innovation.

- __Industry__: here you characterize the industry and outline any information that is required or helpful for understanding the context of the innovation and the innovation process, e.g., relevant services or products, relevant frameworks like regulations, the primary factor that produces profit and key challenges addressed by the innovation described in this case study.

- __Company__: provides a decent overview of the company (organization, respectively) including the most salient features about the business and challenges faced that are related to the innovation.

- __Problem__: you outline and reflect the challenges which the digital innovation addresses (should address) and synthesize them into a concise problem statement.

- __Approach__: covers how the organization has developed and implemented the digital innovation and, if data is available, what challenges needed to be tackled.

- __Solution__: provides a rich description of the digital innovation, how it approaches the initially outlined problem statement and which effects it has generated on the organization (e.g., revenues) and the industry.

- __Discussion__: you comment, provide analysis and identify theories, or connect concepts or learning that help explain the mechanisms and effects of the innovation. 

- __Lessons learned__: you should make at least one firm recommendation for practitioners dealing with innovation management in the industry and explain why you have made this recommendation.

- __Appendix__: covers at least comprehensible information on how you did collect the research or this case study. You may also add any information that is helpful to gain a broader understanding of the case but is not necessary to follow your line of though in the main body of the text.
