# Introduction {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Relevance

Although online sales have increased significantly over the last decade, many consumers still report dissatisfaction and pursue frequent product returns due to products not meeting their needs [^1]. 

. . .

Particularly __uncertainty about the product__ causes these effects.

. . .

Modern visualization sytems are expected to attenuate the negative effects of unfamiliar experience goods on product returns and consumer satisfaction.

## Product uncertainty

__Product uncertainty__ is defined as the consumer‚Äôs difficulty in evaluating product attributes and predicting how a product will perform in the future [@arrow2004uncertainty].

. . .

Product uncertainty was shown to comprise __description uncertainty__ and __performance uncertainty__ (uncertainty about product quality) [@dimoka2012product].

. . .

Unlike traditional retail, customers are unable to physically inspect or evaluate products before making a purchase, resulting in greater performance uncertainty [@hong2014product].

. . .

However, it is not enough for a product to be described thoroughly and expected to perform well; the product must fit the consumer‚Äôs individual preferences.

## Product fit uncertainty

__Product fit uncertainty__ can be defined as the degree to which a consumer cannot assess whether a product‚Äôs attributes match her preference [@hong2014product].

. . .

The nature of product fit uncertainty is an __information problem__, reflecting consumers‚Äô difficulty in assessing if a product fits to their preferences.

. . .

__Product fit unvertainty__ was shown to have a more influential effect on product returns than did quality uncertainty [@hong2014product].

. . .

Particularly when concerned with __experience goods__ (i.e., products whose attributes are hard to transfer from
one party to another) with which consumers are not familiar (i.e., low product familiarity).

## Uncertainty reduction

Retailers could __lower information asymmetry__ by providing diagnostic product descriptions, or include credibility signals such as third-party product assurances, warranties, or customer reviews [@dimoka2012product].

. . . 

Reducing product fit uncertainty requires provision of opportunities for __direct product experiences__.

. . . 

However, these measures are __costly__ for retailers (additional shipping and handling costs) and/or are __not viable__ or __innaproriate__ in certain cases (e.g., customized products, personal care products or products that require assembly).

## Visualization systems

(Online) markets should use modern visualization systems to __reduce product fit uncertainty__, especially for experience goods [@hong2014product].

. . .

Such systems should

:::{.incremental}
- Sufficiently convey information on __experience attributes__ before purchase
- Enable customers to __identify their preference__ for experience attributes of a product before purchase
- Help consumers identify whether the experience attributes of a product __match their individual preferences__

# Augmented reality {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Definition

__Augmented reality__ (AR) is a technology that superimposes virtual objects onto a live view of physical environments, helping users visualize how these objects fit into their physical world [@tan2022augmented].

. . .

In contrast to AR, blending virtual elements into physical environments in real-time, __virtual reality__ (VR)
immerses users in a completely digital environment‚Äîusers are virtually transported to an artificial, simulated world, and are entirely shut out of their surroundings [@tan2022augmented].

## AR in retail

The unique capabilities of AR present marketers with new opportunities to engage customers and transform the brand experience [@tan2022augmented].

:::{.incremental}
- __Entertain__ customers by creating novel and engaging experiences 
- __Educate__ customers by deliver content and information in a visually appealing manner (e.g., by demonstrating key feautures, highlight relevant product information, and help to navigate in online stores)
- Help customers to __evaluate product fit__ (e.g., by visualizing products in their actual consumption contexts, increase customers' confidence, and accomodate wide product assortments and acommodation)
- __Enhance the postpurchase consumption experience__ (e.g., by offering new ways of enjoying products after purchase, delivering additional information while usage)
:::

## AR and product uncertainty

The __value of AR__ lies in its ability to both

:::{.incremental}
- help customers visually integrate virtual products into the __real-world environment__
- use bodily movements and physical actions to __control how products are presented__
:::

. . .

AR helps to __reduce product fit uncertainty__ as it enables customers to evaluate products as if they are interacting with the actual products [@tan2022augmented].
