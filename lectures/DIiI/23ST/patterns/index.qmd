# Data-oriented innovation

Besides competency-based, customer focused and externally-oriented approaches, managers can also take a __data-oriented approach__ to systematically tackle business innovation [@parmar2014new].

. . .

They identified __five distinct but overlapping patterns__ that answer following question:

. . .

>How can we create value for customers using data and analytic tools we own or could have access to?

## Pattern #1: Augmenting products to generate data

Because of advances in sensors, wireless communications, and big data, it is now feasible to __gather and crunch enormous amounts of data__.

. . .

Those data can be used to __improve the design, operation, maintenance, and repair of assets__ or to enhance how an activity is carried out.

. . . 

*Examples: SKF’s intelligent bearings, "pay-as-you-life" insurances*

#### Questions to be asked [@parmar2014driving]

- Which of the data relate to our products and their use?
- Which data do we now keep and which could we start keeping?
- What insights could be developed from the data?
- How could those insights provide new value to us, our customers, our suppliers, or our competitors?

## Pattern #2: Digitizing assets

Over the past two decades, the digitization of music, books, and videos has turned the entertainment industry on its head, introducing new models such as music and video streaming.

. . .

Digitization has typically __reduced distribution costs__, making the ability to efficiently transport physical inventory or secure low-cost warehouse locations less relevant.

. . .

Also regarding the operation of the digital services, company can realize __economies of scale__ and decrease __time-to-market__ by moving the business to the cloud.

. . . 

*Examples: Disney Plus, 3D printed spare parts.*

:::{.callout-note}
#### Questions to be asked [@parmar2014driving]

- Which of our assets are either wholly or essentially digital?
- How can we use the digital nature of assets to improve or augment their value?
- Do we have physical assets that could be turned into digital assets?

## Pattern #3: Combining data within and across industries

Data across supply chains and allied industries has been uncoordinated.

. . .

Big data, along with new IT standards and APIs allow __enhanced data integration__.

. . .

This enables __coordination across industries or sectors__ in new ways.

. . .

*Examples: smart cities, integrated supply chains, electronic health record.*

:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
#### Questions to be asked [@parmar2014driving]

- How might our data be combined with data held by others to create new value?
- Could we act as the catalyst for value creation by integrating data held by other players?
- Who might benefit from this integration and what business model might make it attractive to us or our collaborators?
:::

## Pattern #4: Trading data

The ability to __combine disparate data sets__ allows companies to develop a variety of new offerings for adjacent businesses.

. . .

Seemingly useless data could be a gold mine for some other business.

. . . 

__Data marketplaces__ facilitate the exchange of data.

. . .

*Examples: [Quandl](https://demo.quandl.com/monetize-data)*

:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
#### Questions to be asked [@parmar2014driving]

- How could our data be structured and analyzed to yield higher-value information?
- Is there value in the data to us internally, to current customers or to potential new customers?
- Is there value in the data to other industries?
:::
:::

## Pattern #5: Codifying a distinctive service capability

Companies that have perfected their business processes and systems can __standardize__ them and __sell__ them to other parties.

. . .

__Cloud computing__ has put such opportunities within close reach, as it allows companies to easily distribute software, simplify version control, and offer customers "pay as you go" pricing.

. . .

*Examples: AWS, Trumpf XETICS Lean*

:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
#### Questions to be asked [@parmar2014driving]

- Do we possess a distinctive capability that others would value?
- Is there a way to standardize this capability so that it could be broadly useful?
- Can we deliver this capability as a digital service?
- Who in our industry or other industries would find this capability attractive?
