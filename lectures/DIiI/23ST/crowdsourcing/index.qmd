# Introduction {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Relevance

To continually innovate, firms are __opening their boundaries__ to engage external expertise.

. . .

Instead of simply collaborating with a select few known external parties, firms are increasingly innovating using __crowdsourcing__.

. . .

A challenge faced by a firm are broadcasted in an __open call to individuals__ with relevant expertise outside the firm to become involved in solving the challenge (instead of asking internal research and development departments to solve the challenge) [@howe2006rise]

## Definition

> __Crowdsourcing__ is a type of participative online activity in which an individual, an institution, a non-profit organization, or company proposes to a group of individuals of varying knowledge, heterogeneity, and number, via a flexible open call [i.e., announcement], the voluntary undertaking of a task.   
[@arolas2012towards, p. 9]

. . .

Crowdsourcing can be applied to multiple tasks including __innovation__ (e.g., new products and services or changes to practices and processes)

. . . 

> We define innovation in a crowdsourcing context as the public generation of innovative solutions to a complex problem posed by the company
sponsoring the challenge call.
[@majchrzak2013towards, p. 258]


## Underlying theorem

The theoretical basis for crowdsourcing being generative of innovation is the value of __expertise diversity__. 

. . . 

:::{.incremental}
- External crowds are __more diverse__ in expertise and experiences than internal research and development units
- This implies the possibility of a __greater quantity and variety of ideas__
- Ideally, this leads to __more innovative ideas__
:::

. . .

There is empirical evidence that __a large diverse crowd of independent strangers__ performs better on certain types of challenges than a few experts (e.g., sports, stock forecasting) [@brabham2013crowdsourcing] 


# Participation architectures {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Definition

> Participation architectures refer to __sociotechnical systems design elements__ that encourage and integrate contributions made by participants to an open online forum focused on developing innovative solutions, such as open source software or Wikipedia  
[@majchrzak2013towards, p. 258].

. . .

These architectures vary along multiple dimensions, including:

:::{.incremental}
- __Production__: the way community conducts its production processes
- __Co-creation boundary management__: the process by which, through incentives and property rights management, only certain individuals will be encouraged to participate
:::

## Production

Crowdsourcing challenges may range from calls for __incremental innovation__ such as improvements in existing product lines (e.g., [Lego World Builder](https://worldbuilder.tongal.com/)) or to calls for __radical innovation__ such as developing entirely new service models (e.g., [OpenIDEO](https://www.openideo.com/)) [@majchrzak2013towards, p. 259].

. . .

__Design choices__ in the production dimensions include:

:::{.incremental}
- Type of contribution (text, images, etc.)
- Selection-process (e.g., up-voting possibility)
- Nature and type of discussions (e.g., moderated)
- Challenge journey (e.g., state gate journey)
:::

:::{.notes}

__Web-based crowdsourcing architectures__ usually require participants to submit their ideas in the form of text (as in the IBM Innovation Jam discussion forums) or in the form of product design specifications (as in Lego Mindstorms). Posting the idea opens a __discussion thread__. Subsequent participants can then either contribute by adding comments to a posted idea, or post their own idea to start a new discussion thread. In the various crowdsourcing experiences, there may be little discussion of an idea (as in Heineken's Beer Challenge) or there may be many comments and responses (as in Threadless). Because the architectures generally require that an idea be posted to start a discussion (rather than posting facts or some other generative response), the discussion is usually focused on refining a posted idea and rarely on recombining existing posts into new ideas. As a result, ideas are rarely significantly changed by combination and recombination. These discussions can be moderated or not [@majchrzak2013towards, p. 259].

Another variation of the architecture for innovation production in crowdsourcing is the way the __crowd votes__: In many architectures, the crowd is asked to vote on each idea submitted, which accelarates the cycle times. Without voting on the crowd's most preferred ideas, it would take a sponsoring organization countless hours to review each idea, while the crowd voting __speeds up the evaluation of experimental ideas__ [@majchrzak2013towards, p. 259].

:::

## Co-creation boundary management

Co-creation boundary management refers to the basis by which individuals with certain identities are __given preference__ over others when __encouraging participation__ including incentive structures and intellectual property protections [@jarvenpaa2011boundary].

. . .
 
@majchrzak2013towards [p. 259] distinguish between __outcome-based crowdsourcing__ and __contribution-based crowdsourcing__ architectures.

:::{.notes}
- In __outcome-based crowdsourcing__ the best idea wins and its contributor is awarded with an extrinsic prize. The crowdsourcing effort is then usually referred to as an *innovation tournament* or *innovation contest* or *idea tournament*.

- In __contribution-based crowdsourcing__, incentives are given for the process by which the crowd participates in the crowdsourcing challenge (e.g., the number of comments on others' ideas). Depending on the type of production process being promoted, the sponsoring organization may be particularly concerned with encouraging sufficient crowd activity on the crowdsourcing platform. In this case, incentives can be created based on the number of published contributions. These incentives may be for the best contributor in terms of number of posts or number of ideas posted.
:::

. . .

In for-profit crowdsourcing projects, both types usually include that the members __exchange IP for the opportunity to win a prize__.

:::{.notes}
Participants are often informed that, when the sponsor is a for-profit entity and the crowd is the general public, the sponsoring company owns all intellectual rights. Essentially, members of the crowd are giving up their intellectual property rights in exchange for the opportunity to win the prizes. In contrast, with ‚Äò‚Äòcaptive‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòclosed‚Äô‚Äô communities in which individuals have been specially selected to be a member of the community because of their interests and expertise, winners often retain some intellectual property @majchrzak2013towards].

# Challenges {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Co-creation discussions

__Collaborative discourse__ that leads to generative co-creation is a foundational requirement for innovation.

. . .

__Generative co-creation__ is defined as a series of interactions in which different assumptions and perspectives are discussed in order to surface and resolve critical trade offs that were unresolvable previously [@majchrzak2013towards, p. 265].

. . . 

According to @majchrzak2013towards, following tensions need to be addressed:

:::{.incremental}
- Simultaneous __encouragement__ of competition and collaboration
- Idea evolution takes __time__, but crowd members spend little time
- Creative abrasion requires __familiarity__ with collaborators; yet crowd consists of strangers
:::


## Competition vs. collaboration

Options to manage the tension of simultaneously encouraging competition and collaboration include [@majchrzak2013towards]:

:::{.incremental}
- Separation of __idea generation__ and __idea evolution__ (e.g., emphasizing re-combination of ideas)
- Offering rewards to participants based __both__ on how well they __compete__ on ideas, and __cooperate__ on contributing to others‚Äô ideas
- Providing __multi-valenced rewards__ (e.g., earning, prizes, career opportunities, self-marketing, appreciation from peers, and appreciation by the sponsoring organization)
:::

## Spending enough time


Making not only the idea generation but also __the knowledge evolution__ transparent to the crowd helps increase the time crowd members spend on idea evolution [@majchrzak2013towards]:

:::{.incremental}
- __Keeping the crowd informed__ of gaps in knowledge that need to be filled (e.g., allowing for a quick skim to identify recent changes and then jump into a discussion to make the next contribution)
- Keeping the __focus on evolving comprehensive solutions__, rather than generating more ideas or point solutions
- Increasing the __diversity of expertise__ and the __passion for the topic__
:::

## Needed familiarity

Options for managing the need for familiarity with collaborators for creative abrasion include [@majchrzak2013towards]:

- Offering a __front stage__ for minimal confrontation. Here ideas are posted or knowledge evolution is displayed
- Tools specifically geared to discuss disagreements are provided at the __back stage__

:::{.notes}
Having front and back stages may help to manage the creative abrasion tension by showing the need for creativity as well as progress on the front stage, while having a back stage where individuals can engage in the creative abrasive process. In this way, participants can be encouraged to engage each other in task-related discussions and deliberations without discouraging others. The creative results are then displayed in the front page section for the crowd to absorb and continue evolving [@majchrzak2013towards, p. 268].

In a Wikipedia context, for example, the article being co-created is in the front stage, where the Talk Page (i.e., dicussion forums) is the back stage.
