# Innovation in the digital age

Digital technologies have __lowered the cost__ of producing and disseminating knowledge. 

. . .

This induces four key __changes in innovation practices and outcomes__ across industries [@OECD2019digitalInnovation]:

:::{.incremental}
- __Data__ are becoming a key input for innovation
- A focus on __service innovation__ enabled by digital technologies (i.e., servitisation)
- __Innovation cycles__ are accelerating
- __Collaboration__ is becoming a more critical component in innovation
:::


## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
How does data change innovation practices and outcomes?
:::

## Data as core input

Data from a variety of sources (e.g., consumer behavior, business processes, research) are a __key driver__ of innovation.

:::{.notes}
The exponential growth of __generation of data__ of various kinds and the new ways of __collecting__ and __utilizing__ such data have made it a key input for innovation in all sectors of the economy. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is contributing to a steady increase in data generation as more devices and activities are connected. The use of AI, including machine learning, further increases the expected value of data [@OECD2019digitalInnovation, p. 27].

Data and data analytics provide opportunities for research and driving innovation, including in the following ways.
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Changing the __research process__  
(e.g., large-scale computerized experiments and ML for vaccine development)
- Enabling __new products__, services and business models  
(e.g., on-demand-mobility services)
- Enhancing __customization__  
(e.g., marketing, precision medicine)
- Guiding __process optimization__  
(e.g., real-time supply chain systems, traceability)
:::

## Servitisation

Digital technologies are leading to a __blurring of the boundaries__ between services and manufacturing

:::{.notes}
As data and software are replacing many physical components and products, opportunities arise in particular for the creation of entirely new digitally enabled services (e.g., predictive maintenance, on-demand transportation). New digital technologies have also propelled the expansion of sharing or renting as service models that replace selling (e.g., of equipment), and the customization of products as a service [@OECD2019digitalInnovation, p. 29].

Also, rising competitive pressures linked to the entry of digital players in traditional sectors and changing consumer demands, are pushing incumbent manufacturing firms to offer new digitally enabled services, while allowing service providers to improve their offerings [@OECD2019digitalInnovation, p. 30].

Digital technologies like data analytics capabilities, augmented and virtual reality, and IoT provide opportunities for new services and service innovations, including in the following ways.
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Enabling new __complementary services__ (i.e., servitisation of manufacturing due, e.g., real-time monitoring of products' status, performance and usage and growing data analytics capabilities)
- Enhancing the __service experience__ (e.g., personalized promotions, digital mirrors, "pay as you live")
:::


## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
How can digital technologies accelerate innovation cycles?
:::

## Faster innovation cycles

Digital technologies offer new opportunities to experimentation and version and thus allow accelerating innovation cycles.

:::{.incremental}
- Accelerating __design, prototyping and testing__ (e.g., 3D printing, digital twin)
- Allowing __experimenting__ with (not fully finished) products and services on the market (e.g., public beta, lean-start-up method)
- Enabling regular __upgrading and versioning__ (e.g., "over the air" updates)
- Increasing the __flexibility of manufacturing__, enabling small series production at low cost, and allowing for higher __customization__ (e.g., Industry 4.0. 3D printing, software-based customization)
:::

## Collaborative innovation

Innovation ecosystems are becoming more and more open and diverse.

:::{.notes}
Companies are increasingly interacting with research institutions and businesses. The reasons for this are complex. First, such collaborations provide access to a richer pool of expertise and skills that complement their own competencies. Access to talent is expected to spur creativity and enable innovation in new areas. Second, such collaborations enable the sharing of costs and risks of uncertain investments in digital innovation. Companies often face multiple potential research and technology development paths that require substantial investments with uncertain outcomes to master (e.g., the vaccine development collaborations during the Covid 19 pandemic). Finally, lower communication and collbaboration costs enable greater interaction among actors involved in innovation, regardless of their location [@OECD2019digitalInnovation, p. 32].

These collaborations take different forms, including the following.
:::

:::{.incremental}
- __Data sharing__ (e.g., sharing data with supply chain partners and retailers)
- __Business incubation__ (e.g., accelerator programs)
- __Open innovation__ (involves collaboration with other businesses, public research and university partners, digitalization reduced the costs for open innovation partnerships)
- __Platforms__ (e.g., open software platforms) and other __innovation ecosystems__ (e.g., crowdsourcing platforms)
- __Corporate ventures__ capital investments and acquisitions
- __In-house collaborations__ (e.g., digital innovation labs or innovation garages)
:::
 
# Differences across sectors

Since industries significantly differ in their products and processes, their structures, and in how they engage in innovation, the approaches and outcomes to __digital innovation__ are unlikely to be the same. 

:::{.notes}
For example, end products in primary sectors such as the food industry or mining remain largely unchanged, while the media, music and games industries have completely digitized their offerings in recent decades and healthcare innovations draw significantly on advances in AI and biotechnology. Production and innovation processes have also been transformed by digital technologies, but in different ways: while robots are used extensively in the automotive industry to automate processes, automation is still in its infancy in sectors such as agriculture and retail [@OECD2019digitalInnovation, p. 45].
:::

. . .

According to @OECD2019digitalInnovation [p. 42ff] three main dimensions shape the differences:

:::{.incremental}
- The scope of __opportunities for digital innovation__
- The __types of data needed__ for innovation and related challenges for exploration and exploitation
- The conditions for __digital technology adoption and diffusion__
:::

## Opportunities

Depending on the sectorial characteristics, digital technologies may offer different opportunities for 

:::{.incremental}
- creating digitalized __products and services__,
- digitalizing __business processes__, and
- establishing new __digitally enabled business models__.
:::


## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Why do **opportunities** to create digitalized products and services **differ between sectors**?
:::

## Digitalized offerings

:::{.notes}
Digital technologies have the potential to create new or expand existing goods and services with digital features.
:::

![Opportunities to digitalize end products based on @OECD2019digitalInnovation [p. 47]](images/opportunities.svg){#fig-opportunities}

---

## Digitalized processes

Digital technologies offer opportunities for

:::{.incremental}
- __automation__ of business processes,
- __interconnected supply chains__ to increase transparency and agility, and
- __improved interactions__ with the consumer
:::

## Digital business models

In some cases/sectors new business models largely __displace__ incumbent ones (e.g., online booking platforms)

. . .

In other sectors they may __co-exist__ (e.g., combined brick-and-mortar and online shopping experiences)


## Examples

Let's look at __three distinct sectors__ and how digital innovation is changing these.

:::{.incremental}
- __Agri-food__ (production, processing, distribution and commercialization of food)
- __Automotive__ (manufacturing, distribution, and commercialization of vehicles, as well as after-sales activities)
- __Retail__ (selling consumer goods or services to ultimate consumers, both online and at physical stores including transportation of products from warehouses to stores and directly to customers)
:::

### Agri-food sector

Digital innovations in the agri-food sector focus on production processes and supply chain management [@OECD2019digitalInnovation, p. 44].

:::{.incremental}
- __Precision farming__ ‚Äî using digital technologies to optimize use of inputs for crops to grow optimally (e.g., managing inputs like water, fertilizers, pesticides)
- Introduction of __robots__ (e.g., for fruit-picking, harvesting and milking)
- __Big data analytics & AI__ to inform farm management decision-making [@wolfert2017big]
- Potential to __trace products__ along supply chains using IoT and blockchain technology [@shahid2020blockchain]

## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::{.large}
Why does the **diffusion of digital innovations** vary between sectors?
:::

# Diffusion trends

The level of digital technology adoption varies across sectors [@calvino2018taxonomy].

. . . 

Differences in adoption rates stem from variances in sectors' capabilities and incentives to adopt new technologies [@andrews2018digital]. 

. . .

Key factors influencing adoption include

:::{.incremental}
- Individual and organizational capabilities
- Presence of market disruptors (e.g., digital start-ups or tech firms)
- Sectoral characteristics (e.g., access to relevant infrastructure)
- Consumer demands and attitudes towards change
:::

:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
### Sectoral characteristics [@OECD2019digitalInnovation]

__Distribution of firm size and sectoral fragmentation__: large firms have usually the resources to adopt new technology, while small firms are more risk-averse. On the other hand, large firms can suffer from inertia, rigid hierarchical structures, and legacy systems that may hamper the diffusion of digital innovations. Technology diffusion may also be slower in highly fragmented sectors.

__Access to relevant infrastructure__: this might be a challenge for sectors and firms located in more remote or rural areas.

__Complexity of supply chains__: tight connections among firms along the supply chains also influence dynamics of innovation diffusion ‚Äî suppliers may adjust more rapidly upon requests from upstream partners.

__Level of public investments__: the public sector is the main (direct or indirect) provider of services such as education and healthcare. Thus, the level of diffusion depends on the capacity of the pbulic sector to invest in these areas.
