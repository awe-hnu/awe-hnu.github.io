# Task

During the semester you will be required to

:::incremental
- gain insights into **different application domains** of digital innovation;
- research an organization in a specific industry, its challenges and how it addressed these by means of developing and introducing a digital innovation;
- **present** defined interim results at defined dates (see [timetable](../admin/#schedule));
- summarize your findings in a __seminar paper__ (case research study);
- receive and process feedback after each presentation; and
- listen to the presentations of your fellow students and give constructive feedback.
:::

## Paper

The seminar paper is composed of following elements (you can change order of chapters such as approach and solution if it supports to your story-line)

::: {.notes}

- __Case summary__: A brief description of the case, the digital innovation and its impact on the organization and industry (i.e., abstract).

- __Introduction__: the beginning of the case that grabs the reader and generates interest in reading further. It should stimulate interest or curiosity in the reader for what is to come by suggesting the main challenge that is addressed by the digital innovation.

- __Industry__: here you characterize the industry and outline any information that is required or helpful for understanding the context of the innovation and the innovation process, e.g., relevant services or products, relevant frameworks like regulations, the primary factor that produces profit ... portrait the industry in a way, that the problem statement can be comprehensively derived.

- __Company__: provides a decent overview of the company (organization, respectively) including the most salient features about the business and challenges faced that are related to the innovation.

- __Problem__: you outline and reflect the challenges which the digital innovation addresses (should address) and synthesize them into a concise problem statement.

- __Approach__: covers how the organization has developed and implemented the digital innovation and, if data is available, what challenges needed to be tackled.

- __Solution__: provides a rich description of the digital innovation, how it approaches the initially outlined problem statement and which effects it has generated on the organization (e.g., revenues) and the industry.

- __Discussion__: you comment, provide analysis and identify theories, or connect concepts or learning that help explain the mechanisms and effects of the innovation. 

- __Lessons learned__: you should make at least one firm recommendation for practitioners dealing with innovation management in the industry and explain why you have made this recommendation.

- __Appendix__: covers comprehensible information on how you did collect the research or this case study. You may also add any information that is helpful to gain a broader understanding of the case but is not necessary to follow your line of though in the main body of the text.

# Evaluation criteria {.headline-only}

## Passing criteria

The following are **threshold requirements**. Deficiencies in these areas will result in a failing grade regardless of content quality.

:::incremental
- The writing is clear, easy to read, and largely free of errors
- All formal requirements are met (template, page limits, formatting)
- Sources are properly cited and referenced
- The case includes at least one documented primary data source
- An AI Declaration is provided
:::

## Grading criteria


The grade is determined by the following components and their respective weights. The passing criteria above must be met for the grading criteria to be applied.

| Component                  | Weight | Key characteristics                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Case study**             | 50%    | Compelling intro; industry well characterized; company and problem fully elaborated; DI, process and industry relations well outlined; theory-based discussion; actionable recommendations |
| **Comparative reflection** | 20%    | Meaningful comparison with ≥2 peer cases; contextual differences and commonalities identified; transferable insights derived                                                               |
| **Process documentation**  | 20%    | Transparent evolution of understanding; reflection on feedback integration; key turning points identified                                                                                  |
| **Data quality**           | 10%    | Primary data adds genuine depth beyond publicly available information; data collection is methodologically sound and well documented                                                       |

## Bonus points

:::large
You can earn **bonus points**.[^Bonus]
:::

. . .

The bonus points are assigned based on continuity and quality of your contributions to the exercises and discussions with our guest speakers.

. . .

The bonus points can improve your performance by up to two grade increments (up to .7).

[^Bonus]: The bonus points are only taken into account when determining the module grade if it results in a better module grade and the original module grade is at least "4.0". Participation in the bonus course is voluntary. For details, please see the general examination regulations of the HNU (*APO*).

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum.
