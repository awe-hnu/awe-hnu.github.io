:::notes
This course will be taught using **traditional synchronous lectures** with many guest speakers. The focus of the live sessions is on discussing real world cases and developing theoretically-based explanations. In addition, you will do an original research on a digital innovation case on your own (see [assignment](../assignment/)).

It is very important that you prepare yourself for every session. You either need to work through teaching materials in advance or prepare to present the deliverable of your own case (see @tbl-schedule).
