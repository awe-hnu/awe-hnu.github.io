What does agility in a **general business context** mean? 
:::

## What is agile?

The term agility has been increasingly used in management literature since the late 20th century [@harraf2015organizational].

. . .

Around the same time, agile approaches gained prominence in software development, leading to the publication of the agile manifesto in 2001 [@beck2001agile].

. . .

Over the past two decades, organizational theorists have focused extensively on how agile performance enable companies to successfully adapt to rapidly changing and unpredictably disruptive environments [see e.g., @adler1999flexibility; @grewal2001building; @judge1991antecedents; @smith2011toward].

## Common themes

Several common themes in literature @harraf2015organizational have identified:

:::{.incremental}
1. A specific set of **organizational sense-response actions** that are typical for organizations operating in an environment characterized by turbulence, unpredictability, and rapid change (i.e., VUCA environments).
2. Agile organizational sense-response actions can be specified using a bi-dimensional concept of **magnitude of variety change**[^variety] (flexibility) and **rate of generating variety change**[^rate] (speed).
3. Agility is a **function of environmental conditions** (the industry), exhibiting varying levels of market turbulence, competitive intensity, and customer need heterogeneity.
4. The likelihood of observing a **positive effect of agility on performance** (e.g., efficiency, innovativeness) is greater in fast-changing environments.
:::

[^variety]: Magnitude of variety change includes the decision alternatives generated, different strategies deployed, new products and lines introduced, non-routine tasks added to the repertoire of routine tasks, and product variations offered.
[^rate]: Rate of variety change—defines the temporality of change and relates to the change in variety per unit of time.


## Towards a definition

Literature suggests that organizational agility can neither be reduced to a singular dimension nor is it appropriately calibrated in absolute terms. 

. . .

In terms of the four key points outlined before, agility can be formally defined as follows:

. . .

> Organizational agility is the ability of a firm to sense and respond to the environment by intentionally changing (1) magnitude of variety and/or (2) the rate at which it generates this variety relative to its competitors. *[@harraf2015organizational]*

## Visualization

:::{.notes}

According to @harraf2015organizational four classes of organizations with different competitive strengths and capacity regions for agility can be identified as *innovators*, *disrupters*, *adapters*, and *indifferents.*

**Innovators** identify their competitive strength in being able to identify new opportunities and strive for the ability to make movements that involve a greater degree of variety change, but at the expense of a lower or constant rate of change. They are able to respond to unfamiliar changes in the environment with great diversity.

**Adapters** their competitive advantage in generating a higher pace of variety change while maintaining a lower or constant level of variety change. They have a constant willingness to address change quickly, proactively or reactively.

**Disrupters** redefine market competition by developing capacity to overcome trade-offs by generating both higher magnitude 
and greater rate variety change. These organizations explore and exploit opportunities for innovation and competitive performance—they move the efficiency/flexibility tradeoff to simultaneously pursue both.

**Indifferents** do not engage in agile based competition in the industry and they do not anticipate the magnitude or rate 
of variety change to be important properties of their strategic responses.

## Ambidexterity and agility

In general, **ambidexterity** refers to the combination of both incremental, more efficiency-oriented innovation (i.e., exploitation) and radical, novelty-oriented innovation practices (i.e., exploration) [@clauss2021organizational].

. . .

**Operational ambidexterity** "relates to a firm’s dual capacity to simultaneously pursue not only the implementation of disruptive ideas [... ] but also the enhancement of the firm’s current operational speed, reliability, and cost" [@lee2015does, p. 401].

. . .

IT ambidexterity relates to "the ability of firms to simultaneously explore new IT resources and practices (IT exploration) as well as exploit their current IT resources and practices (IT exploitation)" [@lee2015does, p. 398]. 

. . .

@lee2015does shows that IT ambidexterity enables operational ambidexterity, which enhances organizational agility.

## IT competences and digital options

**IT competence** describes a company's ability to gernate IT-related innovations by means of available IT resources and the ability to translate these resources into strategic **digital options** [@sambamurthy2003shaping].

. . .

**Digital options** are a set of IT-enabled capabilities in the form of digitized enterprise work processes and knowledge systems (e.g., digital process capital[^dpc] and digital knowledge capital[^dkc]) [@sambamurthy2003shaping].

. . .

IT competences and digital options represent **organizational capabilities** that are developed over time through a series of linked strategic decisions about investments in IT.

. . .

These **organizational capabilities** enable organizational agility.

[^dpc]: Digital process capital is the IT-enabled inter- and intra-organizational workp rocesses for automating, informating, and integrating activities (e.g., customer akquisition, order fulfillment, supply chain, product innovation, and manufacturing flow) and creating a seamless flow of information [@sambamurthy2003shaping, p. 247].
[^dkc]: Digitized knowledge capital is the IT enabled repository of knowledge and the systems of interaction among organizational members to generate knowledge sharing of expertise and perspectives  [@sambamurthy2003shaping, p. 247].

## Types of agility

Types of agility supported by IT as identified by @sambamurthy2003shaping:

:::{.incremental}
- **Customer**: Ability to co-op customers in exploration and exploitation of innovation opportunities (source, co-creators, testers).
- **Partnering**: Ability to leverage assets, knowledge, and competencies of suppliers, distributors, contract manufactors and logistics providers in the exploration and exploitation of innovation opportunities.
- **Operational**: Ability to accomplish speed, accuracy, and cost economy in the exploitation of innovation opportunities.
:::

## Agile IT project management

The approach to IT project management defines how IT resources are developed, orchestrated, and, best case, translated into strategic digital options.

. . .

The foundation of methods to agile IT project management is the agile manifesto [@beck2001agile], which defines following key values and principles:

:::{.incremental}
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
- Working software over comprehensive documentation 
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation 
- Responding to change over following a plan
:::

. . .

These key values and principles aim to enable organizations to **better deal with rapid changes** in customer demands, markets and technology by, e.g., decreasing lead-time, increasing change rate, and the degree of variety change.

# Agile at scale {.vertical-center .headline-only background-color="#14336a"}

## Introduction

Agile project management methods were originally designed for use in small, single-team projects [@boehm2005management].

. . .

Compared to small projects and teams, large projects and organizations require additional coordination (i.e., inter-team coordination)

. . .

In addition, adopting agile at scale often requires **tradeoffs** as interacting with organizational units that ar eoften non-agile in nature is required (e.g., HR) and/or a change of the entire **organizational culture** [@misra2010identifying] .

. . .

Another key challenge is that management must move away from traditional hierarchical models (e.g., lifecycle-based) to autonomous, iterative models (e.g., feature-based), which requires a **change of mindset**.

## Definition

@dikert2016challenges define large-scale as software development organizations with 50 or more employees or at least six teams.

. . .

All people do not need to be developers, but must belong to the same organization and develop a common product or project, and thus have a need to collaborate.

. . .

This definition includes both software development companies and as the parts of larger (non-software) organizations that develop software (i.e., the application development unit within corporate IT).

## Transformation challenges

@dikert2016challenges identified challenges in nine cateogires for large-scale agile transformations

:::{.incremental}
- **Resistance to change** (e.g., general resistance, management resistance)
- **Lack of investment** (e.g., lack of coaching, training, adapting physical spaces)
- **Difficulties of implementation** (e.g., lack of guidance, poor customization)
- **Coordination challenges in multi-team environment** (e.g., interfacing, autonomous team model, technical consistency)
- **Different approaches** (e.g., different interpretations, old and new side by side)
- **Hierarchical management and organizational boundaries** (e.g., silos kept, old-styled management)
- **Requirements engineering challenges** (e.g., gap between long and short-term planning)
- **Quality assurance challenges** (e.g., lack of automated testing)
- **Integrating non-development functions** (e.g., adjusting to incremental delivery pace)
:::

## Frameworks

To adress challenges to adopting agile methods in large, more traditional organizations, several agile scaling opportunities have been created [@dikert2016challenges; @uludaug2021evolution; @uludaug2022revealing].

# Exercise {background-color="#efefef"}

Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is popular with very large teams that require much more structure due to team size and complexity. SAFe is itself complex, but also effective. In SAFe, work is organized into three levels of Agile management: team, program and portfolio. All work moves along on what is known in SAFe as an Agile Release Train (ART).

Do some research on [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), try to understand the framework (start with the essionals) and explain how SAFe adresses the **coordination challenges** and the **requirements engineering challenges**.
