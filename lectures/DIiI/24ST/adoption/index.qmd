Under what conditions does IT/digital innovation create **added value** in a company?
:::

## IS business value

Value created by IT is‚Äîin a business context‚Äîusually referred to as IT/IS business value.

. . .

> IS business value is the impact of investments in particular IS assets on the multidimensional performance and capabilities of economic entities at various levels, complemented by the ultimate meaning of performance in the economic environment. *@schryen2013revisiting [p. 141]*

. . .

The ultimate meaning of performance refers to what is subsequently derived if the outcome is exploited, e.g.

:::incremental
- impact on performance of a workflow management system: faster business processes
- the ultimate meaning: is dependent on the use of gained time **and** the extent to which competitors have speeded up their processes

## Usage as the missing link

:::notes
IT assets need to be used in order to create any impact that, eventually, creates value.

# Adoption and use

![Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [@venkatesh2003user]](images/utaut.svg){#fig-UTAUT}

:::notes
The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) suggests that the actual use of technology is determined by behavioural intention. The perceived likelihood of adopting the technology is dependent on the direct effect of four key constructs, namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The effect of predictors is moderated by age, gender, experience and voluntariness of use
:::

## Efective use

![A model for effective use and its effect on performance according to @burton2013use](images/effective-use.svg){#fig-effectiveUse}

:::notes

:::{.small}
Key for @fig-effectiveUse: Solid arrows reflect primary paths; dashed arrows reflect secondary paths; boxed arrows reflect necessary causality (i.e., x enables but does not determine
y ). Bolding on ‚Äúuser,‚Äù ‚Äúsystem‚Äù and ‚Äútask‚Äù reflect the relative emphasis on each element of use (bold reflects more emphasis).
:::

The **Theory of Effective Use** defines effective use as ‚Äúusing a system in a way that helps attain the goals of using the system‚Äù [@burton2013use, p. 636] and conceptualizes it to consist of three dimensions: transparent interaction, representational fidelity, and informed action.

*Transparent interaction* is the extent to which a user is accessing the system‚Äôs representations unimpeded by its surface and physical structures.

*Representational fidelity* is the extent to which a user is obtaining representations from the system that faithfully reflect the domain being represented.

*Informed action* is the extent to which a user acts upon the faithful representations he or she obtains from the
system to improve his or her state.
