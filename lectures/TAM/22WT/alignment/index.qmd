# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> Without execution of the strategic direction set for investments in line with the enterprise architecture vision and I&T road map, technology will hardly create value. It is essential to **evaluate, prioritize and balance initiatives**; **manage demand** within resource and funding constraints based on their alignment with strategic objectives, enterprise worth and risk; to **move selected programs into the active portfolio for execution**; **monitor the performance** of the overall portfolio; **propose adjustments** as necessary in response to program, product or service performance or changing enterprise priorities. *Based on COBIT 2019, AP005 Managed Portfolio*

Knowing the strategic direction set for investments seems to be important.

But what is strategy and what are related strategic alignments anyway?

## Strategy

When dealing with strategy, one could legitimately discuss everything that has been written about organizations [@starbuck1965organizational].

. . .

To reduce ambiguity and consolidate the views on strategy, @mintzberg2000rise, e.g., has offered five different perspectives of strategy:

:::{.incremental}
- A *plan*; a direction of how to get from here to there;
- A *pattern* if consistent behavior over time;
- A *position*, created by a different set of activities and typically results in a unique set of products in particular markets;
- A *perspective*; the fundamental way of doing things;
- A *play*; a deception, a specific manourvre intended to outwit an opponent or competitor.

. . .

Porter described strategy as *the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities* [@porter1996strategy].

## Strategic alignment

![Strategic alignment model by @henderson1999strategic](images/sam.svg){#fig-sam}

:::{.notes}
The **external domain** is the business area in which the company competes and is concerned with decisions related to the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities. This includes a range of "make-versus-buy" decisions, including partnerships and alliances. 

The **internal domain** deals with decisions related to the organizational structure (e.g., functional or departmental or matrix organization) and critical business processes (product delivery, product development, customer service, total quality), as well as acquiring and developing the human resource capabilities necessary to achieve the required organizational competencies.

@henderson1999strategic state that IT strategy should be articulated in terms of an external domain—how the firm is positioned in the IT marketplace (i.e., where the firm obtains critical technological functionality that supports and shapes business strategy)—and an internal domain—how the IT infrastructure should be configured and managed.

What role do projects play in strategic alignment?

## Projects

**Projects** are defined as "temporary endeavor[s] undertaken to create a unique product, service or result" [@project2000guide, p. 5].

. . .

Projects are "critical to the realization of the performing organization’s business strategy because projects are a means by which strategy is implemented" [@project2000guide, p. 4].

. . .

**IS project alignment** refers to "the degree to which information system (IS) project deliverables are consistent with the objectives project’s objectives, which are shaped by the organization’s IS strategy" [@jenkin2010project, p. 35]. 

. . .

IS project alignment focuses on creating a set of final project deliverables that will execute the organization’s IS strategy—implement the strategic systems, products and processes—and lead to positive business effects [@jenkin2010project, p. 36].

## Project portfolios

A **project portfolio** is a collection of projects, programs[^program], and subsidiary portfolios as a group to achieve *strategic objectives*.

. . .

The components of a portfolio

:::{.incremental}
- are driven by the organization's strategic goals and objectives;
- represent **investments** made or planned;
- are **quantifiable** (e.g., can be categorized, evaluated, prioritized, authorized);
- may be **independent** or **interdependent**;
- may have **related or unrelated objectives**;
- compete for a share of some or all of a set of **limited resources**.
:::

[^program]: A program is a group of *related projects* managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually [@pmi2017program].

## Portfolio management

**Project portfolio management** is "the coordinated management of portfolio components to achieve specific organizational objectives" [@pmi2017portfolio, p. 6].

. . .

A **portfolio management framework** provides the ability to translate corporate strategy into a portfolio of strategic and operational initiatives, optimizing and balancing portfolio components to achieve strategic goals.

. . .

**Portfolio management** ensures actualization of those initiatives through the use of organizational resources.

. . .

**IS portfolio alignment** focuses on creating and maintaining a set of portfolio components that best execute the organization's business and IS strategy—implement information systems, products, and processes that increase value-added capabilities and lead to positive business impact.

## Portfolio management process

## Identify components

Creation of an **up-to-date list of qualified components** (usually stemming from IT demands) that will be managed through portfolio management.

. . .

![Identify components: inputs, tools & techniques, and outputs [@pmi2017portfolio]](images/identification.svg){#fig-identification}

### Examples for component definition and key descriptors

Component definition is used to make a first screening on the component list; component key decriptors are used for categorizing, evaluating, and selecting components. 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
#### Component definition 

- Alignment for strategy
- Class (e.g., funding category)
- Size (e.g., budget, resources)
- Duration
- Impact for benefit
- Impact for risk,
- Urgency
- ...
:::

::: {.column}
#### Component key descriptors

- Id-number
- Description
- Strategic objectives supported
- Quantitative benefits
- Qualitative benefits
- Sponsor
- Key stakeholders
- Key resources required
- ...
:::

::::
## Categorize components

**Organization of components** (usually project or program proposals) into relevant business groups to which a common set of decision filters and criteria can be applied (e.g., funding category, time frame, organizational focus).

. . .

![Categorize components: inputs, tools & techniques, and outputs [@pmi2017portfolio]](images/categorization.svg){#fig-categorization} 

:::{.notes visibility="hidden"}

#### Examples for categories

- Increased profitability (revnue increase, generation, cost reduction)
- Risk reduction
- Efficiency improvement
- Legal/regulatory obligation
- Market share increase
- Process improvement
- Continuous improvement
- Foundational (e.g., investments that biild the infrastructure to grow the business)
- Business imperatives

:::

## Evaluate components

**Collection of information** (quantitative and/or qualitative) for the review of portfolio components in preparation for the selection process.

. . .

### Graphical representations

## Select components

Development of a **subset of the organization's components** based on defined selection criteria that will be considered for further priorization (e.g., RoI, resource demand, strategic impact).

. . .

![Select components: inputs, tools & techniques, and outputs [@pmi2017portfolio]](images/selection.svg){#fig-selection}

:::{.notes visibility="hidden"}

#### Human resource capacity analyses

The purpose is to understand the capacity of the organization to source and execute the selected projects. The analysis should be performed on organizational skill sets to determine the constraint generated by certain skill-set limitations. Internal resource capacity must be measured and external resource availability must be established—both define a limiting factor for the number of projects or the size of projects the organization can execute.

#### Financial capacity analysis

The purpose is to understand the capacity of the organization to finance the selected process—another limiting factor for the number of projects or the size of projects the organization can execute.

# Portfolio risk management

Portfolio risk is an **uncertain event, set of events, or conditions**, that if they occur, have one or more effects either positive or negative. The objective are to increase the probability and impact of positive events and to decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to the portfolio.
