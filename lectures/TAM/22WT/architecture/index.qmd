# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> The Enterprise Architecture (EA) function is a core element of the foundation that both enables and accelerates the tech transformation that companies need in order to compete in a digital-first world. *KcKinsey & Company*

What is architecture in general and with regard to enterprises?

## Architecture

Architecture is ...

:::{.incremental}
- **design**—conceptual visualization;
- the attempt to **quantify existing and future capabilities**;
- a **communication medium** for bringing together the stakeholders who rely on that capability;
- **complex**—there is more than one type of architecture, these are often symbiotic in nature
- **a system of systems**, represented by an architecture of architectures
- **evolutionary**—it changes just a we do;
- **data**;
- ...

## Definition

> Enterprise Architecture is a discipline that manages the fundamental organization of an enterprise, which is embodied in its components, their relationships to one another and the
environment, and the principles that govern its design and evolution. *ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011*

. . .

Enterprise Architecture (EA) delivers a **holistic view ("blueprint")** for how the organization achieves the current and future business objectives. 

. . .

EA examines the key business, information, application, and technology architectures and their impact on business functions across an entire company or enterprise.

. . .

The goal of EA is to provide real solutions to business needs through analyzing, designing, planning, and implementing the right technology in the right ways.

:::{.notes}

Business architecture
: Combines key business processes, governance, company structure, and strategy into a holistic view with the goal of describing a vision of business capabilities and value to be delivered. Examples include renting a car, approving a mortgage, or scheduling an appointment .

Application architecture
: Provides an overarching view of the applications needed to support the business vision. Includes describing services and interfaces.

Data architecture
: Guides the development of logical and physical data models. 

Technology architecture
: Specifies the network, compute, storage, and other hardware resources required to support and enable the overall architecture.

## Need

The importance of technology in driving business value increases, most industries are even **dramatically reshaped by digital technologies.**

. . .

Effects:

:::{.incremental}
- The business becomes indistinguishable from the digital services that represents it
- Data is generated in enormous quantity and speed (e.g. OT data)
- The way infrastructure and applications are deployed, consumed, and operated has dramatically changed
- ...

## Status quo

> The current prevailing enterprise architectures lack the key elements—such as agility, scale, security, and observability—needed to capitalize on technological shifts and to protect against the growing sophistication of cybercriminals. *Geng Lin, Executive VP and CTO at F5, Inc.*

. . .

To progress further in their digital transformation journeys, companies will require a **new approach to enterprise architecture** that is purpose-built for the digital economy @lucke2010critical.

## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

What are (main) objectives of EA or EA management, respectively?

## Objectives

In a digital-first world where success demands **increased transparency** and **reduced complexity**, the main objectives of EA are threefold:

:::{.incremental}
- **Enabling strategic decisions**—strategy provides a plan for the future; EA designs a system that enables that plan.
- **Ensuring reusability**—identification of features across products and solutions for reuse in close alignment with the strategy.
- **Enabling development speed**—providing a consistent technology stack (involving the technology components and curated set of patterns) that comes as ready-to-use platform.

:::{.notes}

EA further leads to

- **IT costs reduction**—eliminating redundant applications, vendor consolidation, server consolidation, license optimization, shared services
- **Technology risk mitigation**—increased compliance (e.g., GDPR), reduced incidents
- **Innovation capability**—increased flexibility and agility
- **Reporting simplification**—standardization and redundant work reduction
- **Collaboration improvements**—increased knowledge sharing

## Capabilities

Capabilities required to progress through the **digital transformation** journey and to compete in the marketplace [@lin2022enterprise]:

:::{.incremental}
- Using infrastructure as efficiently as possible by **delivering applications in a distributed model** that includes private and public clouds, data centers, and edge computing
- Expanding and scaling **digital operations** by adopting site reliability engineering practices to align technology with business outcomes
- Operating securely at scale by **incorporating security as a key component in every aspect of a digital business**
- Taking advantage of AI and analytics in both IT and lines of business by re-imagining data architectures and governance to adapt to the **convergence of operational technology (OT) and IT**
:::

## Frameworks

An EA framework

:::{.incremental}
- defines how to **create and use an enterprise architecture**;
- provide **principles and practices for creating and using the architecture description** of a system;
- **structures architects’ thinking** by dividing the architecture description into domains, layers, or views;
- offers **models for documenting** each view;
- allows for making **systemic design decisions** on all the components of the system and making long-term
decisions around new design requirements, sustainability, and support.

Popular examples: Zachman Framework and *The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)*

## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

What disadvantages, if any, are associated with consistent architecture management?

# Example: TOGAF {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

## Introduction

TOGAF is a popular standard for EA management developed and maintained by [The Open Group](https://opengroup.org)[^OG] to *provide the methods and tools for assisting in the acceptance, production, use, and maintenance of an enterprise architecture".

. . .

TOGAF is based on an iterative process model based on the **architecture development method (ADM)** and supported by best practices and a re-usable set of existing architecture assets.

. . .

ADM is carried out within an iterative cycle oscillation between architecture definition and realization to allow organizations to **transform their enterprises in a controlled manner** in response to business goals and opportunities.

[^OG]: A vendor- and technology-neutral consortium.

## ADM

:::{.notes visibility="hidden"}

#### Key points about the ADM:

- The ADM is iterative, over the whole process, between phases, and within phases. For each iteration of the ADM, a fresh decision must be taken as to:
    - The breadth of coverage of the enterprise to be defined
    - The level of detail to be defined
    - The extent of the time period aimed at, including the number and extent of any intermediate time periods
    - The architectural assets to be leveraged, including:
        - Assets created in previous iterations of the ADM cycle within the enterprise
        - Assets available elsewhere in the industry (other frameworks, systems models, vertical industry models, etc.)
- These decisions should be based on a practical assessment of resource and competence availability, and the value that can realistically be expected to accrue to the enterprise from the chosen scope of the architecture work.
- As a generic method, the ADM is intended to be used by enterprises in a wide variety of different geographies and applied in different vertical sectors/industry types. As such, it may be, but does not necessarily have to be, tailored to specific needs. For example, it may be used in conjunction with the set of deliverable of another framework, where these have been deemed to be more appropriate for a specific organization.


#### Phases

The preliminary phase describes the preparation and initiation activities required to prepare to
meet the business directive for a new enterprise architecture, including the definition of an
Organization-Specific Architecture framework and the definition of principles.

Phase A: **Architecture vision** describes the initial phase of an architecture development cycle. It includes information about defining the scope, identifying the stakeholders, creating the architecture vision, and obtaining approvals.

Phase B, C, D: Describe the development of the domain architectures to support an agreed architecture vision.

Phase E: **Opportunities & solutions** conducts initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases.

Phase F: **Migration planning** addresses the formulation of a set of detailed sequence of transition architectures with a supporting implementation and migration plan.

Phase G: **Implementation governance** provides an architectural oversight of the implementation.

Phase H: **Architecture change management** establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture.

**Requirements management** examines the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM.

## Exercise {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

Create a map of the capability you need to succeed in your studies (for inspiration see [here](assets/LeanIX-BCM.pdf)). 

Add the **information systems** that support or enable these capabilities.

Look for categories of information systems that are relevant to managing your personal "capability architecture" (e.g., life cycle, delivery method, cots, etc.).
