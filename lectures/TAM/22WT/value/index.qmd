## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

Under what conditions do technologies and applications create added value in a company?

## IS business value

> IS business value is the impact of investments in particular IS assets on the multidimensional performance and capabilities of economic entities at various levels, complemented by the ultimate meaning of performance in the economic environment [@schryen2013revisiting, p. 141].

. . .

The ultimate meaning of performance refers to what is subsequently derived if the outcome is exploited, e.g.

:::{.incremental}
- impact on performance of a workflow management system: faster business processes
- the ultimate meaning: is dependent on the use of gained time **and** the extent to which competitors have speeded up their processes

## Taxonomy of IS business value

# Resources and value

The resource based view supports that firms may achieve a competitive advantage based on their bundles of resources and capabilities [@peteraf2013elephant].

. . .

The dynamic capabilities view argues that firms have to evolve their resource and capability base in order to ensure a sustained competitive advantage [@peteraf2013elephant] — two types of resources:

:::{.incremental}
- **ordinary or operational capabilities**, which allow firms to survive in the present by supporting existing operations
- **dynamic capabilities** (DC) , which are directed towards strategic change of ordinary capabilities and resources
:::

. . .

DCs govern the change of other organizational capabilities [@teece2014dynamic].

# Adoption and use

![Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [@venkatesh2003user]](images/utaut.svg){#fig-UTAUT}

:::{.notes}
The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) suggests that the actual use of technology is determined by behavioural intention. The perceived likelihood of adopting the technology is dependent on the direct effect of four key constructs, namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The effect of predictors is moderated by age, gender, experience and voluntariness of use

## Efective use

![A model for effective use and its effect on performance ( [@burton2013use, p. 643]](images/effective-use.svg){#fig-effectiveUse}

:::{.notes}

:::{.small}
Key for @fig-effectiveUse: Solid arrows reflect primary paths; dashed arrows reflect secondary paths; boxed arrows reflect necessary causality (i.e., x enables but does not determine
y ). Bolding on “user,” “system” and “task” reflect the relative emphasis on each element of use (bold reflects more emphasis).
:::

The Theory of Effective Use defines effective use as “using a system in a way that helps attain the goals of using the system” [@burton2013use, p. 636] and conceptualizes it to consist of three dimensions: transparent interaction, representational fidelity, and informed action.

*Transparent interaction* is the extent to which a user is accessing the system’s representations unimpeded by its surface and physical structures.

*Representational fidelity* is the extent to which a user is obtaining representations from the system that faithfully reflect the domain being represented.

*Informed action* is the extent to which a user acts upon the faithful representations he or she obtains from the
system to improve his or her state.
