# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> Transparency is an essential force for changing the role of IT from order taker to strategic partner. By being clear about costs an performance, CIOs can take charge of the value conversation. They can show their capabilities as IT leaders, help business leaders to improve their processes, and then take on new strategic roles. *@hunter2009real*

# Introduction {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

## Need for transparency

> IT should be able to map its actual spending to appropriate business areas, so that **business stakeholders can understand the cost IT has incurred** on their behalf.    
This information is vital for engaging these business stakeholders, creating a sense of budget ownership, and motivating business decisions that optimize application spending. *@tucker2016technology*

. . .

Do you agree with this statement?       

If so, what are challenges related to mapping IT spending to business areas?

## Reasons for cost allocation

Allocation of IT costs to business units provides following benefits: 

:::{.incremental}
- Supports alignment of spending with **perceived value**
- Shapes business unit **demand and consumption**
- Supports BU level **“P&L” (profit & loss) management**
- Supports **transfer pricing and tax calculations** for multinational companies
- Supports transfer pricing for JVs, subsidiaries and other legal arrangements
- Enables funding of specific programs (e.g., centralized purchasing of public cloud services)
:::

. . .

However, cost allocation requires sound **IT financial management** (ITFM).

## Goals of ITFM


Budgeting & forecasting
: Managing the IT budget effectively, driving stakeholder accountability and improving budget transparency

. . .

Optimizing costs
: Identifying cost optimization opportunities, understanding the impact theses choices,
establishing an on going optimization discipline

. . .

Allocating costs
: Selecting a charge back approach, communicating costs in business terns, and exposing levers and choices to the business

. . .

Investment planning
: Adjusting the mix of project and product portfolios, tracking investment value by teams, tracking forecasting and adjusting capacity as needed

. . .

Multiple challenges to achieving these goals, e.g., required data is distributed in multiple data sources, which were never meant to integrate


## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

Which **cost components** do you need to consider when allocating costs for

- an ERP system; and
- end-user workplace

What **data** do you need to collect from what **sources**?

## Components of IT cost allocation

![Components that need to be considered in FITM](images/components.svg){#fig-components}

## Required data

Financials
: General ledger (OpEx), capital expenditures (CapEx), budget (OpEx and CapEx), cost center hierarchy, chart of accounts

. . .

Fixed assets
: Data center infrastructure inventory, fixed asset depreciation schedule

. . .

Labor
: Available labor details (role, team, location)

. . .

Products & projects
: Tickets, story points, project details, time tracking

. . .

Solutions
: Application list, service catalog, product catalog, SaaS billing, SSO-managed apps

. . .

Value streams
: Digital platforms, product lines, business capabilities, business unit details

## Data challenges

:::{.incremental}
- Lack of complete or reliable application or service inventory data
- Lack of complete or reliable inventories of your desktop and mobile devices
- Difficulties to correctly map entitlement data to business units (e.g., due inconsistent user account mapping, impossibility to identify inactive accounts)
- Lack of overview of assets due to many IT asset management systems and/or poorly maintained asset data
- Difficulties to relate general ledger data to IT assets
- Consumption or reservation data varies during each period
- Many potential sources of labor data (e.g., PPM, time tracking, service desk tickets)
- Outside labor that doesn’t record time worked in your systems
- etc.

## Approaches to cost allocations

::::{.columns}

:::{.column .fragment}
#### Costing by BUs

:::{.incremental}
- Costs of solutions or other objects may be modelled based on actuals
- Actuals basis may result in “lumpiness” of costs from period to period and be difficult to predict
- Helps determine how BU consumption drove actual costs, regardless of how those costs are billed or charged back
- Provides a critical component (expense) of a solution level “P&L” (solution specific income statement)
:::

:::

:::{.column .fragment}
#### Billing the BUs

:::{.incremental}
- A bill of IT may be produced showing BUs their consumption and the costs they drove
- Costs may be based on actuals, rates (prices) or budget
- Rates are often preferred but requires extra planning and discipline
- If chargeback is employed, bills should match charges 
- Provides the other (income) component of a solution level “P&L"
:::

:::


::::


:::{.notes}
#### Charging the BUs {visibility="hidden"}

- Charge back can be done without any bill of IT or showback (not recommended)
- Variances between charge backs and actual costs must be managed (typically quarterly or annually)
- Clear business rules must be established up front for what costs are charged, the basis for those charges, and how variances are handled

# Example: TBM {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

Technology Business Management (TBM) provides the technology leaders with standards and validated best practices to communicate the cost, quality and value of IT investments to their business partners [@tucker2016technology].

## Introduction

The TBM framework provides a **universal language** to evaluate and communicate IT spend and associated business value in a data-driven manner.

. . .

One of TBM's primary tools is the **TBM taxonomy** (see @fig-tbm-taxonomy).

. . .

The taxonomy provides a **standard for describing cost sources, technologies, IT assets (IT towers), applications and services** that can be applied across industries and countries

. . .

TBM not only makes internal discussions clearer, but also enables easier **external benchmarking** to justify investments.

. . .

The TBM taxonomy is managed and maintained by the *TBM Council Board Committee on Standards*, which is part of the nonprofit organization *[TBM Council](https://www.tbmcouncil.org/)*.

## The TBM taxonomy

::: {.notes}

The TBM taxonomy clarifies and organizes IT costs, units, and other metrics from disparate sources, assets, and services in a hierarchical manner and provides a *common set of terms* to describe them. Its hierarchy included three views supported by four main layers of objects.

Cost pool
: Describe the type of asset or service purchased using terms and groupings relevant to both IT and Finance.

IT towers & sub-towers
: Describe the technology functions supported by IT spend in terms and groupings relevant to 
the owners and consumers of those functions

Application & services
: Describe the products or outputs delivered by IT and consumed by business units

Business units
: Describe the consumers of the technology supported by IT spend

:::

![The TBM taxonomy [@tucker2016technology]](images/tbm-taxonomy.svg){#fig-tbm-taxonomy}

## The TBM model

:::{.notes}

A tool for mapping and allocating costs and other resources from one layer of the TBM taxomony to another. It includes the TBM taxonomy objects and layers plus the data requirements, *allocation rules**, and metrics needed to create **transparency** and enable the reporting that is needed to evaluate and communicate cost, quality, and value of IT investments. The TBM model creates the financial, tehcnical, and business views that are meaningful to various decision makers and stakeholders [@tucker2016technology].

The TBM model is normally built and processed using software (e.g., the TBM solution [ApptioOne](https://www.apptio.com/products/apptioone/)).

:::

![The TBM model [based on @tucker2016technology]](images/tbm-model.svg){#fig-tbm-model}

:::{.notes}
#### Finance view

This view begins with the general ledger, but may include other cost sources unique to your organization. The taxonomy provides for a standard set of breakouts (e.g., CapEx vs. OpEx, fixed v-s variable cost) and a standard set of cost pools as in hardware, software, internal labor, external labor facilities/overhead, and outside services.

Cost pools not only make cost allocation easiery, they enhance reporting as they can be traced through teh model to reveal the composition of your costs and allow for comparibility of composition (e.g., how much internal labor is found in this service vs. that one?) [@tucker2016technology].

#### IT view

This view includes a common set of infrastructure towers and sub-towers, such as servers, storage, voice and data networks, applicaiton development, and support. These towers are in use by nearly all companies and are the basic building blocks of specific appliactions, services, etc. Regardless of where they come from (e.g., internally or via the public cloud), this view enables IT leader to assess how cost-effective IT is in its delivery of technologies and services [@tucker2016technology].

#### Business view

This view provides a standard, generic set of applications and services along with the business capabilities they support. At this layer of the model, the creation of industry-specific elements that will allow for more meaningful reporting and comparison for each vertical is anticipated. This layer also includes the business unit consumers or breakouts (allocations) by consumer [@tucker2016technology].

## Key performance indicators

TBM can help IT leaders to improve cost for performance by increasing transparency on cost, quality and value of IT investments.

. . .

To measure success, TBM offer a set of key performance indicators (KPIs).

::::{.columns}

:::{.column .fragment}
#### Cost for performance

:::{.incremental}
- Unit cost actuals vs. targets for IT towers
- Unit cost actuals vs. targets for business facing services or applications
- Percentage of business-facing servies meeting SLAs
- Satisfaction scores for business facing services
:::

:::

:::{.column .fragment}
#### Business aligned portfolio

:::{.incremental}
- Actual spending (TCO) against targets for corporate outcomes (or categories)
- Actual spending (TCO) against targets for business-facing services or apps
- TCO by vendor category
- TCO by TIME (tolerate, invest, migrate an eliminate)

## TBM framework (teaser)

![The TBM framework defines the organizational elements, disciplines, and value conversations of an effective TBM program [tucker2016technology]](images/tbm-framework.svg){#fig-tbm-framework}

:::{.notes}
The TBM framework is comprised of the following elements:

- Two organizational elements: *Position for value* and *Continously improve*
- Four core disciplines: *Create transparency*, *Deliver value for money*, *Shape business demand*, and *Plan and govern*
- Four value conversations: *Cost for performance*, *Business-aligned portfolio*, *Investment in innovation*, and *Enterprise agility*

This section focuses on *cost of performance*. Cost transparency is key to achieving value for money and shaping demand. Cost transparency also enables better financial planning and management.

Value conversations are at the heart of the TBM framework. These conversations lead to trade-offs in optimizing business operations and shifting investments to change the business. In other words, they are collaborative decisions based on facts and data.

# Rates management {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

What do you need to make business units accountable for the costs of IT?

## The nature of rates

![Rates management](images/rates.svg){#fig-rates}

. . .

Rates are like prices[^prices]

:::{.incremental}
- they help to communicate costs based on solution volumes consumesd;
- provide predictability of cots;
- are typically set once or twice a year.
:::

. . .

The **provider** is accountable for rates, the **consumer** is accountable for volumes.

[^prices]: Most organizations avoid the term “prices” and prefer the term “rates”. “Price” can be viewed as connoting a profit margin.

## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

What types of tariffs can be used to charge for IT services?

## Types of rates

Named users
: Based on entitled users to a service or application; may vary based on type of user (e.g., power users vs. non power users)

. . .

Devices
: Based on type and number of devices provided and supported for a business unit 

. . .

Reservations
: Based on units of a resource (e.g., storage, virtual servers, user
accounts/seats) reserved for a business unit 

.  . .

Transactions
: Based on business transactions processed (e.g., orders processed) by a system

. . .

Consumption Tiers
: Based on a tier of consumption (e.g., 1,000 users)

. . .

Metered Usage
: Based on a unit of actual usage (e.g., user logins, minutes of calls made)


## Questions to be clarified

**Measure**

- What is the unit cost to deliver a solution (app, product, service or technology)?
- What approach you use (e.g., cost-based, cost-plus or cost-minus, market-based)?
- What is the appropriate unit of measure?

:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-notes}
#### "Pricing" strategies

**Cost-based**

-Rates are set based on anticipated costs and volumes
- No margin is included

**Cost-plus or cost-minus**

- Rates are based on anticipated costs and volumes
- Margins are included to accommodate variances or to pay for overhead not included in
the underlying unit cost
- Strategic pricing may be used to encourage or discourage consumption

**Market-based**

- Rates are set based on industry benchmarks or other comparables
- Consultants are often employed to understand external rates

:::
:::
. . . 

**Communicate**

- What is the price/cost per unit that you will show back or charge your consumers?
- How often do you adjust your rates?
- Who is accountable for variances between actual costs and rates?
- When are true ups and/or refunds issued? 

----

**Optimize**

- What is our target for the unit cost of a solution or technology?
- How do we set achievable targets?
- Who is accountable for meeting the targets?
- What actions can we take to reduce our rates? What are our addressable costs?
- When do we realize rate reduction benefits?

## Strategic pricing

Strategic pricing means subsidizing or surcharging solutions in order to encourage or
discourage consumption, improve fairness of allocations, or enable the adoption of a new
solution.

. . .

| Goals                                                          	| Subsidized services              	| Surcharged services               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------	|----------------------------------	|----------------------------------	|
| Encourage use of cloud-based infrastructure services to improve agility and refocus staff on core business applications 	| Cloud technologies             	| Non-cloud technology when better cloud option is available 	|
| Promotion of 2 young business units that are of long-term strategic importance                                          	| Services to new business units 	| Cash cows with shrinking markets                           	|
| Transition to a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) for more productivity, lower costs and more security               	| Thin clients                   	| Fat clients                                                	|

## Rate setting process

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

![Rates setting process](images/rate-setting.svg){#fig-rate-setting}

:::

:::{.column}
Rate setting is an **iterative process** with the business

:::{.incremental}
- Unit rates impact business demand which, in turn, impacts unit cost.
- Often initial rates are published via a “price book” during the planning process and revised through planning iterations.
- Going through 3 to 4 iterations of price books is not uncommon in larger enterprises.

# Bill of IT  {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}


## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

How should a **proper bill of IT** look like?

What is needed to create one?

## Characteristics
 
A proper **bill of IT** should give consumers of IT services or products the info they need to make better decisions about cost, consumption and performance (value trade offs).

. . .

Requirements:

- The **rate** for each thing you consumed
- The **volume** of IT solution consumed
- Someone within IT that is accountable for the bills
- A recipient for the bill

## Good practices

:::{.incremental}
- Deliver the bill to your consumers on a regular basis (monthly or quarterly)
- Provide essential details of cost and related consumption
  - Line items (services) with rates, consumption (volumes) and total costs
  - Other costs and basis for charges (e.g., % of employees)
  - Comparison of billed costs to prior periods
  - Comparison of billed costs to the consumers’ budgets (if known)
  - Rate changes (if any) along with reason for changes
- Have a regular consult with the BU leaders about their bills
  - Explain charges and especially any changes from expectations
  - Share opportunities to alter consumption and costs
- Provide a clear mechanism for reporting errors or omissions
  - Establish a clear policy for handling errors/omissions
  - Avoid credits for mistakes affecting prior periods (unless  amounts are significant)

# Cost recovery {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

## Let's discuss {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

What problems arise if you charge anything other than actual costs?

. . .

How do you now what's causing your variances?

## Challenges

If you recover costs based on anything other than actual costs, you have variances

. . .

It is difficult to determine what is causing variances between costs and cost recovery.

. . .

**Potential causes are**

:::{.incremental}
- Consumption behavior (i.e., volume)
- Price changes
- Service compositions (i.e., structure of services) 
:::

## Cost structure

![Demand levers vs. cost structure](images/cost-structure.svg){#fig-cost-structure}

## Managing variances

::::{.columns}

:::{.column .fragment}
#### Under-recovery of costs

:::{.incremental}
- Rates (if used) were insufficient to fully recover the costs incurred in delivering solutions (a deficit)
- A **true up** might be required by your CFO on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis
- Take care to track and communicate variance to avoid surprising business unit partners
:::

:::

:::{.column .fragment}
#### Over-recovery of costs

:::{.incremental}
- Rates (if used) were higher than needed, resulting in recovery of >100% of the costs incurred (a surplus)
- A refund might be required by your CFO
- Sometimes, surpluses can be used to fund other investments or to offset deficits elsewhere
