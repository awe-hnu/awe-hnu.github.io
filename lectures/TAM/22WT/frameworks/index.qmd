# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> IT organizations can draw on a variety of IT management frameworks to structure and optimize different aspects. Often, one framework is singled out and hailed as a panacea in any context. But caution is advised: Not every framework is suitable for every problem. *Peter Ratzer, Deloitte Partner*

# Introduction

Many different **frameworks** can be followed for organizing the management of information technology and applications. However, these often only cover a specific aspect of value creation by IT, such as strategy planning, delivery, sourcing, etc.

. . .

In this section, we will have a brief look at some frameworks or reference models, considered as **industry standards**, their foci and coverage of IT value creation.

. . .

Organizations often use more than one of these frameworks (or their proposed **methods** or best **practices**) to achieve their business goals.

## Discuss! {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

The terms *standard*, *framework*, *reference models*, *method*, and *best practices* are frequently used. How would you define them? How are they interrelated?

## Clarification of terms

### Standard

. . .

According to design science [@vom2020accumulation], a **standard** is an agreed artifact that results from a design process and describes a desired state of an area in reality. 

. . .

Standards can be regarded as “socio-economic constructs reflecting a balance of perspective between stakeholders” [@ahlemann2009project, p. 293].

----

### Frameworks and reference models

. . .

The artifact intended to become a standard is often called a **framework**, defined as “a construct of interlinked concepts […] in which each concept plays an integral role” [@jabareen2009framework, p. 51].

. . .

Management frameworks are often also labelled as **reference models** which are “abstract representations of domain knowledge […] useful for capturing prescriptive and descriptive design knowledge for sociotechnical problems” [@legner2020accumulating, p. 736].

----

### Methods and good practices

**Management methods** “guide choices within the ‘plan-act-control’ solution space of an organization in order to achieve certain (management) goals” [@winter2012construction, p. 68] and are often constituting components of management frameworks.

. . .

ISO describes **good practices** (or recommended practices) as “the best way” of doing something [@iso2009standardizationPractices, p. 3], thus, describes the attribute of a method (its normative or prescriptive character).

## Current state

As already discussed, the role of the IT function changes significantly due do the requirements posed by digital transformation.

. . .

>  “IT functions are required to cooperateproactively and early on with business departments to be able to develop and implement […] innovations jointly” [@urbach2019impact, p. 123]. 

. . .

However, due to the consensual nature of standards, contemporary ITM standards seem to offer few guidance for responding to new requirements, e.g.,

:::{.incremental}
- ITIL was updated with only minimal changes [@auth2021evolution]
- Many frameworks emphasize top-down alignment as well as high service quality at low cost and with low risk, resulting in lengthy planning cycles [@urbach2019impact]
:::

:::{.notes}
However, as pressure on IT to meet the challenges of digital transformation increased, so did the demand for new guidance on successful practices, spurring efforts by standards bodies and professional associations to improve existing standards and create additional ones  [@auth2021evolution].
:::

# Types

@auth2021evolution proposes to categorize the standards regarding the stages of evolution related to digital transformation:

. . .

Traditional IT management standards
: Standards established before digital transformation got momentum; mainly focus on improving efficiency, cost effectiveness, and service quality.

. . .

Related standards
: Standards that exist independently of IT management but are used there.

. . .

Digital technology management standards
: Standards that address digital transformation management or deal with related concepts (e.g., agile and lean).

. . .

Emerging standards
: Established concepts, frameworks, or practices that are not yet standardized.

## Reflect! {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

Which IT management standards, frameworks and concepts do you know? Which category would you assign them to? Why?

## Traditional IT management standards

ITIL, Cobit and CMMI are probably the most popular and best-known traditional IT management standards.

## Research! {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

Do a internet research on one of the following frameworks and prepare a very brief presentation of their aim/utility and what they cover.

- ISO27000
- PINCE2 or P2Agile
- TBM
- ITIL
- IT4IT or TOGAF

# Example: COBIT 2019 {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

## History

> COBIT 2019 "defines the components to build and sustain a governance system: processes, policies and procedures, organizational structures, information flows, skills, infrastructure, and culture and behaviors." *@lainhart2018COBIT*

. . .

COBIT was created by [ISACA](https://www.isaca.org/), an international professional association focused on IT (information technology) governance.

. . .

COBIT stood from the first version in 1996 to version 5 in 2021 for "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies". *Today it is just a name.*

. . .

COBIT is a set of references and best practices, not an ‘off-the-shelf’ cure (descriptive –not prescriptive)

## Discuss! {.html-hidden .unlisted .unnumbered .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets//bg.jpg"}

What are differences between IT governance and IT management?

:::{.notes}
COBIT is a framework for the *governance* and *management* of enterprise information and technology

**Governance** ensures that:

- Stakeholder needs, conditions and options are evaluated to determine balanced, agreed-on enterprise objectives.
- Direction is set through prioritization and decision making.
- Performance and compliance are monitored against agreed-on direction and objectives.

**Management** plans, builds, runs and monitors activities, in alignment with the direction set by the governance body, to achieve the enterprise objectives.

## Purpose

Definition of **the components** to build and sustain a governance system including *processes, organizational structures, policies and procedures, information flows, culture and behaviors, skills, and infrastructure*.

. . .

Exposition of **governance issues** by grouping relevant governance components into *governance* and *management objectives* that can be managed to the required capability levels.

. . .

Definition of **design factors** that should be considered by the enterprise to build a best-fit governance system.

## Overview

![COBIT overview](images/COBIT-framework.jpg){#fig-COBIToverview}

::: {.notes}

For information and technology to contribute to enterprise goals, a number of governance and management objectives should be achieved. Basic concepts relating to governance and management objectives are:

- A governance or management objective always **relates to one process** (with an identical or similar name) and a series of related components of other types to help achieve the objective.
- A governance objective relates to a governance process (depicted in the dark blue background in @fig-COBIToverview), while a management objective relates to a management process (depicted on the lighter blue background @fig-COBIToverview). Boards and executive management are typically accountable for governance processes, while management processes are the domain of senior and middle management [@information2018cobit, p. 20]

:::

## Objectives

The governance and management objectives are grouped into five domains:

:::{.incremental}
- **Evaluate, Direct and Monitor (EDM)** *(governance)*—evaluation strategic options, direction of senior management on the chosen strategic options and monitoring the achievement of the strategy.
- **Align, Plan and Organize (APO)** *(management)*—overall organization, strategy and supporting activities for I&T.
- **Build, Acquire and Implement (BAI)** *(management)*—definition, acquisition and implementation of I&T solutions and their integration in business processes.
-  **Deliver, Service and Support (DSS)** *(management)*—operational delivery and support of I&T services, including security.
- **Monitor, Evaluate and Assess (MEA)** *(management)*—performance monitoring and conformance of I&T with internal performance targets, internal control objectives and external requirements.
:::

----

## Principles 

![COBIT principles](images/COBIT-principles.svg){#fig-COBITprinciples}

:::{.notes}

The six principles for a governance system are [@information2018cobit]:

1. Every company needs a governance system to satisfy stakeholder needs and **generate value from the use of information and technology**. Value reflects a balance between benefits, risk, and resources, and companies need an actionable strategy and governance system to realize that value.
2. A governance system for information and technology in the enterprise is composed of a number of components, which may be of different types and **interact holistically**.
3. A governance system should be **dynamic**. This means that any time one or more of the design factors are changed (e.g., a change in strategy or technology), the impact of those changes on the enterprise governance of information and technology (EGIT) system must be considered. A dynamic view of EGIT will result in a viable and future-proof EGIT system.
4. A governance system should clearly **distinguish between governance and management** activities and structures.
5. A governance system should be **tailored to the needs of the organization** and use a set of design factors as parameters for adjusting and prioritizing the components of the governance system.
6. A governance system should **cover the entire enterprise** and focus not only on the IT function, but on all the technology and information processing that the enterprise uses to achieve its goals, regardless of where in the enterprise the processing takes place.

:::

## Components

![Components of a governance system](images/COBIT-system.svg){#fig-COBITsystem}

:::{.notes}
To satisfy governance and management objectives, each enterprise needs to establish, tailor and sustain a governance system built from a number of components [@information2018cobit].

COBIT 2019 identifies the components of an effective EGIT system: processes; organizational structures; information flows and items; people, skills and competencies; policies and procedures; culture, ethics, and behavior; and services, infrastructure, and applications (@fig-COBITsystem):

- **Processes** describe an organized set of practices and activities to achieve certain objectives and produce a set of outputs that support achievement of overall IT-related goals.
- **Organizational structures** are the key decision-making entities in an enterprise.
- **Principles**, policies and frameworks translate desired behavior into practical guidance for day-to-day management.
- **Information** is pervasive throughout any organization and includes all information produced and used by the enterprise. COBIT focuses on information required for the effective functioning of the governance system of the enterprise.
- **Culture, ethics and behavior** of individuals and of the enterprise are often underestimated as factors in the success of governance and management activities.
- **People, skills and competencies** are required for good decisions, execution of corrective action and successful completion of all activities.
- **Services, infrastructure and applications** include the infrastructure, technology and applications that provide the enterprise with the governance system for information and technology (I&T) processing.

To achieve (any of) the governance and management objectives contained in the COBIT 2019 core model, enterprises should implement an EGIT system composed of these key components.
:::

## Goal cascade 

:::{.notes}
COBIT 2019 introduces an updated goals cascade. The achievement of the governance and management objectives enables the achievement of alignment goals, which in turn enables the achievement of enterprise goals. As such, stakeholder value is ultimately provided (i.e., meeting stakeholder needs) [@de2019enterprise].
:::

![Cobit goals cascade](images/COBIT-goalsCascade.svg){#fig-COBITgoals}

## Design factors

:::{.notes}
COBIT 2019 identifies the design factors (e.g., role of IT, compliance requirements, threat landscape, etc.) that should be considered in the context of designing and implementing an EGIT system that is tailored to the specific context of the enterprise.
:::

Design factors include any combination of the following:

![Cobit design factors](images/COBIT-designFactors.svg){#fig-COBITdesign}

:::{.notes}
Enterprise strategy
: Enterprises can have different strategies, which can be expressed as e.g., one of following archetypes: growth/aquisition, innovation/differentiation, cost leadership, client service/stability. Organizations typically have a primary strategy and, at most, one secondary strategy.

Enterprise goals
: The enterprise strategy is realized by the achievement of (a set of) enterprise goals. These goals are defined in the COBIT framework, structured along the balanced scorecard (BSC) dimensions, e.g., portfolio of competitive products and services, business-service continuity and availability, customer-oriented service culture.

Risk profile
: The risk profile identifies the sort of information & technology-related risk to which the enterprise is currently exposed and indicates which areas of risk are exceeding the risk appetite, e.g., IT operational infrastructure incidents, unauthorized actions, software adoption/usage problems.

I&T-related issues
: A related method for an I&T risk assessment for the enterprise is to consider which information & technology-related issues it currently faces, or what I&T-related risk has materialized, e.g., frustration between different IT entities across the organization because of a perception of low contribution to business value or failures to meet IT-related regulatory or contractual requirements.

Threat landscape
: The threat landscape under which the enterprise operates ranging from normal to high.

Compliance requirements
: The compliance requirements to which the enterprise is subject range from low compliance requirements to high compliance requirements, most often related to industry sector or geopolitical conditions.

Role of IT
: The role that IT plays within the company ranges from a support role to production and turnaround to strategy.

Sourcing model for IT
: Describes how the IT sources technology, applications and services, spanning insourced, outsourced, cloud or hybrid models.

IT implementation methods
: Identifies how the enterprise implements applications and technologies, ranging from traditional, to agile, DevOps or hybrid models.

Technology adoption strategy
: Describes if the enterprise is a first mover, a follower or a slow adpoter.

## Focus areas

COBIT 2019 introduces the concept of **focus areas**, which aims to focus on specific problem-solving situations while adhering to the COBIT 2019 core model and its governance and management objectives [@de2019enterprise].

. . .

A focus area refers to a specific topic or issue that can be addressed by a specific collection of governance and management objectives and their components (or a variant of the generic guidance). 

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- E.g., small and medium enterprises, cybersecurity, digital transformation, cloud computing, privacy, and DevOps
- May contain a combination of generic governance components and variants
- The number of focus areas is virtually unlimited—makes COBIT open-ended
:::

## Performance management

COBIT proposes activities and methods to evaluate and improve the EGIT system and its components to achieve the required level of performance—termed as COBIT performance management.

. . .

To measure the **performance of EGIT processes**, COBIT 2019 proposes a process capability scheme based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI).

. . .

Process capability levels relate to a governance or management objective and define activities that are required (at a minimum) to achieve that level.

. . .

COBIT 2019 also defines maturity levels as a performance measure at the **focus area level** (a collection of governance and management objectives and underlying components) and of **information items**.

### Information items

An information item can be assessed by considering the extent to which the relevant quality criteria are achieved.

:::{.incremental}
- **Intrinsic** — accuracy, objectivity, believability, and reputation of information
- **Contextual** — relevancy, completeness, currency, appropriate amount, concise representation, consistent representation, interpretability, understandability, and ease of manipulation of information
- **Security, privacy, accessability** — availability and restricted access
