# Task

Imagine you are part of the __young leadership development program__ at ACME inc., a large, multinational company with multiple business lines. 

. . .

Your task is to create a __management concept__ that tackles the challenges and, once implemented, improves the way technology and application is managed within the company within two years and, thus, its output significantly (i.e., IT management).

. . .

You will work in a group and develop the concept in a __sprint-based approach__ within approximately 10 weeks and then present it to the board. You will also hand-in a comprehensive documentation of your proposal (i.e., semianr paper).

. . .

The wining team will replace the existing IT management team.

## Company

The company and its it can‚Äîin a nutshell‚Äîbe charaterized as follows.

::: {.incremental}
- Approx. 8,000 employees worldwide; approx. 120 within global IT
- Three business units operating process production); one forward-integrated (discrete production)
- Centralized IT, most parts located in the HQ, local staff to ensure operation 
- Monolithical core technology for the legacy business in Europe (approx. 50%)
- Operation of core technologies and infrastructures in two large data centers
- 24 billion IT budget (approx. 70 % staff, 10 % infrastructure, 20 % applications)
- Approx 50% of IT capacity planned for projects (mostly run the business); covers only 20% of business demands
:::

## Challenges

The company has difficulties to realize the value they expect from their IT, amongst others due to

:::{.incremental}
- Coporate IT struggles with responding fast to changing business demands
- Both shadow IT and legacy technologies and applications pose major continouity and security risks
- Due to many (large) acquisitions, the company uses many redundant core systems (ERP, MES, CRM) and presumably countless systems on the periphery
- IT resources are mainly dedicated for running the business
- Runaway technology projects paralyze both operational efficiency and growth
- The company has repeatedly relied on inferior technologies and applications that are now costly and difficult to replace
- As IT governs only its own spending and performance, the company struggles a lot with (unsuported) shadow IT
:::

## Approach

You will adopt an agile approach to create the management concept. Andy Weeger, the CEO of the fictional company will act as a product owner and help you to understand and analyze the problem thouroughly. You just have to ask the right questions (as often in life ;-)

. . .

Your work will be structured in three phases (i.e., sprints)

. . .

:::{.html-hidden}
- __Sprint 1:__ problem understanding and approach to tackle the main problems
- __Sprint 2:__ detailed description of the selected tools/methods incl. application
- __Sprint 3:__ summary of approach, lessons learned and discussion
:::

. . .

:::{.notes}
- The __first phase__ is focused on problem understanding, the development of an overarching framework that tackles the main problems as well as selecting and interrelating efficient tools
- The __second phase__ is focused on elaborating the selected tools/methods, describing them and applying them exemplarily. Best case, you also develop an artefact that supports application (e.g., an Excel tool)
- The __third phase__ is focused on the refinement and wrap-up. You work out the relationship of the methods to the problems and goals in detail. In addition, you extract your lessons learned and give an outlook on how the management concept can be extended or improved in the future.
:::

The management concept should help the organization to manage technologies and application efficiently, i.e. to align organization and technology, reduce friction, and chart future transformation journeys

# Deliverables

## Paper

The final artefact/product (i.e., seminar paper) needs to include following elements:

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- Management summary
- Comprehensive problem statement and goals
- Overview of framework (areas, tools, interrelations)
- Detailed presentation of the management tools (one per student)
- Summary incl. lessons learned and discussion
- Glossary (definitions of main terms/concepts, establishes a common language)
:::

:::{.notes}

#### Framework

Your management concept will not solve all problems at once. However, a comprehensive management approach that skillfully links the processes and outcomes of the proposed tools will accelerate ACME Inc.'s journey toward strong IT business value realization. 

The framework answers questions concerned with __what__ ACME inc. needs to focus on and to do to improve the value of technologies and applications deployed.

It is your task to create such a framework, which effectiveness is easily understandable by the CEO and connects technology and applications and the business.

The framework should describe the overarching goal(s) and/or goal cascade, the principles, focus areas (i.e., the sociotechnical elements your approach tackles to achieve the goals), and the management tools that you propose.

To create your management framework, you need

- a __comprehensive understanding of the core problem__ (these might differ from group to group, there is no single correct problem statement). This requires you to cut the elephant into pieces.
- a good __overview of exiting frameworks__ and management methods to synthesize a lean model that tackles your problem statement

#### Management tools

In the management tool section the methods that you propose are presented in greater detail. 

As your framework provides answers about __what__ needs to be done, the tool section outlines __how__ management of technologies and applications should be organized.

As to that you introduce the method that ACME should use in a way that both business and IT managers can comprehend. You also show by means of a (fictional) example that relates to ACME (ask the CEO for details and what assumptions can be made) how the method is being applied (e.g., the specific tools used, the roles required, the outcomes achieved). You also reflect about the strenghts and weeknesses of the method.

For instance, it could be reasonable that you suggest implementing an approach to improve enterprise architecture. Then you should explain what enterprise architecture management is and how you suggest ACME inc. should implement it. Depending on the problem statement, you will find different aspects of EAM useful. It's up to you to recommend and describe the right ones.

## Status reports

There are three review sessions during the semester where you will present your interim results to all students and get feedback from me. Please prepare a focused slide deck to present the current state of your management concept (i.e., product increment).

. . .

In addition, there will be allmost weekly stand-up meetings where you present your progress and might also get some helpful comments. Here the progress will be documented using your "Flap"[^FLAP].

[^FLAP]: The "Flap" is an overview of all tasks that are required to achieve the learning goal. This overview is a collection of stories, celebration criteria, work agreements, tasks, and impediments that the student teams will complete for the sprint. 

. . .

For dates please see the [schedule](../0/index.html#schedule)

#### The "Flap"

The "Flap" is an overview of all tasks that are required to achieve the project goals. This overview is a collection of stories, celebration criteria, work agreements, tasks, progress ("run up chart") and impediments that the your team will complete for the sprint. 

The Flap is a chronological representation of time. The tasks move based on their status of: "To Do‚Äù, "Busy" and "Done". In addition, the Flap provides insight into the planning. It shows exactly where your team is with regard to ready and remaining work. The Flap is therefore a prediction whether you will achieve the stated objectives. The Flap must be constantly updated so that it always gives an "up to date" status of your progress. This update is done at least after every stand up.

The Flap is a plan with sufficient detail so that changes in progress can be understood in the stand up. You will adjust the Flap during the sprint and it develops during the sprint. The Flap can therefore be revised at any time based on progressive insight.
If new work is needed, you add it to the Flap. This already takes into account the number of work points that are given in advance when planning. If parts of the plan prove unnecessary, they will be removed.

I recommend creating your Flap using digital whiteboarding tools like Miro or Mural.
