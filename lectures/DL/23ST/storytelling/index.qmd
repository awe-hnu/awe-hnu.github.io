# Storytelling and leadership {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Leadership

> A leader "is is one or more people who selects, equips, trains, and influences one or more follower(s) who have diverse gifts, abilities, and skills and **focuses the follower(s) to the organization's mission and objectives, causing the follower(s) to willingly and enthusiastically expend spiritual, emotional, and physical energy** in a concerted coordinated effort to achieve the organizational mission and objectives." @winston2006integrative[*p. 8*]

Management is about coping with complexity.\
**Leadership is about coping with change** [@kotter2017leaders].

::: notes
Management brings order and predictability to a situation. But that's no longer enough---to succedd, companies must be able to adapt to change. Leadership then, is about learning ho to cope with rapid change [@kotter2017leaders].

-   Management involves planning and budgeting. Leadership involves setting direction.
-   Management involves organizing and staffing. Leadership involves aligning people.
-   Management provides control and solves problems. Leadership provides motivation.

## Storytelling

How will you inspire others to be part of your vision if you can't communicate it?

Storytelling is a necessity of leadership.

## The power of good stories

> I've learned that the ability to articulate your story or that of your company is crucial in almost every phase of enterprise management. @guber2007four

#### Examples:

::: incremental
-   A great salesperson knows how to tell a story in which the product is the hero.
-   A successful line manager can rally the team to extraordinary efforts through a story that shows how short-term sacrifice leads to long-term success.
-   An effective CEO uses an emotional narrative about the company's mission to attract investors and partners, to set lofty goals, and to inspire employees.
-   Sometimes, a well-crafted story can even transform a seemingly hopeless situation into an unexpected triumph.

## The leader as storyteller

Truth at the tribal fire

::: incremental
-   Storytelling has always been also about instructing and leading
-   Great storytelling does not conflict with truth
:::

::: notes
It was he who recorded the oral history of the tribe, encoding its beliefs, values, and rules in the tales of its great heroes, of its triumphs and tragedies. The life-or-death lessons necessary to perpetuate the community's survival were woven into these stories: "We don't go hunting in the Great Wood---not since that terrible day when three of our bravest were killed there by unknown beasts. Here's how it happened ..." [@guber2007four]

Great storytelling does not conflict with truth. In the business world and elsewhere, it is always built on the integrity of the story and its teller. [@guber2007four].
:::

## Truth found in an effective story

@guber2007four distilled four kinds of truth found in an effective story:

::: {.larger .html-hidden}
[Teller, ]{.fragment}[audience,]{.fragment}\
[moment, ]{.fragment}[mission]{.fragment}
:::

::: incremental
-   **Truth to the teller** --- what a storyteller says must be consistent in their heart and mind
-   **Truth to the audience** --- the storyteller has to understand and recognize and what the audience wants and needs and address those wants and needs
-   **Truth to the moment** --- a storyteller adapts a story to the context in which the story is told
-   **Truth to the mission** --- a storyteller is "devoted to a cause beyond self."
:::

::: notes
Adapting to the audience and moment demands **behavioral complexity**.

# Exercise {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Get people behind you

Imagine you work as an internal consultant at *edding* and you have developed a first-class innovation: a whiteboard marker that always works (e.g. because it has a built-in sensor that tells you when it is dry and a canister that makes recycling easier).

. . .

You have the opportunity to pitch the idea to the CEO and his board. You want to convince them to take a leap of faith and support your idea.

. . .

Form small teams of max. 2 students together, think of a story you want to tell and write it down. Be ready to perform it.

# Structure {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Aristotle's three modes of persuasion

::: larger
Ethos, pathos, logos
:::

::: incremental
-   **Logos** appeals to the audience's reason, building up logical arguments.
-   **Ethos** appeals to the status or authority so that listeners are more likely to trust the speaker.
-   **Pathos** appeals to the emotions, e.g., trying to make the audience feel angry or sympathetic.
:::

::: notes
**Telling good stories includes:**

-   Thinking up in advance exactly what arguments can be made both for and against a given proposition, selecting the best on your own side, and finding counterarguments to those on the other.
-   You need to be clear about what your audience needs to know (or believe, which is the same thing in rhetoric) in order to understand that you are trustworthy, that you have the right to speak on the subject and that you are speaking in good faith. Your audience needs to believe that you are "a pretty honest guy".
-   Finding ways to drive your argument it forward. This is the stuff of your arguments, the way one point proceeds to another, as if to show that the conclusion to which you are aiming is not only the right one, but so necessary and reasonable as to be more or less the only one.

## Story structure

Behind really good stories is a well thought-out structure that forms the backbone of the story. This backbone, called the story elements, help writers develop great stories. The essential elements of a story are:

[Characters]{.fragment} \
[Setup or conflict]{.fragment} \
[Sequence of events (plot)]{.fragment} \
[Resolution]{.fragment}

## Narrative map - general structure

::: notes
Narrative maps consist of several important elements that make it easier to explain messages and give them clarity and context.

-   **Focus**: This is the central part of a narrative. It is comparable to a headline that explains and highlights the core of the story. Is the focus about innovation, change, competition or something else?
-   **Conflict or challenge**: What is the challenge, conflict or problem in the market that your company is dealing with? Why does this problem exist? Who is contributing to it? This begins to isolate the main problem within the story.
-   **Opportunity**: What is the impact or opportunity for your organisation? This is what some people call an unmet need or an aha moment. This is something you can use to bring about change or to address and solve a problem.
-   **Approach**: How does your story unfold? What are the three or four characters or key elements? What is the how, where and when?
-   **Resolution**: All good stories have an ending or conclusion. How do you resolve the build-up from the beginning? Let's say your story is about innovation and there are four ways the company will create something new. What is the benefit to a customer, an employee, the industry or the community? Where does this story end? Who sees the benefits?
