# Introduction {background-color="#dee3e9" background-image="../assets/engagement.jpg"}

> Managers must establish anew their credibility as managers able to get things done through others. They have to understand and develop new sources of power and influence if they are going to be able to defend their groups' interests. Thus, in an important sense, they must become "political"—i.e., understand the political dynamics of organizations and build the power and influence necessary to navigate them. *@hill2003becoming [p. 272]*

Does leadership require **the art of politics**?   
If so, what do you associate with it?

> Many new managers erroneously believe that the "powerful" are those in more senior positions, because they equate power simply with formal authority *@hill2003becoming [p. 272]*

## On power and politics

Organizations can be seen as both, **cooperative systems** of employees working together to achieve goals and **political arenas** of individuals and groups with differing interests [@brass2017intraorganizational].

. . .

**Power** can be defined as the ability to get other people to do what you want them to do, **politics** as *power in action*, using a range of techniques and tactics [@buchanan2020power].

. . .


Power and politics is at the heart of how organizations function [@hill2003becoming]. 

. . .

Though, often associated with negative connotations, @buchanan2020power shows that the view of the damaging, negative consequences of politics is too narrow. Politics can be both ‘functional’ and ‘dysfunctional’.

## Power and leadership

Other things being equal, political conflict increases with increasing interdependence, diversity, and resource scarcity [@pfeffer1992managing].

. . .

> Managers who ignore or fail to understand how power and influence work in organizations will find that they and their teams experience difficulty in being effective and ethical in their work. *@hill2003becoming [p. 273]*

. . .

Development of competing coalitions and periods of organizational crisis exacerbate political conflict, while leadership and shared value help to reduce the amount of conflict [@hill2003becoming].

. . .

Leaders need to define a vision that aligns and motivates people, creates shared values, and a shared culture—these are critical mechanisms for managing the increased diversity and interpedendence in organizations today.


## Political conflict in organizations

> Discovering that formal authority is a very limited source of power, new managers must find other ways to get thinkgs done [...] they soon learn that power and influence are the meachnisms by which the inevitable political conflicts in organizations get resolved. *@hill2003becoming [p. 274]*

If it is not a formal authority, what are the main sources of power?
:::

## Personal and positional characteristics

#### Sources of personal power [@hill2003becoming, p. 276]

:::{.incremental}
- **Expertise**: relevant knowledge and skills
- **Track record**: relevant experience
- **Attractiveness**: attributes that others find appealing and identify with
- **Effort**: expenditure of time and energy
:::

#### Sources of positional power [@hill2003becoming, p. 276]

:::{.incremental}
- **Formal authority**: position in hierarchy and prescribed responsibilities
- **Relevance**: relationship between task and organizational objectives
- **Centrality**: position in key networks
- **Autonomy**: amount of discretion in a position
- **Visibility**: degree to which performance can be seen by others
:::

Why is a strong, well-developed network a meaningful source of power?
:::

## Building key relationships

Companies are increasingly required to engage in cross-organizational work (across levels, functions, geographies) in an effort to improve their capacities to execute and innovate.

. . . 

Leaders need to build and maintain key relationships to identify changes in the priorities and needs of these groups and prepare their field for new opportunities and threats—**a strong, well-developed network** can provide the kind of big picture information needed in today's world [@brass2012power].

. . .

It is, thus, required to **identify dependencies**^[Dependencies can be analyzed by asking questions such as *On whom am I dependent, and who depends on me?*], to **take into account the political dynamics** that make for potential sources of conflict^[Political dynamics can be understood by asking, e.g., *What differences exist between me and the people on whom I am dependent? What sources of power do I have to influence this relationship?], and to invest time and energy in **building and maintaining relationships** with those on whom the team is dependent^[Questions like *What can be done to cultivate or repair the relationship?* help to cultivate relationships] [@hill2003becoming].

> It is always better to overestimate rather than underestimate dependencies. *@hill2003becoming*
