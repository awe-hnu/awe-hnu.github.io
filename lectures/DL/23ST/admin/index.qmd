# Motivation

:::{.notes}
Society often associates leaders with individuals that have grandiose titles, a large corner office, and make world-changing decisions. Thus, many people shy away from identifying themselves as a leader. However, real leadership can be seen most clearly in the small moments throughout the day. 

> Leadership is about behaving in a way that makes the life of another person better than before you arrived. *Drew Dudley*

# General remarks

This module helps you to deepen your understanding of the requirements of leadership in the digital age ‚Äî from leading oneself, to leading employees and leading systems.

To achieve that, you will read a bunch of **scientific papers**, apply some of the findings in **(group) exercises** and, best case, reflect your own behavior.
