# General remarks

This module helps you to deepen your understanding of the requirements of leadership in the digital age â€” from leading oneself, to leading employees and leading systems.

To show your leadership skills and demonstrate what you have learnt, you will research a leadership topic, explain it to the class, develop an exercise, motivate us to apply our knowledge, give direction and lead the exercise.
