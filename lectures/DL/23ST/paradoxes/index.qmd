# Paradoxes in leadership {background-color="#1e576b" background-image="../assets/paradox.jpg"}

> Leadership requires the capacity to **recognize** and **react** to paradox, contradiction, and complexity. *@denison1995paradox*

:::{.notes}
Traditional management theories have often presented organizational phenomena in terms of **discrete, opposing categories** (e.g., Theory X and Theory Y, transactional and transformational leadership). In contrast, more recent theorizing has placed greater emphasis on paradox[^1], contradiction, and complexity, suggesting that many phenomexna may in fact fit **multiple opposing categories simultaneously**.

While not denying the underlying discrete categories, this more complex perspective implies that effective leaders are those who have the cognitive and behavioral **capacity to recognize and react to paradox, contradiction, and complexity in their environments** [@denison1995paradox]. Particularly when considering that **paradox is fundamental to contemporary work contexts** characterized by globalization, technological change, and increased competition [@lavine2014paradoxical].
:::

[^1]: A paradox can be defined as a set of mutually inconsistent propositions, each of which seems true [@rescher2004paradoxes].

What is **ambidexterity**, what is **behavioral complexity**?
:::

## Ambidexterity

Ambidexterity refers to "an organization's capacity to address two organizationally incompatible objectives equally well" [@birkinshaw2013clarifying , p. 291]

. . .

The ability of senior leadership teams to embrace tension between old states and activities and new ones is a key predictor of firm success [@tushman2011ambidextrous].

::: larger
> It takes complexity to defeat complexity. *@uhl2007complexity [p. 301]*
:::

## Behavioral complexity

Increasing social and organizational complexity requires **cognitive complexity** and **behavioral complexity** --- "we must conceive and perform" [@denison1995paradox, p. 524].

. . .

Effective leaders are those who have the cognitive as well as the behavioral capacity to recognize **and** react to paradox, contradiction, and complexity in their environments [@denison1995paradox; @lawrence2009behavioral; @spreitzer1996empowering].

. . .

Considering behavioral complexity, effective leadership can be defined as "the ability to perform the multiple roles and behaviors that circumscribe the requisite variety implied by an organizational or environmental context" [@denison1995paradox, p. 526].

The creator of the competing values framework (CVF), @quinn1988beyond argues that top managers and leaders are better able to recognize and deal with contradictions and paradoxes that often manifest themselves in the form of conflict, unconstructive conversations and misalignment of leadership and management capacity with an organisation's strategic challenges. He identified multiple competing demands and views between members within the organization and across various levels of the organization. He showed that these reflect different values of individuals and often different cultures which had become embedded in parts of and across organizations. @quinn1988beyond set out his attempt to develop an integrating framework that could capture these in a meaningful way, with different mixes of paradoxes and contradictions at each point in time, and to show how individuals and organisations could better appreciate the circumstances and move forward.

@quinn1988beyond distilled the competing values in a framework with two dimensions and resulting four quadrants. The dimensions express the tensions or competing values that characterize all organisations. One axis represents the continuum between flexibility or adaptability and stability or control. The other axis describes the continuum between efficient internal processes, such as human resource practices or internal control systems, and external positioning vis-à-vis stakeholders such as competitors, customers and clients. Each continuum highlights performance criteria that are opposite to the other end of the continuum, such as internal versus external alignment (horizontal axis) or flexibility versus stability (vertical axis).

The main characteristics of the **clan culture**, so called because it resembles a family-like orientation, include empowerment, team building and employee participation; the main characteristics of the **adhocracy culture** include adaptability, creativity and risk-taking; this type of culture is often found in innovative industries. The main characteristics of **hierarchy culture** include standardisation, predictability and multiple levels of management; the authors suggest that this type of culture is usually found in government agencies. Finally, @cameron2011diagnosing suggest that **market culture**, with its characteristic outward orientation and competitive attitude, is often found in organisations operating in unstable and crowded operating environments. 

The four orientations are intuitively appealing, perhaps confirming their origin in psychological archetypes; most people can probably find the culture of their current organisation somewhere in this taxonomy. However, as the academic labels for thein each quadrant are often misunderstood, it has proven useful to substitute more accessible and commonly used verbs to describe the dominant activities that relate to each culture—*collaborate*, *create*, *compete*, and *control* [@lavine2014paradoxical].

The model further groups two of the leadership roles in each of the four quadrants. The upper right quadrant, which the framework links to open systems theory and the process of adapting to the external environment of the organisation, defines two leadership roles:

- The **innovator** is creative and surrounds, encourages and facilitates change. 
- The **broker** is politically astute, acquires resources and maintains the external legitimacy of the entity by building, scanning and maintaining a network of external contacts. 

Moving clockwise to the lower right quadrant, two other leadership roles are specified. These roles emphasize the rational pursuit of goals that are external to the group and the role of the leader in defining and motivating the achievement of these goals. 

- The **producer** is the task-oriented, work-driven role. The producer seeks closure and motivates the behaviors that lead to the completion of the group task
- The **director** sets goals, clarifies the role, sets targets and formulates clear expectations. 

The lower left quadrant is called the internal process model and focuses on internal control and stability. Two additional leadership roles are defined in this quadrant:

- The **coordinator** maintains the structure, plans, coordinates and resolves problems, and ensures compliance with rules and standards. 
- The **monitor** collects and distributes information, reviews performance and ensures continuity and stability.

The upper left quadrant is referred to in the framework as the human relations quadrant, which focuses on human interaction and process. Within this quadrant, two final leadership roles are defined:

- The **facilitator** encourages the expression of opinions, seeks consensus and negotiates compromises.
- The **mentor** is aware of individual needs, actively listens, is fair, supports legitimate concerns and seeks to promote the development of the individual.

## How should leaders communicate? {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color="black"}

::: larger
How should leaders **communicate**?
:::

For each quadrant, discuss how presentation communication should be designed to be effective. For each quadrant, name at least 3 adjectives that describe leadership communication.
*Group work, 10 minutes*

## Communication

![A competing values model of managerial communication according to @quinn1991competing](images/communication.svg){#fig-communication.svg}

:::{.notes}
By analyzing presentational communication in management contexts using the CVF, @quinn1991competing draw following conclusions: A message characterized by a criterion in one quadrant without a trace of the opposite criterion in another quadrant may be ineffective. For example, a presentation that scores well on all the descriptors associated with the information communication quadrant but has none of the characteristics associated with the transformative communication quadrant may be so boring and monotonous that it attracts virtually no attention. Presentations of may have more features from one quadrant than others. In short, effective presentations should have a combination a combination of features from all quadrants.

## Paradoxes in digital leadership {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color="black"}

::: larger
What are **digital leadership** paradoxes?
:::

Identify paradoxes that are specific to the digital age and locate them in the CVF.
Think, e.g., if digital technologies facilitate and/or demand specific leadership roles, while the environment (e.g., organization, markets, etc.) demand others.
Please discuss also if digital tools might not only increase but also help to mitigate paradoxes and contradictions and help to deal with complexity. 
*Group work, 20 minutes*

## Implications

> Complex situations require complex responses. Sometimes organizations benefit from stability, and sometimes they benefit from change. Often organizations need both stability and change at the same time. In contrast to earlier approaches, the development of the competing values framework did not assume that stability and change were mutually exclusive, an either/or decision. @quinn2020becoming[*p. 12*]

. . .

Leadership qualities seem to be best demonstrated by **more movement throughout the framework**, suggesting complex adaptation to changing circumstances [@denison1995paradox].

. . .

The CVF provides a description of roles and behaviors to encourage self-reflection and to provide a preliminary sense of behaviors and accompanying roles that can be *learned*.

. . .

Working to **overcome areas of relative weakness** so that they can be **transformed into average or adequate performance** can help leaders see more opportunities for action when core areas of strength are not delivering the desired results.
