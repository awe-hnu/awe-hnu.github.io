Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. 
:::

:::{.notes}
The Big Five traits have been found to be relevant to many aspects of life, such as subjective well-being [e.g., @deneve1998happy] and even longevity [@friedman1995childhood]. They also provide a valuable taxonomy for the study of leadership [@judge2002personality].

What are these traits about?
:::

## Traits

**Neuroticism** represents the tendency to exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative affects, such as anxiety, insecurity, and hostility.

**Extraversion** represents the tendency to be sociable, assertive, active, and to experience positive affects, such as energy and zeal. 

**Openness to Experience** is the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous. 

**Agreeableness** is the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle. 

**Conscientiousness** is comprised of two related facets: achievement and dependability.

## Relation to leadership

![Regression of Leadership on Big Five Traits according to the meta study of @judge2002personality](images/leadershipBigFive.svg){#fig-bigFive fig-align="left"}

::: {.notes}

The meta-analysis of @judge2002personality shows that:

- The Big Five typology is a fruitful basis for examining the dispositional predictors of leadership.
- **Extraversion** is the most important trait of leaders and effective leadership.
- Extraversion is more strongly related to leader emergence than to leader effectiveness.
- After Extraversion, **Conscientiousness** and **Openness to Experience** were the strongest and most consistent correlates of leadership. 
- Conscientiousness ist more strongly related to leader emergence than to leadership effectiveness.
- Agreeableness was the least relevant trait.
- Neuroticism failed to emerge as a significant predictor of leadership.
- Overall, the traits are better predictors in situations in which individuals have only limited opportunity to observe leadership behaviors (i.e., student samples).

However, the results may simply indicate a close correspondence between the way we see people’s personalities and our stereotypical conceptions of the characteristics of leaders.

Which of the traits seems to be important for the digital era?

# Emergence of traits

Traits have a **genetic source** and are the result of **adaptive processes** (i.e., fitness, reproduction, survival) [@judge2009bright].

:::{.incremental}
- Compared to differences in genes, differences in environment appear to play a smaller role in the variability of socially desirable (e.g., exercise, altruism) and undesirable (e.g., drug use, crime) behaviors
- "Leaders are born", as identical twins raised apart show striking similarities in the emergence of leadership personalities
- 50% of personality is heritable (that doesn’t mean 50% is environmental)

What has been the most surprising insight for you so far?
:::

# Emotional intelligence

Intelligence is the most “successful” trait in social and applied psychology [@judge2009bright].

. . .

@goleman2004makes argues that it is not IQ (intelligence, a trait), but **emotional intelligence** that sets apart great leaders.

. . .

Emotional intelligence is a group of **five skills** that enable the best leaders to maximize their own and their followers' performance:

:::{.incremental}
- **Self-awareness**—knowing one's strenghts, weaknesses, drives, values, and impact on others
- **Self-regulation**—controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods
- **Motivation**—relishing achievements for its own sake
- **Empathy**—understanding other people's emotional makeup and treating them according to their emotional reactions
- **Social skill**—building rapport with others to move them in decired directions

Read @goleman2004makes and summarize the characteristics of one skill, its importance and pathways to strengthen it.

Also discuss if the skill is gaining importance in the digital era and why (not).

# Q&A {.html-hidden .unlisted background-color=blue}

# Homework

Read @lavine2014paradoxical and answer following questions:

- What is ambidexterity, behavioral complexity?
- Why does a complex world require behavioral complexity?
- Which leadership paradoxes are identified by the CVF? Can you give specific examples for each?
- How do the paradoxes relate to the specifics of the digital era?
