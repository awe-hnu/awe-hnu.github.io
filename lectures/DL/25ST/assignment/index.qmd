# Assignment 

:::html-hidden
:::medium
[You **portray a leader** ]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[and **introduce a theory** ]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[to **critically reflect** on the behavior and outcomes of the leader ]{.fragment .fade-in}
[by means of a **20 minutes presentation** ]{.fragment .fade-in}
[and **5 minutes discussion**.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::
:::

::: notes
Your task is to **portray a leader** of the digital age and **critically discuss her or his leadership**. 

The portrait of the leader needs to be based on publicly available data and/or originally collected data and must be comprehensible without prior knowledge of the person. The discussion must be based on a theory related of leadership or organizational behavior. The theory needs to be introduced and then used to develop explanations of the leader's behavior and the observable outcomes. Your presentation ends with theoretically grounded conclusions and recommendations for yourself and your fellow students.

The **presentation** should take at min 18 minutes and at max 20 minutes and is followed by a critical discussion (5 to 10 minutes).
:::

## Leaders

::: medium
To avoid duplication, you must [propose a shortlist of two to three leaders]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} you would like to portray. 
[I will then assign you a leader from your shortlist.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

::: notes
If you do not propose a shortlist or if there are too many duplicates, I will assign a leader you will portray. For deadlines see [schedule](../admin/#schedule).

# Grading

An **excellent presentation** has the following characteristics

:::{.incremental}
- The leader is comprehensibly portrayed. 
- The presentation conveys a **deep understanding of the theory**.
- The data on which the portrait is based is transparent.
- The theoretical foundation is based on **scientific literature**.
- The theoretical explanations presented are comprehensible.
- The theory helps us understand why leaders behave the way they do\
  and what happens as a result.
- The conclusions drawn flow logically and make sense.

## Bonus points

:::large
You can earn **bonus points**.[^Bonus]
:::

. . .

The extra points you get are based on how well you contribute to the exercises and discussions about the presentations of your fellow students, compared to the other students.

. . .

The bonus points can improve your performance by up to two grade increments (up to .7).

[^Bonus]: The bonus points are only taken into account when determining the module grade if it results in a better module grade and the original module grade is at least "4.0". For details, please see the general examination regulations of the HNU (*APO*).

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum. 
:::

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` — very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` — good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a “good performance”.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an “average   performance”*                                                                                             |
| `3` — satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` — sufficient             | [A   performance that “still adequately satisfies” the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` — not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}                                                                                                                                  |

# Literature search

There are several ways of searching literature for your theoretical foundations. I recommend using the [Web of Science](http://webofknowledge.com.ezproxy.hnu.de/) or [Google Scholar](http://ezproxy.hnu.de/login?url=https://scholar.google.de) search engines.

. . .

Additional recommendations 
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Use the citation count as primary quality indicator (rule of thumb: the more cited, the more significant is the paper).
- For understanding the theory try to follow the conversation (start with early, introductory papers and then read more recent papers).
- Look for literature reviews that summarize the current state of knowledge.
- For finding recent empirical evidence look for papers that apply the theory.
