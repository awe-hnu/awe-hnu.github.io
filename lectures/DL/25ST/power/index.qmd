## Power in organizations


Organizations can be seen [as both, **cooperative systems** of employees working together to achieve goals]{.fragment} [and **political arenas** of individuals and groups with differing interests [@brass2017intraorganizational].]{.fragment}

. . .

**Power** can be defined as the ability to get other people to do what you want them to do, **politics** as *power in action*, using a range of techniques and tactics [@buchanan2020power].

. . .


Power and politics is at the heart of how organizations function [@hill2003becoming]. 

. . .

Though, often associated with negative connotations, @buchanan2020power shows that the view of the damaging, negative consequences of politics is too narrow. Politics can be both ‘functional’ and ‘dysfunctional’.

## Power and leadership

Other things being equal, political conflict increases with growing interdependence, diversity, and resource scarcity [@pfeffer1992managing].

. . .

> Managers who ignore or fail to understand how power and influence work in organizations will find that they and their teams experience difficulty in being effective and ethical in their work. *@hill2003becoming [p. 273]*

. . .

Development of competing coalitions and periods of organizational crisis[^coalitions] exacerbate political conflict, while leadership and shared value help to reduce the amount of conflict [@hill2003becoming].

[^coalitions]: Competing coalitions represent what happens when 'organizational seams’ (i.e., interfaces or boundaries between distinct units) become battlegrounds — different departments or teams develop their own agendas, priorities, and cultures - creating friction at the seams. Organizational crises can intensify these seam problems as departments protect their interests during uncertainty or resource constraints.

. . .

Leaders need to define a vision that aligns and motivates people, creates shared values, and a shared culture—these are critical mechanisms for managing the increased diversity and interpedendence in organizations today.

[**Sources of positional power** [@hill2003becoming, p. 276]]{.h4}

:::{.incremental}
- **Formal authority**: position in hierarchy and prescribed responsibilities
- **Relevance**: relationship between task and organizational objectives
- **Centrality**: position in key networks
- **Autonomy**: amount of discretion in a position
- **Visibility**: degree to which performance can be seen by others

Why is a strong, well-developed network a meaningful source of power?
:::

Relate your answers to the social capital theory.

## Building key relationships

Companies are increasingly required to engage in cross-organizational work (across levels, functions, geographies) in an effort to improve their capacities to execute and innovate.

. . . 

Leaders need to build and maintain key relationships to identify changes in the priorities and needs of these groups and prepare their field for new opportunities and threats—**a strong, well-developed network** can provide the kind of big picture information needed in today's world [@brass2012power].

. . .

According to @hill2003becoming, effective leadership requires to

:::incremental
- **identify dependencies**^[Dependencies can be analyzed by asking questions such as *On whom am I dependent, and who depends on me?*]
- **take into account the political dynamics** that make for potential sources of conflict^[Political dynamics can be understood by asking, e.g., *What differences exist between me and the people on whom I am dependent? What sources of power do I have to influence this relationship?*]
- **build and maintaining relationships** with those on whom the team is dependent^[Questions like *What can be done to cultivate or repair the relationship?* help to cultivate relationships]

## History {visibility=hidden}

The concept of social capital has been relative independently introduced by scholars from various disciplines at different times.

:::notes
Seminal works particularly originate from 

- James Coleman (1988) on the topic of education/utilisation of human capital (e.g., @coleman1988social)
- Robert Putman (1993) on social participation (e.g., @putnam2000bowling)
- Pierre Bourdieu (1983) on the relationship between economic, cultural and social capital (e.g., @bourdieu1986forms)
- Ronald Burt (1982) on social networks (e.g., @burt2018structural)
:::

Since the 1990s the concept of social capital found its way into organizational and management sciences to explain e.g.

:::incremental
- value creation in intrafirm networks [@tsai1998social],
- creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social],
- productivity of R&D teams [@reagans2001networks], 
- project performance [@di2012social], and
- business-IT alignment [@wagner2014social].

## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color="black"}

:::large
How can social capital be defined?
:::

## Definitions

> Social capital is defined by its function. It is not a single entity, but a variety of different entities having two characteristics in common: They all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals who are within the structure. Like other forms of capital, social capital is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that would not be attainable in its absence *@coleman1988social [p. 98]*

. . .

> ... features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefits *@putnam1993prosperous [p. 67]*

------

> ... the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance or recognition *@bourdieu1986forms [p. 21]*

. . .

> ... the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or an social unit. Social capital thus comprises both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network. *@nahapiet1998social [p. 243]*

## Similarities and distinctions

The definitions of social capital share some similarities and distinctions:

:::incremental
- There is an emphasis on the **structure of social relations** (networks)
- Social capital is seen as **a resource for action** (individual goal achievement)
- The **level of analysis** stems from macro-level (e.g., societies) to meso/micro-level (e.g., organizations and groups)
- The **causal structure** of social capital is conceived differently\
  - Networks as source of social capital; social capital is a result of network embeddedness [e.g., @bourdieu1986forms; @coleman1988social].
  - The network of relations is equivalent to social capital [e.g., @putnam1993prosperous; @nahapiet1998social].
:::

## Strong vs. weak ties

:::fragment
@coleman1988social argues that cohesion, that is to say the **strength of the relationship between actors**, is the source of social capital (*strong ties*)
:::

:::incremental
- Cohesion facilitates the creation of social norms, trust and sanctions within networks, which safeguard against opportunistic behavior 
- Cohesion enables coordination and increases willingness of actors to engage in knowledge exchange (*bonding*)
:::

:::fragment
@burt2018structural posits that social capital rather emerges from **opportunities to bridge disconnections** or non-equivalencies separating non-redundant sources of information (*structural holes*) 
:::

:::incremental
- Structural holes (i.e. ‘weak ties’) provide the opportunity to get access to diverse sets of perspectives, skills, or resources.
- Social capital emerges from structurally favorable positions between different group of actors (*bridging*)
:::

Structural dimension
: The structural dimension reflects *“the overall pattern of connections between actors”* [@nahapiet1998social, p. 244] — the possibilities of actors to interact with others (‘physical’ ties)

Relational dimension
: The relational dimension *“relates to the nature and quality of the relationships among team members”* [@robert2008social, p. 319] — the relational strength of ties (trust, respect, norms, identification) 

Cognitive dimension
: The cognitive dimension refers to *“those resources providing shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning among parties”* [@nahapiet1998social, p. 244] — the ability to communicate and effectively access resources

:::

## Value

The ultimate value of a given form of social capital is context-dependent [@adler2002social].

[Strong ties]{.medium .link-color .fragment}\
[Effective search for novel information\
(competitive rivalry, certain tasks, individual contribution)]{.fragment}

[Weak ties]{.medium .link-color .fragment}\
[Effective transfer of information and tacit knowledge\
(collective goals, uncertain tasks, group contribution)]{.fragment}

:::fragment
The value is further dependent on the availability of complementary resources (e.g., combination capability)

Opportunities
: The social network creates opportunities for social capital transactions to leverage external resources (*bridging*) and to act together (*bonding*) [@adler2002social].

Motivation
: Contact’s motivation determines the share of potential resources. Motivation reflects the willingness to define and act on collective goals caused by shared interests, common identity, and commitment to the common good [@adler2002social].

Ability
: If social relations are mobilized is contingent on resources that enables actors to mobilize their social relations (e.g. shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning) [@adler2002social].

According to @adler2002social conceptual model, context plays a critical role in determining the value of social capital. They propose that the value of social capital is not universal or fixed but rather contingent on specific contextual factors. This contextual perspective is significant because it challenges simplistic views that social capital is universally beneficial. Instead, Adler and Kwon emphasize that the value of social capital is situational and dependent on these contextual factors, which helps explain why similar network structures or relationships might yield different outcomes in different settings.

:::notes

Leadership in modern organizations extends far beyond formal authority. As you develop in your leadership journey, consider these key insights:

- **Recognize that power is multifaceted** — while formal authority is limited, effective leaders cultivate diverse sources of power—both personal (expertise, track record, effort) and positional (relevance, centrality, visibility).
** Embrace productive politics** — politics isn't inherently negative but rather "power in action." Skilled leaders engage in organizational politics functionally, using influence techniques to navigate interdependencies and resolve conflicts constructively.
- **Manage organizational seams** — pay particular attention to the interfaces between departments and units, as these are where political conflicts often emerge. Your ability to reduce friction at these seams directly impacts organizational effectiveness.
- **Invest strategically in social capital** — your network is a critical resource. Understand that the value of relationships is context-dependent—sometimes strong, cohesive ties are beneficial; other times, weak ties that bridge structural holes provide greater advantage.
  - Apply the opportunity-motivation-ability framework from Adler and Kwon to develop relationships that provide access to resources, information, and support across organizational boundaries.
  - Create alignment through shared values. Use your influence to foster a common vision that can overcome the natural political tensions arising from diversity and interdependence.

Remember that effective leadership requires constant attention to dependencies and relationships. As you progress, continuously reevaluate your sources of power, nurture your network, and adapt your political strategies to changing contexts. In the end, your effectiveness will be judged not by your formal position but by your ability to exercise influence across organizational boundaries.
