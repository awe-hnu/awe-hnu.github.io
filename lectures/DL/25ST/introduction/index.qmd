What is leadership?

## Quote {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

> A leader ... is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind. *Nelson Mandela*

## Leadership 

> [One or more people]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[who selects, equips, trains, and influences]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[one or more follower(s) who have diverse gifts, abilities, and skills and ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[focuses the follower(s) to the organization’s mission and objectives ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[causing the follower(s) to willingly and enthusiastically expend spiritual, emotional, and physical energy in a concerted coordinated effort ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[to achieve the organizational mission and objectives. *@winston2006integrative [p. 8]*]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

## Management

:::medium
**Management** is about coping with **complexity**, [while **leadership** is about coping with **change** [@kotter2017leaders]]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::notes
Management brings order and predictability to a situation. But that's no longer enough—to succeed, companies must be able to adapt to change. Leadership then, is about learning ho to cope with rapid change [@kotter2017leaders].

- Management involves planning and budgeting.\
  Leadership involves **setting direction**.
- Management involves organizing and staffing.\
  Leadership involves **aligning people**.
- Management provides control and solves problems.\
  Leadership involves **providing motivation**.

Why to speak about *digital* leadership?

::: large
What is specific about the digital age?
:::

## Context of leadership

The digital age is coined by digital technologies (e.g., *S*ocial media, *M*obile computing, *A*nalytics/big data, *C*loud computing — SMAC) that are **inherently disruptive** and that that cause **major changes**. [@karimi2015role].

. . .

@verhoef2021digital identifies **three phases of these disruptive changes**:    
digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation.

:::incremental
- **Digitization** is the "the process of converting analog signals into a digital form, and ultimately into binary digits (bits)" [@tilson2010research, p. 749].
- **Digitalization** is "a sociotechnical process of applying digitizing techniques to broader social and institutional contexts" [@tilson2010research, p. 749].
- **Digital transformation** is "a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies” [@vial2019understanding, p. 118].

### Disruptive potential

Digital technologies do not develop linearly, but **exponentially**, [which is leading to **significant changes** in peoples behavior, attitudes, and expectations.]{.fragment .fade-in}

:::notes
Digital technologies do not develop linearly, but **exponentially** [@schreckling2017digitalize]:

- Hardware becomes ever more powerful, small, and thus ubiquitous (Moore's Law[^Moore]).
- As every consumer and every machine (‘Things’) is able to be connected, established (rules of) individual and organizational behavior are disrupted (i.e., hyper connectivity)
- Network effects lead to a **superlinear increase** in value by connecting systems, processes, and users (Metcalfe’s law[^Metcalfe]).
- Comparatively low barriers to entry

This fuels and is fueled by changes in peoples behavior, attitudes, and expectations, e.g., 

- The speed with which people adopt new technologies
- The urge to use connected devices to take action on whatever we need or want right now

> We’re not going online, we’re living online. *Jerry Dischler, VP of AdWords Product Management at Google*

[^Moore]: Moore’s law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years
[^Metcalfe]: Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system

### Acceleration of VUCA

:::large

[Volatility]{.fragment .fade-in}      
[Uncertainty]{.fragment .fade-in}      
[Complexity]{.fragment .fade-in}      
[& Ambiguity]{.fragment .fade-in}

:::

:::notes

The term VUCA was introduced by the US Army War College to describe a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment. It was first used by the Pentagon to describe the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. A few years later it was used by strategic business leaders to describe the chaotic, turbulent and rapidly changing business environment that has become the 'new reality' [@VUCAqrm].

Characteristic of a VUCA environment is not so much the disruptive upheavals caused by (digital) technology, but rather the speed and scale of disruption specific to the **digital age**.

- **Volatility** can be defined as the nature, speed, volume and magnitude of change that does not follow a predictable pattern [@sullivan2012vuca]. This is turbulence; a phenomenon that is occurring more frequently and more rapidly than in the past. Typically, market demand in many businesses was already increasingly volatile and unpredictable before the Corona virus crisis, and will be even more so after the containment.
- **Uncertainty** can be seen as the lack of predictability of issues and events [@sullivan2012vuca]. Past issues and events cannot be used to predict future outcomes due to volatility. As a result, forecasting becomes extremely difficult and decision making very challenging for most executives.
- **Complexity** is the difficulty in understanding the causes and mitigating factors (both inside and outside the organisation) involved in a problem [@sullivan2012vuca]. The layer of complexity, added to the turbulence of change and the absence of past predictors, adds to the difficulty of decision making and leads to confusion.
- **Ambiguity** is the result of the confusion mentioned above. The lack of clarity about the meaning of the change slows down the decision making process to the point of freezing the status quo [@sullivan2012vuca]..

## Digital leadership

Digital technology has changed and is changing organizations' structure, work environment, processes and culture, in an irreversible way, **creating new challenges** that leaders have to face.

. . .

Organizational leaders must work to ensure that their organizations is capable of **responding to the disruptions** associated with the use of digital technologies and of responding to the changes [@vial2019understanding], e.g., by

:::incremental
- dissolving inertia and resistance to change,
- leading employees to assume roles that were traditionally outside of their functions,
- acting as boundary spanners that foster close collaboration between business and IT functions,
- depending on analytical skills to solve increasingly complex business problems,
- ensuring that digital technologies are properly leveraged (i.e., used).
:::

. . .

Digital leaders empower people with VUCA — **vision**, **understanding**, **clarity** and **agility**.
