The Big Five traits have been found to be relevant to many aspects of life, such as subjective well-being [e.g., @deneve1998happy] and even longevity [@friedman1995childhood]. They also provide a valuable taxonomy for the study of leadership [@judge2002personality].

- **Neuroticism** refers to the tendency to experience the world as stressful, threatening and uncertain.
- **Extraversion** refers to the tendency to be sociable, assertive, active, and to experience positive affects, such as energy and zeal.
- **Openness to Experience** is the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous.
- **Agreeableness** refers to the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle.
- **Conscientiousness** refers to the tendency to be responsible, organized, hard-working, goal-directed, and to adhere to norms and rules.

What traits **distinguish leaders** from other people?

## Relation to leadership

![Regression of Leadership on Big Five Traits according to the meta study of @judge2002personality](images/leadershipBigFive.svg){#fig-bigFive fig-align="left"}

::: notes
**Leadership effectiveness** refers to a leader's performance in influencing and guiding the activities of his or her unit toward achievement of its goals [@stogdill1950leadership].

**Leadership emergence** refers to whether (or to what degree) an individual is viewed as a leader by others, who typically have only limited information about that individual's performance [@hogan1994we].

Leadership effectiveness and emergence represent two levels of analysis. Leadership emergence is a within-group phenomenon. In contrast, leadership effectiveness represents a between-groups phenomenon.

Regarding these two constructs and personality trais, the meta-analysis of @judge2002personality shows that:

- The Big Five typology is a fruitful basis for examining the dispositional predictors of leadership.
- **Extraversion** is the most important trait of leaders and effective leadership.
- Extraversion is more strongly related to leader emergence than to leader effectiveness.
- **Extraversion**, **Conscientiousness** and **Openness to Experience** were the strongest and most consistent correlates of leadership.
- Conscientiousness ist more strongly related to leader emergence than to leadership effectiveness.
- **Agreeableness** was the least relevant trait.
- **Neuroticism** failed to emerge as a significant predictor of leadership.
- Overall, the traits are better predictors in situations in which individuals have only limited opportunity to observe leadership behaviors (i.e., student samples).

However, the results may simply indicate a close correspondence between the way we see peoples personalities and our stereotypical conceptions of the characteristics of leaders.

But, how do **traits emerge**?

# Emergence of traits

:::medium
Traits have a **genetic source** [and are the result of **adaptive processes** [@judge2009bright]{.smaller}.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

::: notes
-   Compared to differences in genes, differences in environment appear to play a smaller role in the variability of socially desirable (e.g., exercise, altruism) and undesirable (e.g., drug use, crime) behaviors
-   "Leaders are born", as identical twins raised apart show striking similarities in the emergence of leadership personalities
-   50% of personality is heritable (that doesn't mean 50% is environmental)

> "Asking how much a particular individual's attitudes or traits are due to heredity versus the environment is nonsensical, just like asking whether a leaky basement is caused more by the crack in the foundation or the water outside." @olson2001heritability [*pp. 845-846*]

![The Leader Trait Emergence Effectiveness (LTEE) model [@judge2009bright]](images/process.svg){#fig-process fig-align="left"}

Socioanalytic theory holds that individuals possess three primary motives:

-   getting along (communion, cooperation),
-   getting ahead (agency, competing), and
-   providing meaning (transformational, purpose).

The motives are closely linked to personality, such that agreeable individuals are motivated to get along with others, and conscientious and extraverted individuals are motivated to get ahead.

However, whether traits are related to leader emergence and leadership effectiveness may depend on the context and the adaptive processes. As adaptive and coordination problems increase, so does the importance of leadership. There is little need for prudent, courageous and flexible leadership when the collective faces little conflict from within or without.

Could it be that personality traits lead to an advantage under certain conditions, while another situation they become a serious disadvantage?

# Emotional intelligence

Intelligence is the most "successful" trait in social and applied psychology [@judge2009bright].

. . .

@goleman2004makes argues that it is not IQ (intelligence, a trait), but **emotional intelligence** that sets apart great leaders.

. . .

Emotional intelligence is a group of **five skills** that enable the best leaders to maximize their own and their followers' performance:

::: incremental
-   **Self-awareness**---knowing one's strenghts, weaknesses, drives, values, and impact on others
-   **Self-regulation**---controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods
-   **Motivation**---relishing achievements for its own sake
-   **Empathy**---understanding other people's emotional makeup and treating them according to their emotional reactions
-   **Social skill**---building rapport with others to move them in decired directions
:::

## Group work {.vertical-centered background-color="#afd5df"}

Read @goleman2004makes and summarize the characteristics of **one skill**.

Find an example, discuss its importance as well as pathways to strengthen it.

Also discuss if the skill is gaining importance in the digital era and why (not).

# Conclusion {background-color="black"}

::: large
> It is fortunate, then, that emotional intelligence can be learned. *@goleman2004makes*

::: notes
Learning might mean here being able to deal efficiently with our personality traits that have a genetic source.

# Q&A {.html-hidden .unlisted .headline-only}

# Homework

Read @lavine2014paradoxical and answer following questions:

- What is ambidexterity, what is behavioral complexity?
- Why does a complex world require behavioral complexity?
- Which leadership paradoxes are identified by the CVF?
  Can you give specific examples for each?
- How do the paradoxes relate to the specifics of the digital era?
