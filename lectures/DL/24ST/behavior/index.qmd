# Introduction {background-color="#cdd6d5"}

> Leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinate’s environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance. *@house1996path [p. 348]*

## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted background-color="black"}

::: medium
What have you learned about the path-goal theory?
:::

What is the **essence of the theory** and what **classes of leader behavior** does it specify?

# Path-goal theory {background-color="#cdd6d5"}

::: large
Leaders must guide and support their followers along the path to achieving their goals [[@house1996path].]{.smaller}
:::

::: notes
Path-goal theory emphasizes that leaders need to **clarify the paths to goals**, remove obstacles, and provide necessary support to help followers reach their objectives efficiently. It highlights the importance of **adapting leadership behaviors** to suit the needs of followers and the situation they are working in. Ultimately, the theory reminds leaders that their primary role is to coach and guide followers towards goal achievement by **selecting behaviors that best fit followers' needs and the working environment.**
:::

## Path-goal clarifying behaviors

The path-goal theory assumes that under conditions role and task demands that are ambiguous and intrinsically satisfying, goal-oriented behavior by superiors is helpful and instrumental to task performance. Thus, following things need to be clarified: 

:::incremental
- subordinates **performance goals**,
- the **means** by which subordinates can effectively carry out tasks, 
- the **standards** by which subordinate’s performance will be judged, 
- **expectancies** that others hold for subordinates to which the subordinate should and should not respond, and 
- judicious use of **rewards and punishment**, contingent on performance.

[Leaders' behavior complements subordinates' environments and abilities]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[& leaders' path-goal clarifying behavior adapts to different situations]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

:::notes
1. Leaders' behavior complements subordinates' environments and abilities — effective leaders engage in behaviors that align with and support their subordinates' environments and abilities. The higher the degree of subordinates self-perceived ability relative to task demands, the less subordinates will view path-goal clarifying behavior as acceptable (motivational).

2. Leaders' path-goal clarifying behavior adapts to different situations — effective leaders adjust their behavior based on the specific circumstances, tasks (e.g., ambiguity), and characteristics of their followers (e.g., preference for independence). This adaptability ensures that leaders can effectively guide and motivate their subordinates towards achieving goals.

:::notes

Leadership behavior classes refers to types of actions and conduct that leaders incorporate into their management styles in order to effectively lead their teams, motivate them, and achieve their goals.

Achievement-oriented leader behavior
: sets challenging goals, emphasize excellence, and demonstrate confidence in employees’ abilities.

Work facilitation/supportive leader behavior
: plans, schedules, organizes, and coordinates the work; provides mentoring, coaching, counseling, and feedback to assist employees in developing their skills. 

Interaction facilitation
: collaboratively removes obstacles that prevent interaction, including dispute resolution, facilitation of communication, and listening to all voices.

Group oriented decision process
: focus on decisions that affect group dynamics and production and on increasing acceptance of such decisions.

Representation and networking
: address the need of leaders to network and actively represent the function of the work unit (e.g., to establish the legitimacy of the work unit)

Value-based leader behavior
: helps establish extraordinary follower commitment by appealing to values and sentiments held dear by subordinates (requires and ideological goal)

Shared leadership
: shares responsibility for leadership to increase unit cohesiveness (functions bes in an interdependent environment)

## Group work {.html-hidden .unlisted background-color="black"}

:::medium
Identify and discuss specific behaviors and/or methods per leader behavior class that you can apply in your leadership roles (be it formal or informal).
:::

Take approx. 15 minutes for your group discussions.

> Engaged employees invest highly in their job because they enjoy it, nevertheless they know when to stop *@schaufeli2021engaging*
:::

## Work engagement

Work engagement refers to "a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterized by *vigor*, *dedication*, and *absorption*" [@schaufeli2002measurement, p. 74]

:::{.incremental}
- **Vigor** refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one’s work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties
- **Dedication** refers to being strongly involved in one’s work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge
- **Absorption** refers to being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one’s work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work
:::

. . .

Work engagement differs from **work addiction**. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don’t, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.

:::{.notes}
@taris2014beauty argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation. The former are attracted by work because it is fun, whereas the latter are driven to work in an attempt to avoid the negative thoughts and feelings that are associated with not working.
:::

## Effects

Research shows that work engagement is good for employees as well as for the organizations they work for [see e.g., @schaufeli2013engagement].

:::{.incremental}
- Engaged employees **suffer less from all kinds of stress complaints** (e.g., depression)
- They run a **lower risk of cardiovascular disease** and, hence, their show **lower sickness absenteeism**.
- Engaged employees also feel strongly committed to their organization and therefore show **lower turnover intentions**.
- They often show a **growth mindset** (e.g., like to learn and develop themselves, take personal initiative, and are innovative).
- Engaged employees **perform better** (e.g., make fewer mistakes).
:::

## Engaging leadership

**Engaging leadership** is defined as leadership behavior that facilitates, strengthens, connects and inspires employees in order to increase their work engagement [@schaufeli2021engaging, p. 4]

:::{.incremental}
- **Facilitating** team-members satisfies the need for *autonomy* by giving them the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.
- **Strengthening**  team-members satisfies the need for *competence*, e.g., by delegating tasks and responsibilities, giving them challenging jobs and stimulating their talents.
- **Connecting** team-members satisfies the need for *relatedness*, e.g., by encouraging collaboration and creating a good team spirit.
- **Inspiring** team-members satisfies the need for *meaning*, e.g., by enthusing them about a particular vision, mission, idea or plan and recognising their personal contribution to the overall goal of the team or organisation.
:::

## Effects

**Engaging leadership** is expected to lead to the satisfaction of **basic psychological needs** (e.g., autonomy, competence, relatedness, meaning) and improved **work engagement** and **performance**.

. . .

Satisfying basic psychological needs subsequently leads to

:::{.incremental}
- strengthened personal **job resources** (e.g., autonomy, task variety, role clarity, social support),
- an increased effect of HR policies (e.g., regarding training and education) on well-being,
- an increase in **work engagement** of employees, 
- decrease of **boredom**, and 
- increase in **individual performance** and **team performance**.
:::

## Team effectiveness

Engaging leadership positively effects performance at the individual and team level [@schaufeli2021engaging], thus increases **team effectiveness**.

. . .

According to @hill2003becoming, an effective team does not only involve **team performance**, but is characterized by three criteria:

:::{.incremental}
1. The team *performs*: the output meets the standards of those who have to use it
2. The team members are *satisfied and learn* (i.e., the team experience contributes to each member's personal well-being and development)
3. The team *adapts and learns* (i.e., the team experience enhances the capability of members to work and learn together in the future)
:::

. . .

In today's dynamic environment, **engaging leadership** should facilitate, strengthen, connect and inspire employees to improve on all three interrelated criteria.

## Managing paradox

Committed leaders need to be aware of at least four contradictory forces in team work and deal with these paradoxes [@hill2003becoming]:

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- Embrace individual differences 	&#11108;  Embrace collective identity and goals
- Foster support 	&#11108;  Foster confrontation
- Focus on performance 	&#11108;  Focus on learning and development
- Rely on managerial authority 	&#11108;  Rely on team members' discretion and autonomy
:::

. . .

Consequently, engaging leadership requires **behavioral complexity**.

## Group work {.html-hidden .unlisted background-color="black"}

Discuss following questions:

- How is **disengaging leadership** characterized?
- How might characteristics of the digital era and tools used (unnoticed) promote disengaging leadership?
- How can leaders prevent those they lead from disengaging?

Take approx. 15 minutes to discuss your thoughts.

## Disengaging leadership

According to @schaufeli2021engaging, engaging leadership can be contrasted with its opposite **disengaging leadership**.

. . .

Disengaging leadership is characterized by: 

:::{.incremental} 
- **Coercive behavior**, which refers to authoritarian behaviour that restricts and controls employees.
- **Eroding behavior** that aims to hinder staff members' professional development and diminish their sense of competence
- **Isolating behavior** that disconnects staff from the rest of the team and pits them against each other
- **Demotivating behavior** that aims to create the impression that employees' work is meaningless and that their work does not contribute to anything important. 
:::

. . .

People that exhibit these behaviors thwart the basic needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning.
