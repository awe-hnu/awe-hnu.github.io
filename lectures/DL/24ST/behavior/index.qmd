Discuss your answers to the following questions based on the insights from @schaufeli2021engaging's reading:

- What is **work engagement** and what effects have been identified?
- What is **engaging leadership** and what effects have been identified?

Take approx. 15 minutes to discuss your insights and prepare informal presentation of your findings.

# Work engagement {background-color="#cdd6d5" background-image="../assets/engagement.jpg"}

::: {.html-hidden}
> Engaged employees invest highly in their job because they enjoy it, nevertheless they know when to stop *@schaufeli2021engaging*
:::

## Definition

Work engagement refers to "a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterized by *vigor*, *dedication*, and *absorption*" [@schaufeli2002measurement, p. 74]

:::{.incremental}
- **Vigor** refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one’s work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties
- **Dedication** refers to being strongly involved in one’s work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge
- **Absorption** refers to being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one’s work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work
:::

. . .

Work engagement differs from **work addiction**. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don’t, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.

:::{.notes}
@taris2014beauty argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation. The former are attracted by work because it is fun, whereas the latter are driven to work in an attempt to avoid the negative thoughts and feelings that are associated with not working.
:::

## Effects

Research shows that work engagement is good for employees as well as for the organizations they work for [see e.g., @schaufeli2013engagement].

:::{.incremental}
- Engaged employees **suffer less from all kinds of stress complaints** (e.g., depression)
- They run a **lower risk of cardiovascular disease** and, hence, their show **lower sickness absenteeism**.
- Engaged employees also feel strongly committed to their organization and therefore show **lower turnover intentions**.
- They often show a **growth mindset** (e.g., like to learn and develop themselves, take personal initiative, and are innovative).
- Engaged employees **perform better** (e.g., make fewer mistakes).

# Engaging leadership {background-color="#cdd6d5" background-image="../assets/engagement.jpg"}

:::{.larger}
> Engaging leadership is not another leadership concept *@schaufeli2021engaging*
:::

:::{.notes}
Instead of starting with leadership behavior and then examining its impact on employee motivation and performance, @schaufeli2021engaging started with work engagement, asking: What kind of leadership behavior can promote employee work engagement?
:::

## Definition

**Engaging leadership** is defined as leadership behavior that facilitates, strengthens, connects and inspires employees in order to increase their work engagement [@schaufeli2021engaging, p. 4]

:::{.incremental}
- **Facilitating** team-members satisfies the need for *autonomy* by giving them the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.
- **Strengthening**  team-members satisfies the need for *competence*, e.g., by delegating tasks and responsibilities, giving them challenging jobs and stimulating their talents.
- **Connecting** team-members satisfies the need for *relatedness*, e.g., by encouraging collaboration and creating a good team spirit.
- **Inspiring** team-members satisfies the need for *meaning*, e.g., by enthusing them about a particular vision, mission, idea or plan and recognising their personal contribution to the overall goal of the team or organisation.
:::

## Efects

**Engaging leadership** is expected to lead to the satisfaction of **basic psychological needs** (e.g., autonomy, competence, relatedness, meaning) and improved **work engagement** and **performance**.

. . .

Satisfying basic psychological needs subsequently leads to

:::{.incremental}
- strengthened personal **job resources** (e.g., autonomy, task variety, role clarity, social support),
- an increased effect of HR policies (e.g., regarding training and education) on well-being,
- an increase in **work engagement** of employees, 
- decrease of **boredom**, and 
- increase in **individual performance** and **team performance**.
:::

## Team effectiveness

Engaging leadership positively effects performance at the individual and team level [@schaufeli2021engaging], thus increases **team effectiveness**.

. . .

According to @hill2003becoming, an effective team does not only involve **team performance**, but is characterized by three criteria:

:::{.incremental}
1. The team *performs*: the output meets the standards of those who have to use it
2. The team members are *satisfied and learn* (i.e., the team experience contributes to each member's personal well-being and development)
3. The team *adapts and learns* (i.e., the team experience enhances the capability of members to work and learn together in the future)
:::

. . .

In today's dynamic environment, **engaging leadership** should facilitate, strengthen, connect and inspire employees to improve on all three interrelated criteria.

## Managing paradox

Committed leaders need to be aware of at least four contradictory forces in team work and deal with these paradoxes [@hill2003becoming]:

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- Embrace individual differences 	&#11108;  Embrace collective identity and goals
- Foster support 	&#11108;  Foster confrontation
- Focus on performance 	&#11108;  Focus on learning and development
- Rely on managerial authority 	&#11108;  Rely on team members' discretion and autonomy
:::

. . .

Consequently, engaging leadership requires **behavioral complexity**.

## Group work {.html-hidden .unlisted background-color="black"}

Discuss your answers to following questions:

- How is **disengaging leadership** characterized?
- How might characteristics of the digital era and tools used (unnoticed) promote disengaging leadership?
- How can leaders prevent those they lead from disengaging?

Take approx. 15 minutes to discuss your insights and prepare informal presentation of your findings.

## Disengaging leadership

According to @schaufeli2021engaging, engaging leadership can be contrasted with its opposite **disengaging leadership**.

. . .

Disengaging leadership is characterized by: 

:::{.incremental} 
- **Coercive behaviour**, which refers to authoritarian behaviour that restricts and controls employees.
- **Eroding behaviour** that aims to hinder staff members' professional development and diminish their sense of competence
- **Isolating behaviour** that disconnects staff from the rest of the team and pits them against each other
- **Demotivating behaviour** that aims to create the impression that employees' work is meaningless and that their work does not contribute to anything important. 
:::

. . .

People that exhibit these behaviors thwart the basic needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning.
