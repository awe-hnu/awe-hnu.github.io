# Motivation

:::notes
Society often associates leaders with individuals that have grandiose titles, a large corner office, and make world-changing decisions. Thus, many people shy away from identifying themselves as a leader. However, real leadership can be seen most clearly in the small moments throughout the day. 

> Leadership is about behaving in a way that makes the life of another person better than before you arrived. *Drew Dudley*
