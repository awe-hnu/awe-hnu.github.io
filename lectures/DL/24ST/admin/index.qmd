# Motivation

:::notes
Society often associates leaders with individuals that have grandiose titles, a large corner office, and make world-changing decisions. Thus, many people shy away from identifying themselves as a leader. However, real leadership can be seen most clearly in the small moments throughout the day. 

> Leadership is about behaving in a way that makes the life of another person better than before you arrived. *Drew Dudley*

# General remarks

This module helps you to deepen your understanding of the requirements of leadership in the digital age — from leading oneself, to leading employees and leading systems. 

. . .

To achieve that, you will read a bunch of **scientific papers**, apply some of the findings in **(group) exercises** and, best case, reflect your own behavior.
