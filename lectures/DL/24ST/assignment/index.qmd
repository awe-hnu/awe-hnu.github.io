# Literature search

There are several ways of searching for relevant scientific literature. I recommend using the [Web of Science](http://webofknowledge.com.ezproxy.hnu.de/) or [Google Scholar](http://ezproxy.hnu.de/login?url=https://scholar.google.de) search engines.

. . .

Additional recommendations 
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Use the citation count as primary quality indicator (rule of thumb: the more cited, the more significant is the paper).
- For understanding the theory try to follow the conversation (start with early, introductory papers and then read more recent papers).
- Look for literature reviews that summarize the current state of knowledge.
- For finding recent empirical evidence look for papers that apply the theory.
