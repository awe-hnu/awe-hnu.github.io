# Assignment 

:::html-hidden
:::medium
[You **portray a leader** ]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[and **introduce a theory** ]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[to **critically reflect** on the behavior and outcomes of the leader ]{.fragment .fade-in}
[by means of a **20 minutes presentation** ]{.fragment .fade-in}
[and **5 minutes discussion**.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::
:::

::: notes
Your task is to **portray a leader** of the digital age and **critically discuss her or his leadership**. 

The portrait of the leader needs to be based on publicly available data and/or originally collected data and must be comprehensible without prior knowledge of the person. The discussion must be based on a theory related of leadership or organizational behavior. The theory needs to be introduced and then used to develop explanations of the leader's behavior and the observable outcomes. Your presentation ends with theoretically grounded conclusions and recommendations for yourself and your fellow students.

The **presentation** should take at min 17 minutes and at max 20 minutes and is followed by a critical discussion (5 to 10 minutes).

:::large

. . .

The bonus points are assigned based continuity and quality of your contributions to the exercises and the discussions of the presentations of your fellow students.

. . .

The bonus points can improve your performance by up to two grade increments (up to .7).

[^Bonus]: The bonus points are only taken into account when determining the module grade if it results in a better module grade and the original module grade is at least "4.0". Participation in the bonus course is voluntary. For details, please see the general examination regulations of the HNU (*APO*).

# Literature search

There are several ways of searching literature for your theoretical foundations. I recommend using the [Web of Science](http://webofknowledge.com.ezproxy.hnu.de/) or [Google Scholar](http://ezproxy.hnu.de/login?url=https://scholar.google.de) search engines.

Additional recommendations 
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Use the citation count as primary quality indicator (rule of thumb: the more cited, the more significant is the paper).
- For understanding the theory try to follow the conversation (start with early, introductory papers and then read more recent papers).
- Look for literature reviews that summarize the current state of knowledge.
- For finding recent empirical evidence look for papers that apply the theory.
