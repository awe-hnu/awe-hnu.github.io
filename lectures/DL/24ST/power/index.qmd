## Power in organizations

Organizations can be seen as both, **cooperative systems** of employees working together to achieve goals and **political arenas** of individuals and groups with differing interests [@brass2017intraorganizational].

. . .

**Power** can be defined as the ability to get other people to do what you want them to do, **politics** as *power in action*, using a range of techniques and tactics [@buchanan2020power].

. . .


Power and politics is at the heart of how organizations function [@hill2003becoming]. 

. . .

Though, often associated with negative connotations, @buchanan2020power shows that the view of the damaging, negative consequences of politics is too narrow. Politics can be both ‘functional’ and ‘dysfunctional’.

## Power and leadership

Other things being equal, political conflict increases with growing interdependence, diversity, and resource scarcity [@pfeffer1992managing].

. . .

> Managers who ignore or fail to understand how power and influence work in organizations will find that they and their teams experience difficulty in being effective and ethical in their work. *@hill2003becoming [p. 273]*

. . .

Development of competing coalitions and periods of organizational crisis exacerbate political conflict, while leadership and shared value help to reduce the amount of conflict [@hill2003becoming].

. . .

Leaders need to define a vision that aligns and motivates people, creates shared values, and a shared culture—these are critical mechanisms for managing the increased diversity and interpedendence in organizations today.

If it is not a formal authority, what are the main sources of power?
:::

## Personal and positional characteristics

#### Sources of personal power [@hill2003becoming, p. 276]

:::{.incremental}
- **Expertise**: relevant knowledge and skills
- **Track record**: relevant experience
- **Attractiveness**: attributes that others find appealing and identify with
- **Effort**: expenditure of time and energy
:::

#### Sources of positional power [@hill2003becoming, p. 276]

:::{.incremental}
- **Formal authority**: position in hierarchy and prescribed responsibilities
- **Relevance**: relationship between task and organizational objectives
- **Centrality**: position in key networks
- **Autonomy**: amount of discretion in a position
- **Visibility**: degree to which performance can be seen by others

## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color="black"}

:::large
Why is a strong, well-developed network a meaningful source of power?
:::

Relate your answers to the social capital theory.

## Building key relationships

Companies are increasingly required to engage in cross-organizational work (across levels, functions, geographies) in an effort to improve their capacities to execute and innovate.

. . . 

Leaders need to build and maintain key relationships to identify changes in the priorities and needs of these groups and prepare their field for new opportunities and threats—**a strong, well-developed network** can provide the kind of big picture information needed in today's world [@brass2012power].

. . .

It is, thus, required to **identify dependencies**^[Dependencies can be analyzed by asking questions such as *On whom am I dependent, and who depends on me?*], to **take into account the political dynamics** that make for potential sources of conflict^[Political dynamics can be understood by asking, e.g., *What differences exist between me and the people on whom I am dependent? What sources of power do I have to influence this relationship?*], and to invest time and energy in **building and maintaining relationships** with those on whom the team is dependent^[Questions like *What can be done to cultivate or repair the relationship?* help to cultivate relationships] [@hill2003becoming].

it is who you know.

:::incremental
- Gaining membership to exclusive clubs requires inside contacts
- Attractive jobs are usually won by those with friends in high places
- Friends and family constitute the final safety net if one falls hard

## History {visibility=hidden}

The concept of social capital has been relative independently introduced by scholars from various disciplines at different times.

:::notes
Seminal works particularly originate from 

- James Coleman (1988) on the topic of education/utilisation of human capital (e.g., @coleman1988social)
- Robert Putman (1993) on social participation (e.g., @putnam2000bowling)
- Pierre Bourdieu (1983) on the relationship between economic, cultural and social capital (e.g., @bourdieu2018forms)
- Ronald Burt (1982) on social networks (e.g., @burt2018structural)
:::

Since the 1990s the concept of social capital found its way into organizational and management sciences to explain e.g.

:::incremental
- value creation in intrafirm networks [@tsai1998social],
- creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social],
- productivity of R&D teams [@reagans2001networks], 
- project performance [@di2012social], and
- business-IT alignment [@wagner2014social].
:::

## Definitions

> Social capital is defined by its function. It is not a single entity, but a variety of different entities having two characteristics in common: They all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals who are within the structure. Like other forms of capital, social capital is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that would not be attainable in its absence *@coleman1988social [p. 98]*

. . .

> ... features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefits *@putnam1993prosperous [p. 67]*

------

> ... the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance or recognition *@bourdieu1986forms [p. 21]*

. . .

> ... the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or an social unit. Social capital thus comprises both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network. *@nahapiet1998social [p. 243]*

## Similarities and distinctions

The definitions of social capital share some similarities and distinctions:

:::incremental
- There is an emphasis on the **structure of social relations** (networks)
- Social capital is seen as **a resource for action** (individual goal achievement)
- The **level of analysis** stems from macro-level to meso/micro-level
- The **causal structure** of social capital is conceived differently\
  - Networks as source of social capital; social capital is a result of network embeddedness [e.g., @bourdieu1986forms; @coleman1988social].
  - The network of relations is equivalent to social capital [e.g., @putnam1993prosperous; @nahapiet1998social].
:::

## Strong vs. week ties

:::fragment
@coleman1988social argues that cohesion, that is to say the **strength of the relationship between actors**, is the source of social capital (*strong ties*)
:::

:::incremental
- Cohesion facilitates the creation of social norms, trust and sanctions within networks, which safeguard against opportunistic behavior 
- Cohesion enables coordination and increases willingness of actors to engage in knowledge exchange (*bonding*)
:::

:::fragment
@burt2018structural posits that social capital rather emerges from **opportunities to bridge disconnections** or non-equivalencies separating non-redundant sources of information (*structural holes*) 
:::

:::incremental
- Structural holes (i.e. ‘weak ties’) provide the opportunity to get access to diverse sets of perspectives, skills, or resources.
- Social capital emerges from structurally favorable positions between different group of actors (*bridging*)
:::

## Structure, cognition, and relation

![Social capital in the creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social, p. 251]](images/nahapiet.svg){#fig-nahapiet}

:::notes

Structural dimension
: The structural dimension reflects *“the overall pattern of connections between actors”* [@nahapiet1998social, p. 244] — the possibilities of actors to interact with others (‘physical’ ties)

Relational dimension
: The relational dimension *“relates to the nature and quality of the relationships among team members”* [@robert2008social, p. 319] — the relational strength of ties (trust, respect, norms, identification) 

Cognitive dimension
: The cognitive dimension refers to *“those resources providing shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning among parties”* [@nahapiet1998social, p. 244] — the ability to communicate and effectively access resources

:::

## Value

The ultimate value of a given form of social capital is context-dependent [@adler2002social].

[Strong ties]{.medium .link-color .fragment}\
[Effective search for novel information\
(competitive rivalry, certain tasks, individual contribution)]{.fragment}

[Weak ties]{.medium .link-color .fragment}\
[Effective transfer of information and tacit knowledge\
(collective goals, uncertain tasks, group contribution)]{.fragment}

:::fragment
The value is further dependent on the availability of complementary resources (e.g., combination capability)
:::

## Opportunity, motivation, and ability

![The conceptual model of social capital according to @adler2002social [p. 23]](images/adler.svg){#fig-nahapiet}

:::notes

Opportunities
: The social network creates opportunities for social capital transactions to leverage external resources (*bridging*) and to act together (*bonding*) [@adler2002social].

Motivation
: Contact’s motivation determines the share of potential resources. Motivation reflects the willingness to define and act on collective goals caused by shared interests, common identity, and commitment to the common good [@adler2002social].

Ability
: If social relations are mobilized is contingent on resources that enables actors to mobilize their social relations (e.g. shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning) [@adler2002social].
