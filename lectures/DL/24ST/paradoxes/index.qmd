# Paradoxes in leadership {background-color="#cdd6d5"}

::: medium
> Leadership requires the capacity to **recognize** and **react** to paradox, contradiction, and complexity. *@denison1995paradox*
:::

::: notes
Traditional management theories have often presented organizational phenomena in terms of **discrete, opposing categories** (e.g., Theory X and Theory Y, transactional and transformational leadership). In contrast, more recent theorizing has placed greater emphasis on paradox[^1], contradiction, and complexity, suggesting that many phenomexna may in fact fit **multiple opposing categories simultaneously**.

While not denying the underlying discrete categories, this more complex perspective implies that effective leaders are those who have the cognitive and behavioral **capacity to recognize and react to paradox, contradiction, and complexity in their environments** [@denison1995paradox]. Particularly when considering that **paradox is fundamental to contemporary work contexts** characterized by globalization, technological change, and increased competition [@lavine2014paradoxical].

![The competing values in a framework based on @quinn1988beyond](images/complexities.svg){#fig-complexities}

The creator of the competing values framework (CVF), @quinn1988beyond argues that top managers and leaders are better able to recognize and deal with contradictions and paradoxes that often manifest themselves in the form of conflict, unconstructive conversations and misalignment of leadership and management capacity with an organisation's strategic challenges. He identified multiple competing demands and views between members within the organization and across various levels of the organization. He showed that these reflect different values of individuals and often different cultures which had become embedded in parts of and across organizations. @quinn1988beyond set out his attempt to develop an integrating framework that could capture these in a meaningful way, with different mixes of paradoxes and contradictions at each point in time, and to show how individuals and organisations could better appreciate the circumstances and move forward.

@quinn1988beyond distilled the competing values in a framework with two dimensions and resulting four quadrants. The dimensions express the tensions or competing values that characterize all organisations. One axis represents the continuum between flexibility or adaptability and stability or control. The other axis describes the continuum between efficient internal processes, such as human resource practices or internal control systems, and external positioning vis-Ã -vis stakeholders such as competitors, customers and clients. Each continuum highlights performance criteria that are opposite to the other end of the continuum, such as internal versus external alignment (horizontal axis) or flexibility versus stability (vertical axis).

The main characteristics of the **clan culture**, so called because it resembles a family-like orientation, include empowerment, team building and employee participation; the main characteristics of the **adhocracy culture** include adaptability, creativity and risk-taking; this type of culture is often found in innovative industries. The main characteristics of **hierarchy culture** include standardization, predictability and multiple levels of management; the authors suggest that this type of culture is usually found in government agencies. Finally, @cameron2011diagnosing suggest that **market culture**, with its characteristic outward orientation and competitive attitude, is often found in organisations operating in unstable and crowded operating environments.

The four orientations are intuitively appealing, perhaps confirming their origin in psychological archetypes; most people can probably find the culture of their current organisation somewhere in this taxonomy. However, as the academic labels for thein each quadrant are often misunderstood, it has proven useful to substitute more accessible and commonly used verbs to describe the dominant activities that relate to each culture---*collaborate*, *create*, *compete*, and *control* [@lavine2014paradoxical].

: CVF --- management skills and leadership behaviors [@lavine2014paradoxical] {#tbl-cvf}

## Implications

Leadership qualities seem to be best demonstrated by **more movement throughout the framework**, suggesting complex adaptation to changing circumstances [@denison1995paradox]. 

. . .

> Complex situations require complex responses. Sometimes organizations benefit from stability, and sometimes they benefit from change. Often organizations need both stability and change at the same time. In contrast to earlier approaches, the development of the competing values framework did not assume that stability and change were mutually exclusive, an either/or decision. *@quinn2020becoming [p. 12]*

:::notes
The CVF provides a description of roles and behaviors to encourage self-reflection and to provide a preliminary sense of behaviors and accompanying roles that can be *learned*. Working to **overcome areas of relative weakness** so that they can be **transformed into average or adequate performance** can help leaders see more opportunities for action when core areas of strength are not delivering the desired results.

Collective genius
:::

. . .

> Leading innovation takes a distinctive kind of leadership, one that unleashes and harnesses the "collective genius" of the people in the organization. *Linda A. Hill*


## Innovation

:::medium
An innovation can be defined as an idea, practice, or material artifact perceived to be **new** by the relevant unit of adoption and offers **worthwhile benefits** [@dewar1986adoption].
:::

:::notes

Innovations can be differentiated according to **the degree of deviation** from existing technologies and practices: incremental innovation and radical innovation [@mcdermott2002managing].

-   **Radical innovations** are fundamental changes that represent revolutionary changes in technology [@dewar1986adoption]. They represent clear departures from existing practices and require new skills, levels of market understanding, leaps in new processing abilities, and systems throughout the organization [@mcdermott2002managing].
-   **Incremental innovations** are minor improvements or simple adjustments in current technology (Munson and Pelz 1979

The main difference that characterizes the two dipoles is the **degree of new knowledge** contained in the innovation [@dewar1986adoption], which implies **technological uncertainty**, **technical inexperience**, **business inexperience**, and **technology cost**.

:::

## Nature of innovation {.html-hidden}

::: medium
Innovation is not about some genius having an **aha moment**.
:::

. . .

**Innovation is a team sport** --- combining individual's member's separate slices of genius into a single work of collective genius. Innovation requires a place where people are willing and able to do the hard work that innovative problem solving requires.


## Significance

Competitiveness depends to a large extent on the ability to innovate. So the ongoing challenge is to build an organisation that is able to innovate all the time.

. . .

> The rhetoric of innovation is often about fun and creativity, but the reality is that innovation can be very taxing and uncomfortable, both emotionally and intellectually. @hill2014collective [*p. 5*]

. . .

This requires leadership---a different kind of leadership?

## Leadership

:::medium
> The role of a leader of innovation is not to set a vision and motivate others to follow it. It's to create a community that is willing and able to generate new ideas. *@hill2014collective [p. 4]*
:::

## Genius collective

::: notes
@hill2014collective has done in-depth research on many exceptional innovation leaders in different organisations and at different levels (e.g. Pixar, VW, Pentagram, Google, Pfizer, IBM). They asked what role the leader plays in creating a more innovative organisation. They concluded that *directive leadership* can work well when the solution to a problem is known and clear. But when the problem requires a truly original answer, no one can decide in advance what that answer should be. Therefore, *leading innovation* cannot be about creating a vision, persuading people and then somehow inspiring them to implement it.
:::

::: medium
So the question is not *How do I make innovation happen?* [but rather, *How do I set the stage for it to happen?*]{.fragment .fade-in}

## Paradoxes of innovation

The paradox at the heart of innovation is the need to **unleash** the talents of individuals and to **harness** those talents in the form of collective innovation [@hill2014collectiveB].

::: {.r-stack .html-hidden}
![Paradoxes of innovation according to @hill2014collective](images/p-1.svg){.fragment height="360" fig-align="left"}

![&nbsp;](images/paradoxes.svg){.fragment height="360" fig-align="left"}
:::

::: notes
@hill2014collective identified six innovation paradoxes. The challenge for leaders is to help the organization continually re-calibrate between:

-   affirming the individual *... and* the group
-   supporting *... and* confronting (i.e., collaborative disagreement)
-   fostering experimentation and learning *... and* performance
-   promoting improvisation *... and* and structure
-   showing patience *... and* and urgency
-   encouraging bottom-up initiative *... and* and intervening top-down

Leaders who stay on the right side of this paradox will never be able to unleash the full genius of their staff; they will have few or no ideas to use. Those who stay on the left side will have many ideas and possibilities to work with, but they will not be able to turn them into new and useful solutions; instead, conflict and chaos will reign. The correct position at any given time will depend on the circumstances. However, the goal will always be to take the position that enables the collaboration, experimentation and integration that are necessary for innovation.

To build **willingness**, leaders must must nurture a sense of community, which rests on three elements---a sense of *purpose*, *values*, and *rules of engagement* [@hill2014collective].

Purpose
:   Purpose is not what a group does but who is in it or why it exists. It is about a collective identity.

Shared values
:   To form a community, members have to agree on what is important. By shaping the group's priorities and choices, values influence individual and collective thought and action (e.g., bold ambition, collaboration, responsibility, learning)

Rules of engagement
:   Those keep members focused on what is imperative, discourage unproductive behaviors, and encourage activities that foster innovation (e.g., respect, trust, influence, see the whole, question everything, be data driven.

The **ability** to innovate, is dependent on the leader creating *creative abrasion*, *creative resulution*, and *creative agility* [@hill2014collective].

Creative abrasion
:   The ability to develop a marketplace where rich diverse ideas compete through discourse and debate.

Creative agility
:   The ability to develop and test different options, learn from outcomes and try again and again till the optimal option is evolved.

Creative resolution
:   The ability to to make decisions that combine disparate and sometimes even opposing ideas.

**Paradoxes**

**Ingredients**

-   Diversity (i.e., people who think differently)
-   Cognitive conflict over ideas and appraches (i.e., aimed at learning and improving not winning/losing/dominating) --- doing experiments

**Leader's role**

-   Espouse, encourage, expect and practice communal norms that value and even amplified diversity.
-   Push people together and create situation in which diverse thinkers where put in close proximity
-   Create organizational bridges

> We used to launch products in an "all or nothing" mode to all of our users. Now we had the capability to test multiple different live versions of new products on 1 percent samples of our users. This yielded huge data sets and brought with it a change in mind-set for approaching innovation. We began to avoid projects that only allowed for "zero or one" decisions, instead choosing projects that could be rolled out and **evaluated in small slices**. *Philipp Justus, eBay Germany*

::: notes
Creative agility is about **discovery based learning**. It involves quickly pursuing multiple experiments, learning from the outcomes, and then adjusting plans. @hill2014collective[*p. 9*]

**Paradoxes**

-   Learning and development vs. performance
-   Improvisation vs. structure

**Leader's role**

-   Pursue new ideas vigorously, proactively again and again
-   Reflect to harvest knowledge (consciously, collaboratively and openly)

Or, in another scenario, they had to recognize it was not quite right, then decide to work on something else, in the best-case scenario **integrating their knowledge to another solution**. *Bill Coughranm, Google*

#### Self-check

Are you an innovation leader? Start by asking yourself these questions about your organization [@hill2014collective, p. 10]:

-   Do members of my organization feel part of a community?
-   Does my organization have a shared purpose---one that binds us together and compels us all to do the hard work of innovation?
-   Does it live by rules of engagement supportive of a set of core values: bold ambition, responsibility to the community, collaboration, and learning?
-   Do we have the ability to generate ideas through candid discourse and debate?
-   Do we have the ability to test ideas through quick pursuit, reflection, and adaptation?
-   Do we have the ability to make integrative decisions, rather than compromising or letting some groups dominate?

Ask yourself some questions about your own leadership mind-set and practices: - Do I think my primary job as a leader is to create a context in which my team can innovate? - Am I comfortable serving as the "stage setter" as opposed to the visionary leading from the front? - Do I have the courage and patience required to amplify differences, even when discussion becomes heated and when ambiguity and complexity loom?

If your answer to any of these questions is "no" or even "I don't know," it's probably time to look again at your own leadership role and at the leadership potential that may be hiding in your organization.
