:::notes
Society often associates leaders with individuals that have grandiose titles, a large corner office, and make world-changing decisions. Thus, many people shy away from identifying themselves as a leader. However, real leadership can be seen most clearly in the small moments throughout the day.

> Leadership is about behaving in a way that makes the life of another person better than before you arrived. *@dudley2010everyday*

:::notes
This module develops evidence-based leadership capabilities and systematic stakeholder management competencies essential for influencing organizational outcomes in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.

To this end, you will read a series of scientific papers, consolidate and deepen your knowledge in exercises adn reflections, build a personal **latticework of mental models for leadership**, and research on a (digital) leader to make sense of her/his behavior using two theoretical lenses.

As a graded exam assignment, you will present your findings to your fellow students and deliver a substantive, theory-informed critique of one of their presentations.

It is very important that you prepare yourself for the classes (see @tbl-schedule for details).

:::notes
We follow an expanding circle of influence to build understanding of leadership at multiple levels — from self-awareness through interpersonal influence to organizational and ecosystem-level leadership:

- **Foundations & mental models** (latticework thinking, decision-making under complexity, the digital leadership context)
- **The leader** (traits, emotional intelligence, self-awareness, evolution of leadership thought)
- **Adaptive leadership** (paradoxes, competing values, behavioral complexity, situational approaches)
- **Motivating & engaging followers** (path-goal theory, self-determination theory, engaging leadership)
- **Building high-performing teams** (team development, psychological safety, diversity & inclusion, virtual teams)
- **Conflict, power & politics** (conflict dynamics, sources of power, lateral leadership, organizational politics)
- **Stakeholder management & coalitions** (social capital theory, stakeholder mapping, engagement strategies, coalition building)
- **Leadership in context** (cross-cultural leadership, ethical and sustainable leadership, adaptive leadership for digital transformation)
- **Storytelling** (narrative as a leadership tool, persuasion, stakeholder communication)
