# Introduction {.headline-only}

## Today's session

:::medium
- Silent dialogue warm-up [15 min]{.smaller}
- Cross-cultural leadership [30 min]{.smaller}
- Leading across boundaries [20 min]{.smaller}
- [Break]{.highlight}
- Ethical & sustainable leadership [25 min]{.smaller}
- DT synthesis & latticework integration [25 min]{.smaller}
- Reflection & closing [10 min]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
135 minutes total (including break).

The session builds on the homework from Unit 7: students reflected on their cultural background, experiences with cultural differences, and ethical principles. This personal reflection grounds the theory in lived experience.

- The activation uses a **silent written dialogue** — pairs exchange written responses on cards, creating a reflective start that models cross-cultural communication challenges.
- The cross-cultural exercise uses a **culture simulation game** — groups receive different "cultural norm" cards and must negotiate a decision, experiencing cultural friction firsthand.
- The ethical dilemma exercise uses a **structured academic controversy (SAC)** — pairs first argue one side, then switch and argue the other, before synthesizing.
- The DT synthesis uses an **expert panel simulation** — groups become "consulting firms" and present integrated diagnoses.

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. **Explain** how cultural dimensions (Hofstede, GLOBE) shape leadership effectiveness across contexts
2. **Compare** authentic, servant, and sustainable leadership as ethical frameworks
3. **Integrate** all course concepts to diagnose a digital transformation challenge
4. **Reflect** on your personal latticework and identify areas for continued development
:::

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Cultural reflection check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Share one insight from your cultural reflection homework.

:::notes
**Silent written dialogue — Phase 1: Writing (3 min).**

Each student receives two index cards. Card 1: "One cultural value that strongly shapes how you think about leadership." Card 2: "One experience where cultural differences affected teamwork or leadership." Students write in silence — no talking. The silence models the discomfort of cross-cultural communication where verbal cues are absent, setting the theme for the session.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Exchange cards with your neighbor.\
Read silently, then write a response on the back.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

What surprises you about your partner's cultural assumptions?

:::notes
**Silent written dialogue — Phase 2: Exchange (4 min).**

Partners swap cards and read silently (1 min). Then each writes a response on the back of their partner's card: a question, a connection to their own experience, or a surprise (2 min). Then they read each other's responses silently (1 min). The entire exchange happens in writing — no talking.

This format slows down the conversation, forces careful reading, and models the experience of written-first communication common in cross-cultural virtual teams. Walk around and observe — some pairs will want to talk. Gently redirect them to write.
:::

## Plenary debrief {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What cultural assumptions about leadership did you discover? Were any surprising?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Silent written dialogue — Phase 3: Voice (5 min).**

NOW students may speak. Ask: "What was it like to communicate only in writing? What did you notice that you might have missed in a verbal exchange?" (2 min). Then: "What cultural assumptions about leadership did you discover through the cards?" (3 min).

Debrief the format itself: "The silent dialogue forced you to slow down, read carefully, and respond thoughtfully — exactly the skills cross-cultural leadership demands. Verbal fluency can mask cultural misunderstandings; writing makes them visible."

Preview: "Today we explore how culture shapes leadership — what works in one context may fail in another."

Connect: "Our latticework of mental models is itself culturally shaped. The models we've studied were largely developed in Western contexts. Today we examine that assumption."
:::

# Cross-cultural leadership {.headline-only}

## Revisiting the territory

In Unit 1, we introduced Korzybski's principle: **the map is not the territory**.

:::fragment
:::medium
Culture is perhaps the ultimate example — our cultural mental models shape everything we see, yet we are often unaware of them.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (2 min).**

Frame: what works in one cultural context may fail — or even offend — in another. Effective leadership requires recognizing which assumptions are culturally contingent. This is the "map vs. territory" principle applied to culture.
:::

## Hofstede's cultural dimensions

The cultural dimensions framework [@hofstede1980cultures] identifies six dimensions along which national cultures vary:

:::incremental
- **Power distance** — acceptance of unequal power distribution. High: Malaysia, Philippines. Low: Austria, Denmark.
- **Individualism vs. collectivism** — integration into groups. Individualist: USA, UK. Collectivist: China, Japan.
- **Uncertainty avoidance** — discomfort with ambiguity. High: Greece, Japan. Low: Singapore, Denmark.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through these three dimensions with leadership implications:
- **Power distance**: In high power-distance cultures, directive leadership is expected and respected. In low power-distance cultures, participative leadership is preferred. A leader who is "too directive" in Denmark may be seen as authoritarian; a leader who is "too participative" in Malaysia may be seen as weak.
- **Individualism**: Individualist cultures reward individual achievement; collectivist cultures prioritize group harmony. Feedback, recognition, and motivation strategies must adapt accordingly.
- **Uncertainty avoidance**: High UA cultures prefer clear rules and procedures; low UA cultures are more comfortable with ambiguity and improvisation.

Caveat: each dimension is a continuum, not a binary. Individual variation within any culture is enormous.
:::

## Hofstede continued

:::incremental
- **Masculinity vs. femininity** — degree to which gender roles are distinct. Masculine: Japan, Hungary. Feminine: Sweden, Norway.
- **Long-term vs. short-term orientation** — focus on future vs. past and present. Long-term: China, Japan. Short-term: USA, UK.
- **Indulgence vs. restraint** — degree to which society allows free gratification of desires. Indulgent: Mexico, Nigeria. Restrained: Russia, China.
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Each dimension is a continuum — and individual variation within any culture is enormous. These are tendencies, not determinisms.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

For leaders, the practical value is not memorizing country scores but developing *awareness* that cultural differences exist and *curiosity* to discover how they manifest. As @hofstede1980cultures warned: "Culture is not a characteristic of individuals; it encompasses a number of people who were conditioned by the same education and life experience."
:::

## The GLOBE study

The GLOBE study [@house2004culture] extended Hofstede by studying leadership across 62 cultures.

:::fragment
Key finding — **six culturally endorsed leadership dimensions**:
:::

:::incremental
- **Charismatic/value-based** — visionary, inspirational [universally valued]{.link-color}
- **Team-oriented** — collaborative, diplomatic [universally valued]{.link-color}
- **Participative** — involving others in decisions [culturally contingent]{.link-color}
- **Humane-oriented** — modest, compassionate [culturally contingent]{.link-color}
- **Autonomous** — independent, self-reliant [culturally contingent]{.link-color}
- **Self-protective** — status-conscious, face-saving [culturally contingent]{.link-color}
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

GLOBE's key contribution: *some* leadership aspects are universal, *others* are culturally contingent.

**Universal:** Charismatic and team-oriented leadership are valued across virtually all cultures. Vision, integrity, and team-building are foundational regardless of context.

**Culturally contingent:** Participative leadership is highly valued in Western, individualist cultures but less so in high power-distance cultures. Autonomous leadership is valued in some cultures (Germanic Europe) but seen negatively in others (Latin America).

Practical implication: leaders working across cultures need to distinguish their *universal* behaviors (which they can rely on) from their *culturally contingent* behaviors (which they need to adapt). This is behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)) applied to culture.
:::

## Cultural intelligence

:::medium
**Cultural intelligence (CQ)** is the capability to function effectively across cultural contexts.
:::

:::fragment
CQ comprises four components:
:::

:::incremental
- **CQ Drive** — motivation to learn about and engage with other cultures
- **CQ Knowledge** — understanding of cultural norms, practices, and conventions
- **CQ Strategy** — ability to plan for and make sense of culturally diverse encounters
- **CQ Action** — ability to adapt behavior appropriately in cross-cultural situations
:::

:::fragment
Like emotional intelligence ([Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)), cultural intelligence is **developable** — it improves with deliberate exposure, reflection, and practice.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

CQ is particularly relevant for digital leaders because digital transformation often spans cultural boundaries: global teams, international stakeholders, cross-cultural customer bases.

CQ builds on course concepts: self-awareness ([Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) is the foundation for recognizing cultural biases. Behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)) is required to flex leadership style. Stakeholder empathy ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)) must include cultural empathy.
:::

## Cross-cultural leadership exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
How would leadership approach differ across cultures?
:::

**Scenario:** You are leading a global product team with members from Germany, Japan, Brazil, and the USA. You need to make a critical decision about the product roadmap. Each cultural context has different expectations about decision-making, communication, and hierarchy.

1. **Identify** the cultural dimensions most relevant to this scenario
2. **Predict** how each cultural group might expect the decision to be made
3. **Design** a decision-making process that respects cultural differences while enabling effective collaboration

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Culture simulation game (14 min total: 10 min simulation, 4 min debrief).**

Preparation (before class): Create 4 sets of "cultural norm" cards:
- **German cards**: "You expect a structured agenda. Decisions need data. Speak directly and concisely."
- **Japanese cards**: "Build consensus before the meeting. Avoid public disagreement. Silence means thinking, not agreement."
- **Brazilian cards**: "Relationships come first. Small talk matters. Hierarchy is respected but warmth is expected."
- **American cards**: "Speak up immediately. The best idea wins. Decisions should be fast and individual."

Assign each group member a cultural role (mix cultures within groups). Groups simulate a 7-minute product roadmap meeting where each person stays in character. After 7 minutes, freeze: "How did it feel? Where did friction arise?"

Debrief (4 min): "Which cultural dimensions caused the most friction?" Expected: power distance × decision-making speed, collectivism × individual accountability.

Connect to behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): the leader must hold multiple cultural frames simultaneously.
:::

# Leading across boundaries {.headline-only}

## Matrix organizations and cross-functional leadership

:::medium
In the digital age, **cross-functional collaboration** is the norm. Most leaders must influence across hierarchies, functions, and geographies simultaneously.
:::

:::fragment
Key challenges:
:::

:::incremental
- **Competing loyalties** — team members report to multiple managers
- **Information asymmetry** — different functions have different data and jargon
- **Coordination costs** — every boundary crossed adds communication overhead
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Cross-boundary leadership is where several units' concepts converge:
- **Lateral leadership** ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) — influencing without formal authority
- **Stakeholder management** ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)) — every function is a stakeholder group
- **Cultural intelligence** (this unit) — functional cultures can be as different as national cultures
- **Engaging leadership** ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)) — maintaining motivation across boundaries

The leader who navigates these boundaries effectively creates the most value in complex organizations.
:::

## Leading geographically distributed teams

Building on [Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)'s treatment of virtual teams, the cultural dimension adds complexity:

:::incremental
- **Communication style differences** — direct (Germanic, Anglo) vs. indirect (Asian, Latin American)
- **Time orientation** — monochronic vs. polychronic cultures clash in scheduling
- **Decision-making norms** — consensus-driven vs. top-down vs. debate-driven approaches
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
The adaptive leader's task: create shared norms that respect cultural differences while enabling effective collaboration.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This extends the virtual team practices from [Unit 5](../team/index.qmd): structured communication rhythms, explicit norms, and intentional relationship building are even more critical when cultural differences add another layer of complexity.

Ask: "What explicit norms would you establish for a culturally diverse virtual team?" Collect 2–3 responses briefly.
:::

# Ethical & sustainable leadership {.headline-only}

## Why ethics matters

:::medium
Trust is the **foundation** of all leadership — and trust is built on perceived ethical behavior.
:::

:::fragment
When leaders act unethically, the damage extends far beyond the immediate situation:
:::

:::incremental
- Follower commitment erodes (engaging leadership, [Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd), depends on trust)
- Psychological safety collapses ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd) — if the leader can't be trusted, no one feels safe)
- Social capital is destroyed ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd) — the relational dimension depends on trust)
- Organizational legitimacy is undermined (stakeholder salience shifts)
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Ethics is not a separate "topic" — it is woven through every course concept. Trust is the currency that makes engaging leadership, psychological safety, social capital, and stakeholder engagement possible. Unethical behavior destroys that currency.
:::

## Authentic leadership

Authentic leadership emphasizes the leader's **genuine self** as the foundation for ethical influence:

:::incremental
- **Self-awareness** — deep understanding of own values, identity, emotions (connecting to EI, [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd))
- **Relational transparency** — presenting one's genuine self to others
- **Balanced processing** — objectively analyzing relevant data, including challenging information
- **Internalized moral perspective** — self-regulation guided by internal moral standards
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Authentic leadership connects to self-awareness ([Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) and storytelling's "truth to the teller" (Unit 9). A leader who does not know themselves cannot be authentic.

Research shows authentic leadership is positively associated with follower trust, engagement, and organizational citizenship behavior.
:::

## Servant leadership

@greenleaf1977servant proposed that the best leaders are those who **serve first**:

:::fragment
:::medium
> The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. *@greenleaf1977servant*
:::
:::

:::incremental
- **Prioritizing followers' growth** — the leader's primary concern is developing people
- **Stewardship** — holding the organization in trust for a broader community
- **Building community** — fostering genuine connection and shared purpose
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Servant leadership connects to SDT ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)): by prioritizing follower growth, servant leaders naturally satisfy autonomy (empowerment), competence (development), and relatedness (community). It also connects to adaptive leadership ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): servant leaders trust followers to solve problems, creating conditions for adaptive work.
:::

## Sustainable leadership

:::medium
Sustainable leadership extends the leader's responsibility beyond the organization to its **long-term impact** on society and the environment.
:::

:::incremental
- **Long-term organizational health** over short-term results
- **Ecological and social responsibility** — organizations operate within broader systems
- **Intergenerational thinking** — decisions that preserve options for future leaders
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (2 min).**

Sustainable leadership connects to systems thinking (Unit 1): organizations are embedded in broader systems. A leader who optimizes for short-term shareholder value at the expense of sustainability may be creating adaptive challenges that future leaders must address.
:::

## Ethical dilemma exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What would you do? What principles guide your decision?
:::

Choose **one** dilemma to discuss:

1. **The data dilemma:** Your AI system is more profitable using customer data in ways that technically comply with regulations but most customers would object to.
2. **The restructuring:** You must cut 20% of your workforce. Do it quickly (efficient but brutal) or gradually (humane but creates months of uncertainty)?
3. **The cultural clash:** Your most effective sales strategy in a key market involves gift-giving practices considered corruption in your home country but standard locally.

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Structured academic controversy — SAC (12 min total).**

Each group picks ONE dilemma. Within the group, form two pairs:
- Phase 1 (3 min): Pair A argues FOR the most pragmatic/profitable option. Pair B argues FOR the most ethical/principled option. Each pair has 90 seconds to present their case.
- Phase 2 (3 min): SWITCH. Pair A now argues FOR the ethical option. Pair B argues FOR the pragmatic option. 90 seconds each.
- Phase 3 (3 min): All four members drop their assigned positions and seek a genuine synthesis: "What would a leader with behavioral complexity actually do?"

Plenary (3 min): Each group shares their synthesis. Push: "Which ethical framework did you land on? How did stakeholder analysis inform your synthesis?"

The SAC format forces students to take seriously a position they initially opposed — building the cognitive complexity that ethical leadership demands. No "right" answers — the value is in the reasoning process.
:::

# DT synthesis & latticework integration {.headline-only}

## DT as the quintessential adaptive challenge

Return to adaptive leadership [@heifetz1994leadership] from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd): digital transformation is the quintessential **adaptive challenge** — no established playbook, requiring changed behavior at all levels.

:::fragment
:::medium
Consider a CIO leading a cloud migration in a mid-sized manufacturing company. What does she need?
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This synthesis section maps the entire course onto a single challenge. The CIO needs:
- Self-awareness ([Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) — recognizing biases
- Behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)) — holding paradoxes
- Engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)) — motivating resistant teams
- Team building ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)) — creating psychologically safe cross-functional squads
- Political navigation ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) — handling resource conflicts
- Stakeholder management ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)) — engaging board, vendors, unions, users
- Cultural sensitivity (this unit) — adapting for global rollout
- Storytelling (Unit 9) — communicating vision for different audiences

This is the latticework in action: no single model suffices.
:::

## Mapping the course to a DT challenge

:::fragment
| Course concept | Application to DT leadership |
|---|---|
| Self-awareness & traits (Unit 2) | Recognize own biases — e.g., overconfidence in technical solutions |
| Behavioral complexity & CVF (Unit 3) | Hold the paradox of stability AND change simultaneously |
| Engaging leadership & SDT (Unit 4) | Motivate resistant teams through autonomy, competence, relatedness |
| Team development & psych safety (Unit 5) | Build cross-functional squads that can learn and adapt |
| Power & conflict management (Unit 6) | Navigate resource conflicts, build influence without authority |
| Stakeholder management (Unit 7) | Engage board, vendors, unions, end users at appropriate levels |
| Cultural intelligence (Unit 8) | Adapt change approach for global rollout |
| Storytelling (Unit 9) | Communicate vision differently for different audiences |
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
The latticework is not a checklist — it is a **way of seeing** that reveals dimensions of a challenge that any single model would miss.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Walk through the table, connecting each row to a specific aspect of the DT challenge. Emphasize compound value: each model adds a dimension that the others miss. Together, they create a rich, multi-dimensional view.
:::

## DT diagnosis exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Apply the full latticework to a DT challenge.
:::

**Scenario:** A traditional retailer is implementing an omnichannel strategy — integrating online and in-store experiences. The CEO has appointed you as transformation lead.

1. **Diagnose** the leadership challenges using at least 4 course frameworks
2. **Propose** your first 90 days: what do you do first, second, third?
3. **Identify** which frameworks you're using and why

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Expert panel simulation (15 min total: 8 min prep, 5 min presentations, 2 min vote).**

Each group becomes a "consulting firm" hired to advise the transformation lead. They prepare a 90-second diagnosis that must reference at least 4 different course frameworks. Encourage groups to assign internal roles: one person covers adaptive leadership, another stakeholder mapping, another team dynamics, another cultural intelligence.

Presentations (5 min): Each "firm" presents to the class. The audience scores each presentation on two criteria (show of hands): (1) analytical depth and (2) practical actionability.

Vote (2 min): The class votes for the most convincing consulting firm. The winning team briefly explains which framework they found most powerful for this scenario.

Students should draw on the full latticework:
- Adaptive leadership: technical + adaptive challenge
- Stakeholder mapping: store managers, IT, marketing, customers, suppliers, board
- Team development: cross-functional team building
- Political navigation: store manager resistance
- Engaging leadership: motivation during uncertainty
- Cultural intelligence: international rollout adaptation

Highlight: different groups prioritized different frameworks — this demonstrates that the latticework is used selectively based on the leader's diagnosis.
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Your latticework — a visual review

Over eight units, you have built a diverse toolkit of mental models:

| Unit | Key mental models |
|------|------------------|
| 1. Foundations | First principles, inversion, systems thinking, map vs. territory |
| 2. Self | Trait paradoxes, cognitive biases in self-perception, nature–nurture |
| 3. Adaptive behavior | CVF, technical vs. adaptive problems, both/and thinking |
| 4. Leader → Follower | Intrinsic/extrinsic motivation, path-goal contingency, feedback loops |
| 5. Team | Group development stages, psychological safety, complex adaptive systems |
| 6. Organization | Conflict styles, power as relational, game theory |
| 7. Stakeholder | Stakeholder salience, engagement spectrum, coalition logic |
| 8. Context | Cultural dimensions, ethical frameworks, sustainable systems thinking |

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Think of a **leadership story** — a moment where someone's communication made a real difference:

:::incremental
- What made the story **compelling**?
- How did it make you **feel**?
- Can you identify elements of **ethos**, **pathos**, and **logos**?
:::

:::notes
This reflection prepares for Unit 9 on storytelling and leadership communication. Students should arrive with a concrete example of powerful communication they can analyze using Guber's four truths and Aristotle's persuasion model.

"Next session is about storytelling — the skill that makes all other leadership skills communicable. Come prepared with a story that moved you."
