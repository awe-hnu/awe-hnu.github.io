# Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental

1. Explain how cultural dimensions (Hofstede, GLOBE) shape leadership effectiveness across contexts.
2. Compare authentic, servant, and sustainable leadership as ethical frameworks.
3. Integrate all course concepts to diagnose a digital transformation challenge.
4. Reflect on your personal latticework and identify areas for continued development.

# Warm-up {.headline-only}

## Cultural reflection check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Insights from your cultural reflection homework.
:::

Write down one experience where cultural differences affected teamwork or leadership.

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Students write in silence — no talking. The silence models the discomfort of cross-cultural communication where verbal cues are absent, setting the theme for the session.
:::
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Exchange your card with your neighbor. Read silently, then write a response on the back.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

Write a question, a connection to your own experience, or something that surprises you.

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Students write a response on the back of their partner's card: a question, a connection to their own experience, or a surprise (2 min).
Then they read each other's responses silently (1 min). The entire exchange happens in writing — no talking.

This format slows down the conversation, forces careful reading, and models the experience of written-first communication common in cross-cultural virtual teams. Walk around and observe — some pairs will want to talk. Gently redirect them to write.
:::
:::

## Plenary debrief {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What cultural assumptions about teamwork or leadership did you discover? Were any surprising?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Ask: "What was it like to communicate only in writing? What did you notice that you might have missed in a verbal exchange?" (2 min).
Then: "What cultural assumptions about leadership did you discover through the cards?" (3 min).

"The silent dialogue forced you to slow down, read carefully, and respond thoughtfully — exactly the skills cross-cultural leadership demands.
Verbal fluency can mask cultural misunderstandings; writing makes them visible."

Preview: "Today we explore how culture shapes leadership — what works in one context may fail in another."

Connect: "Our latticework of mental models is itself culturally shaped. The models we've studied were largely developed in Western contexts. Today we examine that assumption."

# Revisiting the territory {.headline-only}

## The digital transformation context

In the [foundation unit](../foundations/index.qmd#context-of-leadership), we described the context of leadership in
the digital age: VUCA, digital transformation, and the challenges leaders face.\
You now have seven units of tools. How would you lead through digital transformation?

:::fragment
:::medium
Digital transformation is not a technology problem.\
It is an [**adaptive challenge**](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd) that requires behavioral complexity, engaging
leadership, effective teams, political navigation, and stakeholder management.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Digital transformation is "a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its
properties through combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies"
[@vial2019understanding, p. 118]. But the truly difficult part is not the technology — it is the changed behaviors,
processes, mental models, and organizational culture that the technology demands.

This unit adds the final contextual layers: culture, ethics, and a synthesis of how all course concepts connect in
the face of digital transformation.
:::

## Map vs. territory — revisited

In [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd#map-vs-territory), we introduced Korzybski's principle:
**the map is not the territory**.

:::medium
[Culture is perhaps the ultimate example: our cultural mental models shape everything we see, yet we are often unaware
of them.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [They are the invisible maps through which we interpret all leadership situations.]{.fragment}

What works in one cultural context may fail—or even offend—in another. Effective leadership requires recognizing
which of our assumptions are culturally contingent.

# Cross-cultural leadership {.headline-only}

## Hofstede's cultural dimensions

The cultural dimensions framework [@hofstede1980cultures] identifies six dimensions along which national cultures vary.
Each dimension is a **mental model** for understanding cultural differences:

:::medium
[Power distance,]{.fragment}
[individualism vs. collectivism,]{.fragment}
[uncertainty avoidance,]{.fragment}
[masculinity vs. femininity,]{.fragment}\
[long-term vs. short-term orientation,]{.fragment}
[and indulgence vs. restraint^[Indulgence vs. restraint was added in 2021 [@hofstede2010cultures]]]{.fragment}
:::

:::fragment
Each dimension is a range of values, and there is a lot of variation in any culture. These are tendencies, not
absolutes.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
- **Power distance:** the degree to which less powerful members accept unequal power distribution. High: Malaysia,
  Philippines. Low: Austria, Denmark.
- **Individualism vs. collectivism:** the degree to which people are integrated into groups. Individualist: USA, UK.
  Collectivist: China, Japan.
- **Uncertainty avoidance:** the degree to which members feel uncomfortable with ambiguity. High: Greece, Japan. Low:
  Singapore, Denmark.
- **Masculinity vs. femininity:** the degree to which gender roles are distinct. Masculine cultures (Japan, Hungary)
  value competitiveness, assertiveness, and material success. Feminine cultures (Sweden, Norway) value cooperation,
  caring, and quality of life.
- **Long-term vs. short-term orientation:** the degree to which a society maintains links with its past while dealing
  with present and future challenges. Long-term: China, Japan. Short-term: USA, UK.
- **Indulgence vs. restraint:** the degree to which a society allows relatively free gratification of basic human
  desires. The dimension was added in 2021 [@hofstede2010cultures]. Indulgent: Mexico, Nigeria. Restrained: Russia,
  China.

Each dimension is a continuum, not a binary. And individual variation within any culture is enormous; these are
tendencies, not determinisms. As @hofstede1980cultures warned: "Culture is not a characteristic of individuals; it
encompasses a number of people who were conditioned by the same education and life experience."

For leaders, the practical value is not in memorizing country scores but in developing the *awareness* that cultural
differences exist and the *curiosity* to discover how they manifest in specific situations.

## The GLOBE study

The GLOBE study (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness) [@house2004culture] extended Hofstede's
work by studying leadership specifically across 62 cultures.

:::fragment
Key finding: **six culturally endorsed leadership dimensions**:
:::

:::incremental
- **Charismatic/value-based:** visionary, inspirational, self-sacrificing [universally valued]{.highlight}
- **Team-oriented:** collaborative, team-integrating, diplomatic [universally valued]{.highlight}
- **Participative:** involving others in decision-making [culturally contingent]{.highlight}
- **Humane-oriented:** modest, compassionate, generous [culturally contingent]{.highlight}
- **Autonomous:** independent, self-reliant [culturally contingent]{.highlight}
- **Self-protective:** status-conscious, face-saving, procedural [culturally contingent]{.highlight}
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The GLOBE study's key contribution is showing that *some* aspects of leadership are universal while *others* are
culturally contingent:

- **Universal:** Charismatic and team-oriented leadership are valued across virtually all cultures studied. This
  suggests
  that vision, integrity, and team-building are foundational leadership qualities regardless of context.
- **Culturally contingent:** Participative leadership is highly valued in Western, individualist cultures but less so in
  high power-distance cultures. Autonomous leadership is valued in some cultures (Germanic Europe) but seen negatively
  in
  others (Latin America). Self-protective leadership is seen as positive in some South Asian and Middle Eastern cultures
  but negative in Northern European and Anglo cultures.

Leaders working across cultures need to distinguish between their *universal* leadership
behaviors (which they can rely on) and their *culturally contingent* behaviors (which they need to adapt). This is
behavioral complexity applied to the cultural dimension.
:::

:::

## Cultural intelligence

:::medium
**Cultural intelligence (CQ)** is the capability to function effectively across cultural contexts.
:::

:::fragment
The *Four-Factor Model of Cultural Intelligence* identifies four components of CQ [@ang2007cultural]:
:::

:::incremental
- **CQ Drive:** motivation to learn about and engage with other cultures
- **CQ Knowledge:** understanding of cultural norms, practices, and conventions
- **CQ Strategy:** ability to plan for and make sense of culturally diverse encounters
- **CQ Action:** ability to adapt behavior appropriately in cross-cultural situations
:::

:::fragment
Like [emotional intelligence](../leader/index.qmd#emotional-intelligence), cultural intelligence is
**developable:** it improves with deliberate exposure, reflection, and practice.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
CQ is particularly relevant for digital leaders because digital transformation often spans cultural boundaries: global
teams, international stakeholders, cross-cultural customer bases. A leader who excels in a single cultural context may
struggle when leading across cultures — not because of a lack of competence, but because of a lack of cultural
adaptability.

CQ builds on several concepts from earlier units: self-awareness ([Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd#self-awareness)) is the
foundation for
recognizing your own cultural biases. Behavioral
complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd#behavioral-complexity)) is required to
flex your leadership style across cultural contexts. Stakeholder empathy must include cultural empathy to be truly
effective.

## Cross-cultural leadership exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
How would leadership approach differ across cultures?
:::

**Scenario:** You are leading a global AI-chatbot product team with members from Germany, Japan, Brazil, and the USA. You need to make a critical decision about the product roadmap. Each cultural context has different expectations about decision-making, communication, and hierarchy.

- Let's assign each cultural role to a student.
- They then simulate a product roadmap meeting where each person stays in character.

{{< countdown "7:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Culture simulation game (14 min total: 10 min simulation, 4 min debrief).**

Preparation (before class): Create 4 sets of "cultural norm" cards:

- **German cards**: "You expect a structured agenda. Decisions need data. Speak directly and concisely."
- **Japanese cards**: "Build consensus before the meeting. Avoid public disagreement. Silence means thinking, not agreement."
- **Brazilian cards**: "Relationships come first. Small talk matters. Hierarchy is respected but warmth is expected."
- **American cards**: "Speak up immediately. The best idea wins. Decisions should be fast and individual."

After 7 minutes, freeze: "How did it feel? Where did friction arise?"

Debrief (4 min):

- Which cultural dimensions caused the most friction?
-
Expected: power distance × decision-making speed, collectivism × individual accountability.

Connect to behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): the leader must hold multiple cultural frames simultaneously.

# Cross-boundary leadership {.headline-only}

## Cross-functional collaboration

:::medium
[In the digital age, **cross-functional collaboration** is the norm, not the exception]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [Most leaders must influence
across hierarchies, functions, and geographies simultaneously.]{.fragment}
:::

:::fragment
Key challenges:
:::

:::incremental
- **Competing loyalties:** team members report to multiple managers with potentially conflicting
  priorities [@sy2005challenges]
- **Information asymmetry:** different functions have different data, perspectives, and jargon [@carlile2002pragmatic]
- **Coordination costs:** every boundary crossed adds communication overhead
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Cross-boundary leadership is where several units' concepts converge in practice:

- [**Lateral leadership: **](../conflict-power/index.qmd#lateral-leadership) influencing without formal authority is
  the primary skill
- [**Stakeholder management:**](../stakeholder/index.qmd) every function, geography, and hierarchy level is a
  stakeholder group
- [**Cultural intelligence:**](index.qmd#cultural-intelligence) functional cultures (engineering culture vs. marketing
  culture) can be as different as national cultures
- [**Engaging leadership:**](../motivation/index.qmd#engaging-leadership) maintaining motivation and engagement across
  boundaries requires attention to SDT needs in contexts where you have limited formal control

Cross-functional leadership is essentially Boundary Spanning. As @carlile2002pragmatic demonstrates, the challenge isn't just
communication—it's translation. Leaders must act as *Boundary Spanners* who create *Boundary Objects* (like your
stakeholder maps or a shared project charter) to give different functions a common language. Without this, *Information Asymmetry*
leads to mistrust, and *Competing Loyalties* lead to gridlock.

The leader who can navigate these boundaries effectively is increasingly the leader who creates the most value in
complex organizations.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Cross-boundary leadership is where several units' concepts converge:

- **Lateral leadership** ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) — influencing without formal authority
- **Stakeholder management** ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)) — every function is a stakeholder group
- **Cultural intelligence** (this unit) — functional cultures can be as different as national cultures
- **Engaging leadership** ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)) — maintaining motivation across boundaries

The leader who navigates these boundaries effectively creates the most value in complex organizations.
:::
:::

## Geographically distributed teams

Building on [Unit 5](../team/index.qmd#leading-virtual-teamsr)'s treatment of virtual teams, the cultural dimension adds a layer of complexity:

:::incremental
- **Communication style differences:** direct (Germanic, Anglo) vs. indirect (Asian, Latin American) communication
  norms create misunderstandings
- **Time orientation:** monochronic (one thing at a time, punctuality) vs. polychronic (flexible time, relationships
  first) cultures clash in scheduling and deadlines
- **Decision-making norms:** consensus-driven (Japanese *nemawashi*) vs. top-down (many hierarchical cultures) vs.
  debate-driven (Dutch *poldermodel*) approaches to decisions
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
The adaptive leader's task: create shared norms that respect cultural differences while enabling effective collaboration.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This extends the virtual team practices from [Unit 5](../team/index.qmd): structured communication rhythms, explicit norms, and intentional relationship building are even more critical when cultural differences add another layer of complexity.

Ask: "What explicit norms would you establish for a culturally diverse virtual team?" Collect 2–3 responses briefly.
:::
:::

# Ethical leadership {.headline-only}

## Why integrity matters

:::medium
[Trust is the foundation of leadership, built on the observer's perception of the leader's integrity: ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[the belief that the leader adheres to a set of principles that the trustor finds acceptable [@mayer1995integrative].]{.fragment}
:::

:::fragment
When leaders do not act with integrity, the damage extends far beyond the immediate situation:
:::

:::incremental
- Follower commitment erodes ([engaging leadership](../motivation/index.qmd#engaging-leadership), depends on trust)
- [Psychological safety](../team/index.qmd#psychological-safety) collapses (if the leader can't be trusted, no one feels safe)
- [Social capital](../stakeholder/index.qmd#social-capital-theory) is destroyed (the relational dimension depends on trust and norms)
- Organizational legitimacy is undermined (stakeholder salience shifts as legitimacy is questioned)
:::

## Authentic leadership

Authentic leadership theory emphasizes the leader's **genuine self** as the foundation for effective and ethical
influence [@walumbwa2008authentic]:

:::incremental
- **Self-Awareness:** It's not just "knowing yourself"; it's knowing how your behavior affects others. It's the "mirror" factor. Walumbwa et al. argue this is the prerequisite for the other three.
- **Relational Transparency:** This is about self-disclosure. It builds trust because it reduces the "hidden agenda" fear in followers. However, it's not "oversharing"—it's sharing the relevant truth to build a bridge.
- **Balanced Processing:** This is essentially intellectual honesty. It means the leader actively seeks out "the dissenting voice" (see also [psychological safety](../team/index.qmd#psychological-safety))
- **Internalized Moral Perspective:** This is the "Compass." It's the opposite of being a "chameleon" leader who changes their values to please whichever stakeholder is in the room.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Authentic leadership connects strongly to the "truth to the teller" principle in [storytelling](../communication/index.qmd#storytelling):
a leader who does not know themselves cannot be authentic, and a storyteller who is not genuine cannot inspire lasting trust.

Research shows that authentic leadership is positively associated with follower trust, engagement, job satisfaction, and
organizational citizenship behavior [@gardner2011authentic]. Followers are remarkably perceptive at detecting inauthenticity — and when they do,
the leader's influence evaporates.

## Servant leadership

@greenleaf1977servant proposed that the best leaders are those who **serve first**:

:::fragment
:::medium
The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead
[@greenleaf1977servant].
:::
:::

:::fragment
Core practices of servant leadership:
:::

:::incremental
- **Prioritizing followers' growth:** the leader's primary concern is developing the people they lead
- **Stewardship:** the leader holds the organization in trust for a broader community, not for personal gain
- **Building community:** the leader fosters genuine connection and shared purpose among followers
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Servant leadership inverts the traditional power hierarchy: instead of followers serving the leader's vision, the leader
serves the followers' development. This may sound idealistic, but research shows that servant leadership is associated
with stronger team performance, higher trust, and greater organizational citizenship behavior.

Servant leadership connects to [SDT](../motivation/index.qmd#self-determination-theory): by prioritizing follower growth, servant leaders
naturally satisfy autonomy (empowerment), competence (development), and relatedness (community) needs. It also connects
to the "giving the work back" principle of [adaptive leadership](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd#adaptive-leadership): servant
leaders trust their followers to solve problems, creating the conditions for adaptive work.

## Sustainable leadership

:::medium
Sustainable leadership extends the leader's responsibility beyond the organization to its **long-term impact** on
society and the environment [@avery2011sustainable].
:::

:::fragment
Key principles:
:::

:::incremental
- **Long-term organizational health** over short-term results — resisting the pressure to sacrifice future capacity for
  current performance
- **Ecological and social responsibility** — recognizing that organizations operate within broader systems and have
  obligations to those systems
- **Intergenerational thinking** — making decisions that preserve options and resources for future leaders and
  stakeholders
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Sustainable leadership connects to systems thinking: organizations are embedded in broader social and
ecological systems, and their actions have second- and third-order consequences. A leader who optimizes for short-term
shareholder value at the expense of environmental sustainability or employee wellbeing may be creating challenges
that future leaders will have to address.

## Ethical dilemma exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What would you do?\
What principles guide your decision?
:::

Make group of two and choose **one** dilemma to discuss:

1. **The data dilemma:** Your AI system is more profitable using customer data in ways that technically comply with regulations but most customers would object to.
2. **The restructuring:** You must cut 20% of your workforce. Do it quickly (efficient but brutal) or gradually (humane but creates months of uncertainty)?

Have two rounds à 3 minutes: In round #1, A argues for the most pragmatic/profitable option, B argues for the most ethical/principled option.
Each student has 90 seconds. For round #2 switch roles. Lastly, seek a genuine synthesis.

all of them — and the judgment to know which to apply when.

## Your latticework — a review

Over eight units, you have built a diverse toolkit of mental models:

:::smaller
| Unit                 | Key mental models                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Foundations       | First principles, inversion, systems thinking, map vs. territory         |
| 2. Leader            | Trait paradoxes, cognitive biases in self-perception, nature–nurture     |
| 3. Adaptive behavior | CVF, technical vs. adaptive problems, both/and thinking                  |
| 4. Motivation        | Intrinsic/extrinsic motivation, path-goal contingency, feedback loops    |
| 5. Team              | Group development stages, psychological safety, complex adaptive systems |
| 6. Conflict & Power  | Conflict styles, power as relational, game theory                        |
| 7. Stakeholder       | Stakeholder salience, engagement spectrum, coalition logic               |
| 8. Context           | Cultural dimensions, ethical frameworks, sustainable systems thinking    |

## The map is still not the territory

Revisit Parrish's *map vs. territory*:

:::medium
Our latticework is still a map. Reality is always richer, messier, and more
surprising than any framework can capture.
:::

:::fragment
The value of the latticework is not that it gives you all the answers — but that it gives you **better questions** and
**more options** when facing complex leadership challenges.

# Q&A {.headline-only .html-hidden .unlisted}


# Homework

Think of a **leadership story** — a moment where someone's communication made a real difference:

- What made the story **compelling**?
- How did it make you **feel**?
- Can you identify elements of **ethos**, **pathos**, and **logos**?
