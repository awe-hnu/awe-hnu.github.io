135 minutes total. 

The session is designed as a flipped classroom — students have pre-read @judge2002personality and answered three guiding questions. 

- Front-load the pre-reading payoff in Block 3 so students immediately see value in having prepared. 
- The jigsaw in Block 5 covers Goleman's EI skills as new content discovery.
- Keep transitions brisk and time-box group work strictly.

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. Trace the evolution of leadership thought from Great Man theory to complexity leadership.
2. Analyze how the Big Five personality traits relate to leadership emergence and effectiveness.
3. Explain the LTEE model and the interplay of genetics, traits, and context in leader emergence.
4. Assess both the bright and dark sides of personality traits in leadership contexts.
5. Reflect on your own trait profile and emotional intelligence as a foundation for leadership development.
:::

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Latticework check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What mental models from [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd) might help us think about leader traits?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}


:::notes
**Plenary warm-up (5 min).** 

Let 2–3 students respond briefly. 
Land on the map vs. territory connection: trait models are useful simplifications, not the full picture.

> Traits are a map of personality, not the full person. Any trait model simplifies a rich, complex human being into measurable dimensions. Useful, but incomplete.

Alternatives: circle of competence, second-order thinking, VUCA.
:::

## Individual reflection {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Write down your findings.
:::

1. **One key finding** from @judge2002personality that **confirmed** something you expected.
2. **One finding** that **surprised** you.

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Individual writing (5 min).** 

Hand out index cards or have students use a sheet of paper. 
This activates the pre-reading and gives you a quick diagnostic of engagement. 

Do not discuss yet — that comes in the pair share.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Turn to your neighbor\
and compare your findings.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

Where do you agree? Where did your surprises differ?

:::notes
**Pair share (5 min).** 

This lowers the barrier before plenary discussion and surfaces the diversity of takeaways. 
Walk around the room and listen in — note interesting threads you can pick up later in Block 3. 
No plenary report-out here; the energy flows directly into Block 2.

# Evolution of leadership thought {.headline-only}

## A brief history

Before we examine what specific traits matter, it helps to understand how our *thinking about leadership* has evolved. 

:::medium
Each era emphasized different aspects\
— and each left useful mental models behind.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (10 min).** 
Walk through the six paradigms briskly.
:::

## Great Man Theory (1840s)

:::medium
Great leaders **are born**, not made.
:::

@carlyle1841heroes argued that history is shaped by exceptional individuals with innate heroic qualities. Leadership was seen as a gift bestowed on a select few — typically male, aristocratic, and military.

:::notes
The Great Man Theory reflects the 19th-century belief that leadership capacity is inherent and cannot be developed. While largely discredited, it planted the seed for trait-based research: if great leaders are "different," what exactly makes them different? This question drove decades of subsequent research.
:::

## Trait approaches (1930s–1940s)

:::medium
Leadership depends on the\
**personal qualities** of the leader.
:::

Early researchers sought universal traits that distinguish leaders from non-leaders.
Initial reviews [e.g., @stogdill1948personal] found inconsistent results, leading many to abandon the trait approach — until meta-analyses revived it decades later.

:::notes
The trait approach represents a more scientific evolution of the Great Man idea. Rather than assuming leaders are "born great," researchers tried to *measure* what traits correlate with leadership. The approach fell out of favor mid-century because no single trait seemed universally predictive. It was later revived with more sophisticated methods — notably the Big Five framework and the meta-analysis the students read.
:::

## Behavioral theories (1950s–1960s)

:::medium
If traits alone don't explain leadership, perhaps **what leaders do** matters more than who they are.
:::

- **Ohio State Studies** identified *initiating structure* (task-oriented) and *consideration* (relationship-oriented) as key leadership behaviors [@Fleishman1953].
- **Michigan Studies** distinguished *production-oriented* and *employee-oriented* leadership [@Katz1950].

:::notes
The behavioral approach shifted the focus from traits to observable actions. Its key insight: leadership can be *learned* through developing the right behaviors. This opened the door to leadership development programs. However, the approach struggled to account for the fact that the same behaviors work well in some situations but not others — which led to contingency theories.
:::

## Contingency & situational theories (1960s–1970s)

:::medium
There is no single best way to lead.\
**Effectiveness depends on the situation**.
:::

- **Fiedler's Contingency Model** [@fiedler1967theory] — leader effectiveness depends on the match between leadership style and situational favorability.
- **Hersey & Blanchard's Situational Leadership** [@hersey1977management] — leaders should adapt their style based on follower readiness.

:::notes
Contingency theories reject the idea of universally effective leadership and argue that context matters. Fiedler proposed that leaders have relatively fixed styles and should be matched to appropriate situations. Hersey and Blanchard took a more flexible view, arguing leaders can and should adapt. We will revisit situational and adaptive leadership in depth in Unit 3.
:::

## Transformational leadership (1980s–1990s)

:::medium
Leaders transform followers **by inspiring them** to transcend self-interest for the sake of the organization.
:::

- @burns1978leadership distinguished **transactional** (exchange-based) from **transformational** (purpose-based) leadership.
- @bass1985leadership operationalized it: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.

:::notes
Transformational leadership brought emotion, vision, and meaning back into the conversation. It explained why some leaders inspire extraordinary commitment while others — equally competent — do not. Strong empirical support. Connects directly to storytelling in Unit 9.
:::

## Complexity & adaptive leadership (2000s+)

:::medium
In complex adaptive systems, leadership is **distributed**, **emergent**, and **contextual**.
:::

- @uhl2007complexity introduced **Complexity Leadership Theory** conceptualizing leadership as enabling adaptability in complex systems
- @heifetz1994leadership introduced **Adaptive Leadership** distinguishing technical problems (known solutions) from adaptive challenges (require learning and changed behavior)

:::notes
These theories reflect the VUCA world from Unit 1. The "heroic leader" model is insufficient in highly complex environments. Leadership must be understood as a system-level phenomenon that emerges through interactions. We explore adaptive leadership in depth in Unit 3.
:::

## Paradigm pitch {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Prepare a **60-second pitch** for one paradigm.
:::

1. Why is your paradigm's mental model **still useful today**?
2. Give a **concrete example** from the digital era.

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group task (10 min, groups of 3–4).** 

- Assign paradigms by table or draw randomly (prepare cards labeled: Trait, Behavioral, Contingency, Transformational, Complexity — skip Great Man). 
- Give exactly 5 minutes for preparation, then 60-second pitches. 
- After each pitch, add one sentence of commentary connecting it to the broader arc. 
- End by showing the synthesis table on the next slide.
:::

## The map of leadership theory

Each paradigm offers a **mental model** — and each remains partially useful:

| Era              | Core mental model                | Still useful for...       |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Traits           | Individual differences matter    | Self-awareness, selection |
| Behavioral       | Actions can be learned           | Leadership development    |
| Contingency      | Context determines effectiveness | Situational judgment      |
| Transformational | Vision inspires commitment       | Organizational change     |
| Complexity       | Systems produce emergence        | Digital transformation    |

:::notes
**Plenary synthesis (5 min).** Show this table as the capstone. Emphasize: no single paradigm "won." This is precisely the latticework idea — effective leadership thinking requires multiple models. In this unit, we focus on the trait lens with the understanding that it is one map among many. Transition to Block 3: "So let's look more closely at the trait map you explored in your pre-reading."
:::

# The Big Five & paradoxes {.headline-only}

## What distinguishes leaders? {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What traits **distinguish leaders**\
from other people?
:::

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}


:::notes
**Plenary discussion (10 min).** 

- Open the floor — collect answers on the board. 
- Then reveal the regression figure on the next slide. 
- Probe the findings students found surprising (reference their index cards from Block 1). 
- Push on these questions: 
  - Why is extraversion dominant for emergence but less so for effectiveness? 
  - Why is agreeableness nearly irrelevant — is that a problem? 
  - What does this mean for introverted leaders?
:::


## Big Fixe x leadership

![Regression of Leadership on Big Five Traits according to the meta study of @judge2002personality](images/leadershipBigFive.svg){#fig-bigFive fig-align="left"}

:::notes
Key findings to highlight:

- **Extraversion** is the most important trait for leadership overall, but more strongly related to emergence than effectiveness.
- **Conscientiousness** and **Openness to Experience** were the strongest and most consistent correlates alongside extraversion.
- **Agreeableness** was the least relevant trait.
- **Neuroticism** failed to emerge as a significant predictor.
- Traits are better predictors when observers have limited opportunity to observe behavior (student samples). This may reflect stereotypical conceptions of leaders rather than actual effectiveness.

Probe: "Does this mean we should select leaders based on extraversion?" Push students toward nuance.
:::

##  Trait paradoxes {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Analyze a **Big Five trait** 
:::

Work through these questions:

1. Summarize the **bright side** and **dark side** of your trait.
2. Create a **concrete leadership scenario** where the trait helps — and one where it **backfires**.
3. Is this trait **more or less important in the digital era**? Why?

{{< countdown "15:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group work (15 min, groups of 4–5).** 

- Assign one trait per group (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Openness). 
- Encourage groups to think beyond the table — create vivid, specific scenarios (e.g., "An extraverted leader dominates a Zoom call and misses quiet dissent from remote team members"). 
- Walk around and push groups that finish early to deepen their digital-era argument.
:::

## Trait paradoxes {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Present your **two scenarios**\
and your **digital-era verdict**.
:::

:::notes
**Plenary report-out (10 min).** Max 2 minutes per group. Build the full paradox table on the board collaboratively as groups present — this is more engaging than showing a pre-made table. After all groups have presented, highlight the overarching pattern: every strength has a shadow. This is itself a mental model worth adding to the latticework: **trait paradoxes**.

| Trait               | Bright Side                                       | Dark Side                                          |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Extraversion        | Greater leadership emergence; higher satisfaction | More impulsive behaviors; dominates airtime        |
| Agreeableness       | Higher well-being; lower conflict                 | Lower career success; avoids necessary conflict    |
| Conscientiousness   | Stronger performance; lower deviance              | Reduced adaptability; slower early learning        |
| Emotional stability | Better performance; effective leadership          | Poorer risk detection; complacency                 |
| Openness            | Higher creativity; greater adaptability           | More counterproductive behaviors; lower commitment |

**So traits matter, but they have paradoxes. Where do traits actually come from? And how do they translate into leadership? That's the LTEE model.**

:::notes
**Mini-lecture start (8 min total).** 

Acknowledge the grain of truth — twin studies show 30–60% heritability for leadership tendencies. 
But heritability is never 100%, and expression depends on environment. 
Use the quote: 

> Asking how much a particular individual's attitudes or traits are due to heredity versus the environment is nonsensical, just like asking whether a leaky basement is caused more by the crack in the foundation or the water outside *@olson2001heritability [pp. 845–846]*

1. **Genetics** — foundational biological basis. Genetic predispositions influence personality, cognition, emotional regulation.
2. **Selection processes** — evolutionary and organizational mechanisms that select certain traits in or out.
3. **Traits** — individual characteristics. The Big Five we just discussed.
4. **Mediators** — the bridge between traits and emergence. Based on Socioanalytic Theory: conscientious/extraverted/stable individuals are motivated to *get ahead* (agency); extraverted/agreeable individuals *go along* (communion); intelligent/charismatic individuals *provide meaning*.
5. **Emergence --> Effectiveness** — emergence is context-dependent (as adaptive challenges increase, leadership becomes more important). Effectiveness splits into subjective (reputation, follower satisfaction) and objective (productivity, goal achievement).

6. Genetics set a range; mediators and context determine where in that range you land. This is where development happens.
:::

## Think-Pair-Share {.discussion-slide}

If traits have a genetic source,\
can leadership really be **developed**?
:::

Where in the LTEE model do you see **room for development**?

:::small
2 minutes individual thinking\
3 minutes pair discussion.
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Think-Pair-Share (7 min).** Individual thinking (2 min) — pair discussion (3 min) — collect 3–4 responses in plenary (2 min). Expected answers: mediators (motives and skills can be trained), context (you can seek the right situations), selection processes (organizations can design better pipelines). If students focus only on traits, redirect: "The model shows traits are just one input — what about the arrows between boxes?"

**Plenary synthesis (5 min).** Land the key insight: the LTEE model shows that trait-based determinism is too simple. Development happens at the mediator level — and one of the most researched mediator frameworks is emotional intelligence. Bridge: "Goleman argues that EI is precisely what can be learned. Let's explore that."
:::

# Emotional intelligence {.headline-only}

## What sets great leaders apart?

:::medium
Intelligence is the most "successful" trait\
in social and applied psychology [@judge2009bright].
:::

@goleman1998makes argues that it is not IQ, but **emotional intelligence** that makes great leaders.

:::fragment
Emotional intelligence is a group of **five skills** that enable the best leaders to maximize their own and their followers' performance.
:::

:::fragment
- **Self-awareness** — knowing one's strengths, weaknesses, drives, values, and impact on others.
- **Self-regulation** — controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods.
- **Motivation** — relishing achievement for its own sake.
- **Empathy** — understanding other people's emotional makeup and treating them accordingly.
- **Social skill** — building rapport with others to move them in desired directions.
:::

:::notes
Brief framing (2 min) before the jigsaw. 

- Connect EI to the LTEE model: emotional intelligence operates at the mediator level — it translates traits into effective leadership behaviors. 
- Goleman's central claim is that EI can be learned, which makes it the actionable lever in the model. 
- Introduce the five skills very briefly, then move directly into the jigsaw.
:::

## EQ skills — research {.discussion-slide}

In your group (one EI skill per group), do this:

:::incremental
1. **Research** the core characteristics of your skill.
2. **Find or construct** a concrete leadership example.
3. Identify **one pathway** to strengthen this skill.
4. Is this skill **gaining or losing importance** in digital/hybrid work? Why?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
- Form five groups, one per EI skill. 
- Provide a 1-page excerpt from @goleman1998makes per skill (prepare handouts in advance) or direct students to the relevant section. 
- Walk around and ensure groups are producing concrete examples, not just paraphrasing definitions. 
- Push groups that finish early on the digital-era question — this is where the richest discussion happens.
:::


## EQ skills — share {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Regroup into **mixed teams** — one expert per skill.
:::

Each expert: teach your skill to the group in **2 minutes**.

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}


## EQ skills — development {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Which EI skill is the **hardest to develop**?
:::

Which would have the **most impact** for digital leaders?

:::notes
Open discussion. 

Expected patterns: 
- students often identify self-regulation as hardest (requires sustained effort against ingrained patterns) and empathy as most impactful for digital contexts (harder to read people through screens). 
- Push back if consensus forms too quickly — "Is empathy really harder digitally, or do we just need different signals?"

Land on Goleman's foundational argument: 

> Self-awareness is the prerequisite for all other EI skills. A leader who doesn't understand their own emotional patterns cannot regulate them, cannot authentically motivate, cannot accurately read others. 
> 
This connects to the cognitive biases discussion from Unit 1 — our self-image is another map that may not match the territory.
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Self-awareness as foundation

Self-awareness — the first component of emotional intelligence — is arguably the **foundation of all leadership development**.

:::fragment
:::medium
Leaders who understand their own strengths, weaknesses, values, and emotional patterns can better manage themselves, relate to others, and adapt to different situations.
:::
:::

:::notes
Connect self-awareness to the full arc of the session: 
- we started with traits (the map), 
- saw that they have paradoxes (the territory is more complex), 
- learned that development happens through mediators like EI, 
- and now arrive at the starting point of all development — knowing yourself.
:::

## Personal reflection {.discussion-slide}

Based on what you have learned about the Big Five and emotional intelligence:

:::incremental
1. **Where do you see your strengths?**\
   Which traits and EI skills come naturally to you?
2. **Where are your potential dark sides?**\
   Every strength has a shadow. Where might your strengths become liabilities?
3. **What is your development edge?**\
   Which EI skill, if strengthened, would have the greatest impact on your leadership?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Individual reflection (5 min).** 

This is private writing — not shared with the group. 
Emphasize that this is not about labeling yourself but about building the habit of reflective self-assessment that characterizes effective leaders. 
Suggest the IPIP Big Five short form as an optional follow-up tool for students who want empirical data to supplement their self-reflection.

Remember: as @goleman1998makes notes, emotional intelligence *can be learned*. The first step is honest self-assessment — and the willingness to act on what you find.
:::

## Latticework update {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
New models added to your latticework:
:::

:::incremental
- Cognitive biases in self-perception and other-perception
- Nature–nurture interaction as a thinking framework
- Trait paradoxes — every strength has a shadow
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).** 
Collect these on the board alongside the Unit 1 models. 

Ask: "How do these new models connect to the ones we already had?" 
Expected connection: map vs. territory applies to self-perception (our self-image is a map); second-order thinking applies to trait paradoxes (the second-order effect of a strength is often a weakness).

Preview the homework: @lavine2014paradoxical on paradoxical leadership and the CVF. Connect it explicitly to today's trait paradoxes — "If every trait has a bright and dark side, how do leaders manage both simultaneously? That's what Lavine calls behavioral complexity."
