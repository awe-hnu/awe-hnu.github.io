# Evolution of leadership {.headline-only}

## A brief history

Before we examine what specific traits matter, it helps to understand how our *thinking about leadership* has evolved. Each era emphasized different aspects — and each left useful mental models behind.

## Great Man Theory (1840s)

:::medium
Great leaders **are born**, not made.
:::

:::fragment
@carlyle1841heroes argued that history is shaped by exceptional individuals with innate heroic qualities. Leadership was seen as a gift bestowed on a select few — typically male, aristocratic, and military.
:::

:::notes
The Great Man Theory reflects the 19th-century belief that leadership capacity is inherent and cannot be developed. While largely discredited, it planted the seed for trait-based research: if great leaders are "different," what exactly makes them different? This question drove decades of subsequent research.
:::

## Trait approaches (1930s–1940s)

:::medium
Leadership depends on the **personal qualities** of the leader.
:::

:::fragment
Early researchers sought universal traits that distinguish leaders from non-leaders. 

Initial reviews [e.g., @stogdill1948personal] found inconsistent results, leading many to abandon the trait approach — until meta-analyses revived it decades later.
:::

:::notes
The trait approach represents a more scientific evolution of the Great Man idea. Rather than assuming leaders are "born great," researchers tried to *measure* what traits correlate with leadership. The approach fell out of favor mid-century because no single trait seemed universally predictive. It was later revived with more sophisticated methods — notably the Big Five framework and meta-analyses like @judge2002personality.
:::

## Behavioral theories (1950s–1960s)

:::medium
If traits alone don't explain leadership, perhaps **what leaders do** matters more than who they are.
:::

:::fragment
Two important research programs:
:::

:::incremental
- **Ohio State Studies** identified *initiating structure* (task-oriented) and *consideration* (relationship-oriented) as key leadership behaviors [@Fleishman1953].
- **Michigan Studies** distinguished *production-oriented* and *employee-oriented* leadership [@Katz1950].
:::

:::notes
The behavioral approach shifted the focus from traits to observable actions. Its key insight: leadership can be *learned* through developing the right behaviors, not just born. This opened the door to leadership development programs. However, the approach struggled to account for the fact that the same behaviors work well in some situations but not others — which led to contingency theories.
:::

## Contingency & situational theories (1960s–1970s)

:::medium
There is no single best way to lead.\
**Effectiveness depends on the situation**.
:::

:::fragment
Key models:
:::

:::incremental
- **Fiedler's Contingency Model** [@fiedler1967theory] states that leader effectiveness depends on the match between leadership style and situational favorability.
- **Hersey & Blanchard's Situational Leadership** [@hersey1977management] advices leaders to adapt their style (telling — selling — participating — delegating) based on follower readiness.
:::

:::notes
Contingency theories represent a major conceptual leap: they reject the idea of universally effective leadership and instead argue that context matters. @fiedler1967theory proposed that leaders have relatively fixed styles and should be matched to appropriate situations. @hersey1977management took a more flexible view, arguing leaders can and should adapt. We will revisit situational and adaptive leadership in depth in Unit 3.
:::

## Transformational & charismatic leadership (1980s–1990s)

:::medium
Leaders transform followers **by inspiring them** to transcend self-interest for the sake of the organization.
:::

:::incremental
- @burns1978leadership distinguished **transactional leadership** (exchange-based) from **transformational leadership** (purpose-based).
- @bass1985leadership operationalized **transformational leadership**: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.
:::

:::notes
Transformational leadership theory brought emotion, vision, and meaning back into the leadership conversation. It explained why some leaders inspire extraordinary commitment while others — equally competent — do not. The theory has strong empirical support and remains one of the most widely studied leadership frameworks. Its emphasis on *vision* and *inspiration* connects directly to our later unit on storytelling (Unit 9).
:::

## Complexity & adaptive leadership (2000s+)

:::medium
In complex adaptive systems, leadership is **distributed**, **emergent**, and **contextual**.
:::

:::incremental
- @uhl2007complexity introduced **Complexity Leadership Theory** conceptualizing leadership as enabling adaptability in complex systems
- @heifetz1994leadership introduced **Adaptive Leadership** distinguishing technical problems (known solutions) from adaptive challenges (require learning and changed behavior)
:::

:::notes
Complexity and adaptive leadership theories reflect the realities of the VUCA world we discussed in [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd#the-decision-making-crisis). They argue that in highly complex, interconnected environments, the "heroic leader" model is insufficient. Instead, leadership must be understood as a system-level phenomenon that emerges through interactions. We will explore the adaptive leadership framework [@heifetz1994leadership] in depth in Unit 3.
:::

## The map of leadership theory

Each paradigm offers a **mental model** for understanding leadership — and each remains partially useful:

| Era              | Core mental model                | Still useful for...       |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Traits           | Individual differences matter    | Self-awareness, selection |
| Behavioral       | Actions can be learned           | Leadership development    |
| Contingency      | Context determines effectiveness | Situational judgment      |
| Transformational | Vision inspires commitment       | Organizational change     |
| Complexity       | Systems produce emergence        | Digital transformation    |

:::notes
No single paradigm "won." Each added a lens that the others lacked. This is precisely the latticework idea from [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd#latticework-thinking): effective leadership thinking requires multiple models. In this unit, we focus on the trait lens — with the understanding that it is one map among many.

:::notes

The Big Five traits have been found to be relevant to many aspects of life, such as subjective well-being [e.g., @deneve1998happy] and even longevity [@friedman1995childhood]. They also provide a valuable taxonomy for the study of leadership [@judge2002personality].

Openness to Experience
: This trait reflects **a person's willingness to explore new ideas, be curious, and engage with novel experiences**. Those high in openness tend to be creative, imaginative, and interested in art, music, and diverse cultural experiences. They're often intellectually curious and comfortable with abstract thinking. Those lower in openness may prefer familiarity, concrete thinking, and conventional approaches.

Conscientiousness
: This trait describes **a person's tendency to be organized, disciplined, and achievement-oriented**. Highly conscientious individuals are typically reliable, thorough, and methodical in their approach to tasks. They value planning, order, and completing responsibilities. Those lower in conscientiousness may be more spontaneous, disorganized, and might prioritize flexibility over structure.

Extraversion
: This trait reflects **a person's preference for social interaction and external stimulation**. Extraverts tend to be energetic, talkative, and gain energy from being around others. They often seek excitement and are comfortable in group settings. Introverts (those low in extraversion) typically prefer quieter environments, deeper one-on-one interactions, and need time alone to recharge.

Agreeableness
: This trait describes **a person's tendency toward cooperation and social harmony**. Highly agreeable individuals are typically compassionate, considerate, and eager to help others. They value getting along with people and avoiding conflict. Those lower in agreeableness tend to be more competitive, skeptical, and willing to challenge others' views.

Neuroticism (sometimes referred to as Emotional Stability)
: This trait reflects **a person's tendency to experience negative emotions and psychological distress**. Individuals high in neuroticism may experience more anxiety, mood swings, irritability, and emotional reactivity. Those low in neuroticism (high in emotional stability) tend to be more calm, emotionally resilient, and less easily upset by stressors.

## Relation to leadership

![Regression of Leadership on Big Five Traits according to the meta study of @judge2002personality](images/leadershipBigFive.svg){#fig-bigFive fig-align="left"}

::: notes
**Leadership effectiveness** refers to a leader's performance in influencing and guiding the activities of his or her unit toward achievement of its goals [@stogdill1950leadership].

**Leadership emergence** refers to whether (or to what degree) an individual is viewed as a leader by others, who typically have only limited information about that individual's performance [@hogan1994we].

Leadership effectiveness and emergence represent two levels of analysis. Leadership emergence is a within-group phenomenon. In contrast, leadership effectiveness represents a between-groups phenomenon.

Regarding these two constructs and personality trais, the meta-analysis of @judge2002personality shows that:

- The Big Five typology is a fruitful basis for examining the dispositional predictors of leadership.
- **Extraversion** is the most important trait of leaders and effective leadership.
- Extraversion is more strongly related to leader emergence than to leader effectiveness.
- **Extraversion**, **Conscientiousness** and **Openness to Experience** were the strongest and most consistent correlates of leadership.
- Conscientiousness is more strongly related to leader emergence than to leadership effectiveness.
- **Agreeableness** was the least relevant trait.
- **Neuroticism** failed to emerge as a significant predictor of leadership.

Overall, the traits are better predictors in situations in which individuals have only limited opportunity to observe leadership behaviors (i.e., student samples). However, the results may simply indicate a close correspondence between the way we see people's personalities and our stereotypical conceptions of the characteristics of leaders.

## Evolution

We know which traits matter — but where do they come from?

:::large
Leaders are born.
:::

:::fragment
Really?
:::

:::fragment
Traits have a **genetic source** [and are the result of **adaptive processes** [[@judge2009bright].]{.smaller}]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::fragment
The statement, thus, **oversimplifies a complex phenomenon** that involves an interplay between genetic factors, developmental experiences, learning, and situational contexts.
:::

:::notes
Studies of identical twins separated at birth have indeed provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of personality traits, including those associated with leadership. Twin studies typically show heritability estimates of 30-60% for leadership tendencies, suggesting a significant genetic component.
However, the research doesn't support a purely deterministic "born leader" perspective for several reasons:

1. Even with identical twins raised apart, the heritability of leadership traits is never 100%. Environmental factors still play a substantial role.
2. Leadership comprises multiple traits and abilities (like extraversion, assertiveness, decision-making skill, emotional intelligence) that may each have different genetic influences.
3. The expression of genetic predispositions often depends on environmental triggers and opportunities (gene-environment interaction).
4. Leadership development research shows that many leadership skills can be learned and improved through experience, mentoring, and deliberate practice.
5. Cultural and situational factors heavily influence who emerges as a leader and what leadership styles are effective.

A more nuanced view supported by contemporary research is that certain individuals may have genetic predispositions that make leadership roles more natural or appealing to them, but these predispositions require the right environmental conditions, learning experiences, and opportunities to develop into effective leadership.

> "Asking how much a particular individual's attitudes or traits are due to heredity versus the environment is nonsensical, just like asking whether a leaky basement is caused more by the crack in the foundation or the water outside." @olson2001heritability [*pp. 845-846*]

![The Leader Trait Emergence Effectiveness (LTEE) model [@judge2009bright]](images/process.svg){#fig-process fig-align="left"}

The Leader Trait Emergence Effectiveness (LTEE) model combines the behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology theories of how personality traits are developed into a model that explains leader emergence and effectiveness [@judge2009bright].

- The **genetics** are the foundational biological basis for leadership potential. Genetic predispositions influence personality traits, cognitive abilities, emotional regulation as well as neurological characteristics that support leadership behaviors.
- **Selection processes** refer to the mechanisms by which potential leaders are identified and developed. While genes determine the expression of traits, evolutionary
processes, in organizations and in collectives more generally, determine which traits are "selected in" and "selected out."
- **Traits** are individual characteristics that contribute to leadership potential.
- **Mediators** are intervening factors that translate traits into leadership behaviors. Based on Socioanalytic Theory @judge2009bright argue that the reason traits result in leader emergence is because of the motives the traits elicit. For example,
  - conscientious, extraverted, and emotionally stable (or high core self-evaluations) individuals may be more motivated to get ahead (agency, competing)
  - extraverted and agreeable individuals may be more likely to go along (communion, cooperation),
  - and intelligent, and charismatic individuals may be more likely to provide meaning for their compatriots
- **Leader emergence** is the process of transitioning from potential to recognized leadership, which depends on the context and the adaptive processes. As adaptive and coordination problems increase, so does the importance of leadership. There is little need for prudent, courageous and flexible leadership when the collective faces little conflict from within or without. Thus, leader emergence occurs through recognition and opportunity.
- **Subjective effectiveness** reflects perceived leadership quality (e.g., peer receptions, follower satisfaction, reputation and social standing).
- **Objective effectiveness** demonstrates tangible leadership impact (e.g., team productivity, goal achievement, financial performance).

: Trait paradoxes as identified by @judge2009bright (more paradoxes in the paper) {#tbl-paradoxes}

# Emotional intelligence

Intelligence is the most "successful" trait in social and applied psychology [@judge2009bright].

:::fragment
@goleman1998makes argues that it is not IQ (intelligence, a trait), but **emotional intelligence** that sets apart great leaders.
:::

:::fragment
Emotional intelligence is a group of **five skills** that enable the best leaders to maximize their own and their followers' performance:
:::

::: incremental
-   **Self-awareness** — knowing one's strengths, weaknesses, drives, values, and impact on others.
-   **Self-regulation** — controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods.
-   **Motivation** — relishing achievements for its own sake.
-   **Empathy** — understanding other people's emotional makeup and treating them accordingly.
-   **Social skill** — building rapport with others to move them in desired directions.
:::

## Self-awareness

Self-awareness — the first component of emotional intelligence — is arguably the **foundation of all leadership development**.

:::fragment
:::medium
Leaders who understand their own strengths, weaknesses, values, and emotional patterns can better manage themselves, relate to others, and adapt to different situations.
:::
:::

:::notes
Research consistently shows that self-aware leaders are more effective. They make sounder decisions because they understand their own biases. They build stronger relationships because they can accurately read how their behavior affects others. And they develop faster because they know where to focus their growth efforts.

Self-awareness connects directly to what we discussed about mental models in [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd#mental-models) : just as the "map is not the territory," our self-image is not a perfect representation of who we actually are. 

Cognitive biases — particularly confirmation bias in self-perception — can distort our self-understanding. Seeking disconfirming evidence about ourselves is just as important as seeking it in our decision-making.
:::

# Conclusion {.discussion-slide}

:::large
It is fortunate, then, that emotional intelligence can be learned.\

Learning might mean here being able to deal efficiently with our personality traits that have a genetic source.
