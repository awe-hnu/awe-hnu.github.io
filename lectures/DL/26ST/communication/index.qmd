Form groups of 4–5. Each student **tells** their leadership story to the group in 60 seconds.

Then vote for the story you liked best.

**Storytelling circle — Phase 1: Telling (5 min).**

Emphasize: this is storytelling, not summarizing. Use first person, set the scene, create tension, land the message.
After all members have told their stories, the group votes: which story was most compelling?
The winner will represent the group in the plenary.

Walk around and coach: "Don't explain the story — *tell* it. Start with the moment, not the context."

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Each group coaches their elected storyteller: sharpen the opening, find the emotional peak, land the message crisply. This peer coaching moment builds metacognition about what makes stories work — the group must articulate *why* they chose this story and *how* to make it better. The coaching IS the learning.

## Plenary debrief {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What elements did the most compelling stories have in common?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
After each, the audience gives one-word reactions: "What did you feel?"

Collect the words on the board. After all performances, ask: "What patterns do you see in these words?"

Expected patterns: personal connection, emotional resonance, concrete details, clear message, authenticity.

Preview: "Today we'll understand *why* these elements work — and learn to use them deliberately. Storytelling is the skill that makes all other leadership skills communicable."

Connect: "Every concept we've studied — engaging leadership, psychological safety, coalition building — becomes more powerful when you can tell its story."

-   A great salesperson knows how to tell a story in which the product is the hero.
-   A successful line manager can rally the team to extraordinary efforts through a story that shows how short-term sacrifice leads to long-term success.

It was he who recorded the oral history of the tribe, encoding its beliefs, values, and rules in the tales of its great heroes, of its triumphs and tragedies. The life-or-death lessons necessary to perpetuate the community's survival were woven into these stories: "We don't go hunting in the Great Wood---not since that terrible day when three of our bravest were killed there by unknown beasts. Here's how it happened ..." [@guber2007four]

Great storytelling does not conflict with truth. In the business world and elsewhere, it is always built on the integrity of the story and its teller. [@guber2007four].
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Key insight from @guber2007four: storytelling has always been about instructing and leading. At the tribal fire, the storyteller encoded the community's beliefs, values, and survival lessons into tales. The same function exists in organizations today.

The critical point: storytelling is NOT manipulation. Effective leadership storytelling is built on authenticity and integrity — connecting to authentic leadership ([Unit 8](../context/index.qmd)).
:::
:::

## Truth found in an effective story

@guber2007four distilled four kinds of truth found in an effective story:

::: incremental
- **Truth to the teller:** what a storyteller says must be consistent in their heart and mind
- **Truth to the audience:** the storyteller has to understand and recognize what the audience wants and needs and address those wants and needs
- **Truth to the moment:** a storyteller adapts a story to the context in which the story is told
- **Truth to the mission:** a storyteller is "devoted to a cause beyond self."
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Adapting to the audience and moment demands **behavioral complexity** ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)).

**Truth to the audience** means *different truths for different stakeholders*. The story you tell investors is not the story you tell engineers — not because you are dishonest, but because their concerns, values, and decision criteria differ. Your stakeholder analysis ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)) tells you *who* you are speaking to; storytelling tells you *how*.

Consider the IAP2 engagement spectrum: when you are *informing* stakeholders, your story is factual and clear. When you are *consulting*, your story invites response. When you are *collaborating*, you co-create the narrative. The engagement level shapes the story structure.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each truth with examples:

- **Truth to the teller** connects to authentic leadership: if you don't believe your own story, no one else will.
- **Truth to the audience** connects to stakeholder analysis ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)): different audiences need different stories. The story you tell investors is not the story you tell engineers — not because you're dishonest, but because their concerns differ.
- **Truth to the moment** connects to behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): a story that inspires during a product launch may fall flat during a crisis.
- **Truth to the mission** connects to engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)): the *inspiring* behavior is about enthusing people about a vision beyond themselves.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## Truth to the audience {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
How does the audience change the story?
:::

Think about one message (e.g., "We need to invest in AI"):

1. How would you tell this to the **CEO**?
2. How would you tell this to the **engineering team**?
3. How would you tell this to **employees worried about their jobs**?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}
:::

------

**Truth to the moment** requires the [behavioral complexity](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd#behavioral-complexity):\
reading the situation and adjusting your approach accordingly.

:::fragment
:::medium
A story that inspires during a product launch may fall flat during a crisis. A narrative of ambition works when the team is energized; a narrative of resilience works when the team is exhausted. The adaptive leader reads the moment and adjusts.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (2 min).**

The four truths together form a complete framework: the teller must be authentic, the audience must be understood, the moment must be read, and the mission must transcend self-interest. When all four align, the story becomes a force multiplier for leadership.
:::
:::

# Structure {.headline-only}

## Layers of conviction

Aristotle argued that a good speech contains three types of persuasion

:::fragment
::: larger
Ethos, pathos, logos
:::
:::

::: incremental
-   **Logos** appeals to the audience's reason, building up logical arguments.
-   **Ethos** appeals to the status or authority so that listeners are more likely to trust the speaker.
-   **Pathos** appeals to the emotions, e.g., trying to make the audience feel angry or sympathetic.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
**Telling good stories includes:**

-   Thinking up in advance exactly what arguments can be made both for and against a given proposition, selecting the best on your own side, and finding counterarguments to those on the other.
-   You need to be clear about what your audience needs to know (or believe, which is the same thing in rhetoric) in order to understand that you are trustworthy, that you have the right to speak on the subject and that you are speaking in good faith. Your audience needs to believe that you are "a pretty honest guy".
-   Finding ways to drive your argument forward. This is the stuff of your arguments, the way one point proceeds to another, as if to show that the conclusion to which you are aiming is not only the right one, but so necessary and reasonable as to be more or less the only one.

Good read: [Ethos, Logos and Pathos: The Structure of a Great Speech](https://fs.blog/ethos-logos-pathos/#:~:text=Ethos%20is%20about%20establishing%20your,what%20the%20three%20look%20like.)
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Good storytelling includes all three — but the *balance* depends on the audience and moment:

- A board presentation is logos-heavy (data, projections) with ethos (your credibility) supporting it
- A team rally is pathos-heavy (shared purpose, emotional connection) with logos providing grounding
- A client pitch balances all three: ethos (why trust us), logos (how it works), pathos (imagine the impact)

Connect to IAP2: informing → logos-heavy. Collaborating → balanced. Empowering → pathos-heavy with ethos.
:::
:::

## Story structure

Behind really good stories is a well thought-out structure that forms the backbone of the story. This backbone, called the story elements, help writers develop great stories. The essential elements of a story are:

:::fragment
:::larger
[Characters]{.fragment}\
[Setup or conflict]{.fragment}\
[Sequence of events (plot)]{.fragment}\
[Resolution]{.fragment}
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Every effective leadership story has these elements, even when told briefly:
- **Character**: Who is the story about? (Often the audience themselves)
- **Conflict**: What challenge or tension drives the story forward?
- **Plot**: What happens? How does the tension build?
- **Resolution**: How is the conflict resolved? What's the takeaway?

Frame: "When you strip away the theory, every great leadership story is: 'Here was the challenge → here's what we did → here's what we learned/achieved.'"

Narrative maps consist of several important elements that make it easier to explain messages and give them clarity and context.

-   **Focus:** This is the central part of a narrative. It is comparable to a headline that explains and highlights the core of the story. Is the focus about innovation, change, competition or something else?
-   **Conflict or challenge:** What is the challenge, conflict or problem in the market that your company is dealing with? Why does this problem exist? Who is contributing to it? This begins to isolate the main problem within the story.
-   **Opportunity:** What is the impact or opportunity for your organisation? This is what some people call an unmet need or an aha moment. This is something you can use to bring about change or to address and solve a problem.
-   **Approach:** How does your story unfold? What are the three or four characters or key elements? What is the how, where and when?
-   **Resolution:** All good stories have an ending or conclusion. How do you resolve the build-up from the beginning? Let's say your story is about innovation and there are four ways the company will create something new. What is the benefit to a customer, an employee, the industry or the community? Where does this story end? Who sees the benefits?

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

Walk through the narrative map structure:

- **Focus**: The central theme — what is this story fundamentally about?
- **Conflict/challenge**: What is the problem? Why does it matter?
- **Opportunity**: The "aha moment" — what insight or possibility changes the game?
- **Approach**: How does the story unfold? What are the key elements?
- **Resolution**: How does it end? Who benefits?

**Video + debrief (7 min: 5 min video, 2 min debrief).**

After watching, ask: "What are the four truths in this story? Where are the story elements? Where does ethos, pathos, logos appear?"

Expected: Truth to the teller (deeply personal), truth to the audience (universal human themes), truth to the moment (TED talk format), truth to the mission (living fully). Heavy on pathos, with logos emerging from the specific experience.

## The edding marker pitch {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Create and perform a story.
:::

Imagine you work as an internal consultant at *edding* and you have developed a first-class innovation: a whiteboard marker that always works (built-in sensor that tells you when it is dry, a canister that makes recycling easier).

You have the opportunity to pitch the idea to the CEO and the board. You want to convince them to take a leap of faith.

Form teams of max. 2 students. Write your story using the narrative map structure. Be ready to perform it.

{{< countdown "15:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Pitch tournament with peer scoring (20 min total: 12 min writing, 8 min tournament).**

Writing phase (12 min): Same as before — pairs write their pitch using the narrative map. Walk around coaching: "What's your conflict? Where's the pathos? How does your resolution connect to the company's mission?"

Tournament phase (8 min): Each pair performs (90 sec max, strictly timed). After each pitch, the audience scores on a simple rubric (hand signals 1–5):
- **Truth to the teller**: Did you believe them? (1–5 fingers)
- **Story structure**: Was there a clear conflict → opportunity → resolution? (1–5 fingers)
- **Emotional impact**: Did you *feel* something? (1–5 fingers)

The scoring creates metacognition: students must evaluate storytelling quality in real time, which deepens their understanding of the framework. Announce the highest-scoring pitch at the end — celebrate it briefly.

# Storytelling for different stakeholder audiences {.headline-only}

## Adapting your story

The IAP2 engagement spectrum ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)) maps directly to communication strategies:

:::fragment
| Engagement level | Communication approach | Story emphasis |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Inform** | Clear, factual narrative | Logos-heavy — data, evidence, transparency |
| **Consult** | Story that invites response | Balanced — present the situation, ask for input |
| **Involve** | Narrative that creates ownership | Pathos + ethos — "This is *our* challenge" |
| **Collaborate** | Co-created story | Shared narrative — "Let's write this story together" |
| **Empower** | Story that transfers agency | "This is *your* story to tell" |
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Different stakeholders require fundamentally different narratives — not because the leader is being manipulative, but because effective communication means meeting people where they are. A board of directors needs a strategic narrative grounded in data and financial projections (logos). A demoralized team needs an inspirational narrative of resilience and shared purpose (pathos + ethos). A key partner needs a collaborative narrative of mutual benefit.

This connects truth to the audience (Guber) with stakeholder analysis ([Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd)): your stakeholder map tells you *who* your audiences are, and storytelling theory tells you *how* to reach each one effectively.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## Audience adaptation {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Same story, three audiences — live.
:::

Return to the edding marker pitch. Imagine you will pitch to **different stakeholders**:

1. **The CEO and board** — market potential, competitive advantage, financial returns
2. **The engineering team** — technical feasibility, innovation challenge, professional pride
3. **End customers (facility managers)** — reliability, cost savings, sustainability

What changes across versions? What stays the same?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Plenary (4 min): "Which truth stayed constant? Which shifted?"

Expected insight: *truth to the teller* and *truth to the mission* stay constant. Only *truth to the audience* and *truth to the moment* change. This is ethical adaptability, not manipulation.

# Storytelling as mental model {.headline-only}

-----

:::medium
Storytelling is itself a mental model — perhaps the most fundamental one for leaders.
:::

:::fragment
It is how we make sense of complexity, communicate vision, and move people to action. Every model in your latticework becomes more powerful when you can *tell its story* — explain it clearly, connect it to lived experience, and inspire others to apply it.
:::

:::fragment
Your latticework is now complete — for now. Remember Parrish's counsel: **learn, apply, reflect**. This is a lifelong project. The compound interest of mental models accumulates over decades.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (2 min).**

Frame storytelling as the meta-skill: it amplifies every other skill. A leader who understands psychological safety but can't communicate it will struggle to build it. A leader who understands stakeholder dynamics but can't tell a compelling narrative will fail to build coalitions.

The real learning begins when students apply these models in practice. Encourage them to keep building: read widely, reflect deliberately, and connect new ideas to what they already know.
