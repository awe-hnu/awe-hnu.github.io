:::notes
The session is designed as a flipped classroom — students have pre-read @lavine2014paradoxical and answered four guiding questions about ambidexterity, behavioral complexity, CVF paradoxes, and their digital-era relevance.

- The activation uses a **snowball discussion** (1-2-4-plenary) to surface pre-reading insights with progressively larger groups.
- The paradoxes block uses a **fishbowl** format — one group in the center discusses while others observe and then rotate.
- The adaptive leadership block uses a **devil's advocate** format — students argue opposing positions.
- The integration exercise uses **role-play** — groups represent different organizational roles.

## Opening remarks

:::medium
> The hallmark of a first-class leader is the ability to demonstrate contrary or opposing behaviors while maintaining a certain level of integrity, credibility and direction. *@denison1995paradox*
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Great leaders can adapt their approach based on what the situation requires. For example, they might need to:

- Be decisive yet open to input
- Maintain stability while driving change
- Show empathy while making tough decisions
- Focus on details without losing sight of the big picture

These behaviors are complementary skills that effective leaders can deploy at the right moments. The challenge is displaying these different behaviors while still being perceived as authentic and consistent in your core values and direction.

This flexibility allows leaders to respond appropriately to complex, changing environments rather than being rigid in their approach. It's not about being inconsistent or unpredictable, but rather having a diverse repertoire of leadership behaviors to draw upon while maintaining a coherent leadership identity.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Great leaders don't just pick a side when facing competing demands. They hold both sides simultaneously. This sounds abstract — but it is deeply practical. Today we will build three frameworks for understanding and navigating this reality.

# Paradoxes in leadership {.headline-only}

## Opening remarks

::: medium
> Leadership requires the capacity to [recognize]{.link-color} and [react]{.link-color} to paradox, contradiction, and complexity. *@denison1995paradox*
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Traditional management theories have often presented organizational phenomena in terms of **discrete, opposing categories** (e.g., Theory X and Theory Y, transactional and transformational leadership). In contrast, more recent theorizing has placed greater emphasis on paradox[^1], contradiction, and complexity, suggesting that many phenomena may in fact fit **multiple opposing categories simultaneously**.

While not denying the underlying discrete categories, this more complex perspective recognizes that organizations face competing demands that appear contradictory but must be managed simultaneously. These tensions create the paradoxes that leaders must navigate. Effective leaders are those who have the cognitive and behavioral **capacity to recognize and react to paradox, contradiction, and complexity in their environments** [@denison1995paradox]. Particularly when considering that **paradox is fundamental to contemporary work contexts** characterized by globalization, technological change, and increased competition [@lavine2014paradoxical].
:::

[^1]: A paradox can be defined as a set of mutually inconsistent propositions, each of which seems true [@rescher2004paradoxes].

## What is a paradox? {.discussion-slide}

What is a contradiction,\
what a paradox?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Let students share their intuitive understanding before introducing the formal definitions. Many conflate the two. The key distinction: contradictions are either/or; paradoxes are both/and tensions that persist over time and resist simple resolution.

Collect answers on the board in two columns. Then reveal the formal definitions on the next slide.
:::
:::
:::

## Paradox

**Contradiction** refers to bipolar opposites that are mutually exclusive and interdependent such that the opposites define and potentially negate each other [@putnam2016contradictions, p 6].

:::fragment
:::small
*Example:* A supervisor manages a remote team by strictly enforcing a '9-to-5' login policy. If an employee attends a child's school play, they are physically and legally 'not at work.' Here, work and family are treated as **mutually exclusive blocks of time**; the presence of one necessitates the absence of the other.
:::
:::

:::fragment
**Paradox** refers to contradictions that persist over time, impose and reflect back on each other, and develop into seemingly irrational or absurd situations because
their continuity creates situations in which options appear mutually exclusive, making choices among them difficult [@putnam2016contradictions, p 8].
:::

:::fragment
:::small
*Example:* An organization implements 'Unlimited Paid Time Off' to give employees total autonomy. However, because employees want to prove they are worthy of such trust, they feel pressured to work harder and take less leave than before. The very policy designed to provide freedom (autonomy) ends up tightening the 'invisible' leash of self-surveillance (control). This is paradoxical because the **increase in freedom directly causes an increase in constraint**, creating an absurd cycle that persists regardless of how many 'days off' are offered.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Paradoxes differ from contradictions (i.e., logic: if you are doing A, you cannot be doing B) in that they create situations of almost impossible choice (i.e., logic: doing A leads to more of B), hence the seeming irrationality or absurdity of the situation.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Walk through each definition with its example. Emphasize the temporal dimension: contradictions can be resolved by choosing one side; paradoxes persist because choosing one side intensifies the other.

Ask: "Can you think of a paradox from your own work or study experience?" Take 1–2 quick examples. This bridges to ambidexterity.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## Ambidexterity {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What is ambidexterity,\
what is behavioral complexity?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Students encountered both concepts in @lavine2014paradoxical. Let them articulate their understanding before you formalize it. This is a payoff moment for those who did the reading.

If the room is quiet, prompt: "The reading used the phrase 'organizational ambidexterity' — what did it mean?"
:::
:::
:::

## Ambidexterity

::: medium
> Ambidexterity refers to "an organization's capacity to address two organizationally incompatible objectives equally well." *@birkinshaw2013clarifying [p. 291]*
:::

:::fragment
The ability of senior leadership teams to embrace tension between old states and activities and new ones is a key predictor of firm success [@tushman2011ambidextrous].
:::

::: fragment
::: medium
> Leaders must "embrace inconsistency by maintaining multiple and often conflicting strategic demands." *@o2011organizational [p. 76]*
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Ambidexterity is the organizational-level concept. The classic example is exploiting existing business while exploring new opportunities — efficiency vs. innovation. Make sure students see that this is a *paradox* by the definition we just established.

Transition: "Ambidexterity describes what *organizations* must do. But what does it take from the *leader*? That's behavioral complexity."
:::
:::

## Behavioral complexity

::: large
> It takes complexity to defeat complexity. *@uhl2007complexity [p. 301]*
:::

:::fragment
Increasing social and organizational complexity requires **cognitive complexity** and **behavioral complexity** --- "we must conceive and perform" [@denison1995paradox, p. 524].
:::

:::fragment
Effective leaders are those who have the cognitive as well as the behavioral capacity to **recognize** and **react** to paradox, contradiction, and complexity in their environments [@denison1995paradox; @lawrence2009behavioral; @spreitzer1996empowering].
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Key points:

1. Cognitive complexity = the ability to *see* multiple competing demands simultaneously.
2. Behavioral complexity = the ability to *act* on multiple competing demands — to shift between seemingly contradictory behaviors.
3. This is not being inconsistent or unpredictable. It is a *repertoire* of leadership behaviors deployed intentionally.

Connect to [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd): "Remember the trait paradoxes? Behavioral complexity is the capacity to hold those paradoxes rather than resolving them."
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: medium
Effective leadership is dependent on **behavioral complexity**, "the ability to perform the multiple roles and behaviors that circumscribe the requisite variety implied by an organizational or environmental context". [[@denison1995paradox, p. 526]]{.smaller}
:::

:::fragment
This capacity to act flexibly across competing demands is exactly what adaptive leadership theory formalizes.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## Paradoxes in practice {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think of a leader you have observed (boss, coach, teacher, project lead).
:::

1. Identify a **paradox** they faced — two contradictory demands at the same time.
2. How did they handle it — did they **choose a side**, **oscillate**, or **hold both**?
3. Would you describe their approach as showing **behavioral complexity**?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Fishbowl discussion (12 min total).**

Set up a fishbowl: 4–5 volunteers sit in a central circle; everyone else observes from the outer ring. The inner circle discusses the three questions for 6 minutes. One empty chair — any outer-ring student can sit down to contribute, and someone in the inner ring must leave.

After 6 minutes, debrief with the outer ring (4 min): "What patterns did you observe? What did you notice about how the inner group navigated the paradox of discussing paradox?" Push on:
- "Were the examples they gave true paradoxes or mere contradictions?"
- "Did the inner group itself exhibit behavioral complexity?"

Build the pattern: leaders who oscillate between extremes are perceived as inconsistent; leaders who hold both sides simultaneously are perceived as complex but authentic.

Transition: "The CVF gives us a structured way to map these competing demands."

![The competing values framework based on @quinn1988beyond](images/complexities.svg){#fig-complexities}

The competing values framework (CVF) [@quinn1988beyond] is a theoretical model that identifies four different management models that exist in tension with each other in organizations. The framework is built around two key dimensions. One dimension represents the continuum between flexibility or adaptability and stability or control. The other describes the continuum between efficient internal processes, such as human resource practices or internal control systems, and external positioning vis-à-vis stakeholders such as competitors, customers and clients. These dimensions create four quadrants, each representing a different model of organizational effectiveness:


[**Human Relations Model** (Clan Culture)]{.h4}

  - Key assumption: Human development and participation produce effectiveness
  - Characteristics: Family-like, collaborative, team-oriented
  - Leadership style: Mentoring, facilitating, nurturing
  - Value drivers: Commitment, communication, development

[**Open Systems Model** (Adhocracy Culture)]{.h4}

  - Key assumption: Innovation, vision, and constant change produce effectiveness
  - Characteristics: Dynamic, entrepreneurial, creative
  - Leadership style: Innovative, visionary, risk-oriented
  - Value drivers: Innovative outputs, transformation, agility

[**Internal Process Model** (Hierarchy Culture)]{.h4}

- Key assumption: Control and efficiency with appropriate processes produce effectiveness
- Characteristics: Structured, controlled, process-oriented
- Leadership style: Coordinating, organizing, efficiency-minded
- Value drivers: Efficiency, timeliness, consistency, uniformity

[**Rational Goal Model** (Market Culture)]{.h4}

- Key assumption: Aggressively competing and customer focus produce effectiveness
- Characteristics: Results-oriented, competitive, achievement-focused
- Leadership style: Hard-driving, directive, goal-oriented
- Value drivers: Market share, goal achievement, profitability

The key insight of the CVF is that the different model of organizational effectiveness contain inherent tensions or paradoxes (hence "competing values"). Effective management requires balancing these competing demands rather than focusing exclusively on one approach. The framework suggests that successful managers develop competencies across all four quadrants and can flexibly apply different approaches depending on the situation.

The four orientations are intuitively appealing, perhaps confirming their origin in psychological archetypes; most people can probably find the culture of their current organisation somewhere in this taxonomy. However, as the academic labels for them in each quadrant are often misunderstood, it has proven useful to substitute more accessible and commonly used verbs to describe the dominant activities that relate to each culture---*collaborate*, *create*, *compete*, and *control* [@lavine2014paradoxical].
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Walk through each layer:

1. **Two dimensions**: flexibility vs. stability (vertical), internal vs. external (horizontal).
2. **Clan/Collaborate**: human development and participation produce effectiveness. Family-like, collaborative, team-oriented.
3. **Adhocracy/Create**: innovation, vision, and constant change produce effectiveness. Dynamic, entrepreneurial.
4. **Hierarchy/Control**: control and efficiency with appropriate processes produce effectiveness. Structured, process-oriented.
5. **Market/Compete**: aggressively competing and customer focus produce effectiveness. Results-oriented.
6. **Full framework**: all four are needed simultaneously, and they are inherently in tension.

Emphasize that the verbs *collaborate*, *create*, *compete*, and *control* are more accessible than the academic labels.

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Reveal each quadrant's leadership description one at a time. After all four are visible, ask: "Which quadrant feels most natural to you?" (rhetorical — they will explore this in the exercise).

Key point: most leaders have a natural home quadrant. Behavioral complexity means operating effectively in *all four*, even the uncomfortable ones.
:::
:::

## Implications

Leadership qualities seem to be best demonstrated by **more movement throughout the framework**, suggesting complex adaptation to changing circumstances [@denison1995paradox].

:::fragment
> Complex situations require complex responses. Sometimes organizations benefit from stability, and sometimes they benefit from change. Often organizations need both stability and change at the same time. In contrast to earlier approaches, the development of the competing values framework did not assume that stability and change were mutually exclusive, an either/or decision. *@quinn2020becoming [p. 12]*
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The CVF provides a description of roles and behaviors to encourage self-reflection and to provide a preliminary sense of behaviors and accompanying roles that can be *learned*. Working to **overcome areas of relative weakness** so that they can be **transformed into average or adequate performance** can help leaders see more opportunities for action when core areas of strength are not delivering the desired results.

:::

Form grops of 3-4. Choose an organization you know well (workplace, university, sports club, startup) and:

1. **Identify** which CVF quadrant dominates.
2. **Assess** which quadrant is weakest or most neglected.
3. **Describe** a leadership challenge that arises from this imbalance.
4. **Propose** what a behaviorally complex leader would do differently.

**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min group work, 5 min plenary).**

Walk around and push for specificity:

- "Which quadrant dominates? Give a concrete example."
- "What is the cost of neglecting the weak quadrant?"
- "What would a behaviorally complex response look like in practice?"

In plenary, have 2–3 groups share. Build the pattern: imbalances create predictable pathologies (e.g., too much *control* stifles innovation; too much *create* leads to chaos).

## Situational leadership

The Situational Leadership model [@hersey1977management] proposes that leaders should adapt their style based on the **readiness level** of their followers — their ability and willingness to perform a specific task.

[Task behavior ("directive" dimension)]{.h4}

**Focus:** The technical execution of the job.

Task behavior is the extent to which a leader spells out the duties and responsibilities of an individual or group. It is goal-oriented and one-way communication.

- Key actions: Telling people what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who is to do it.
- High task: Necessary when the follower lacks the specific skills or experience to perform the task (Low Ability). The leader provides the "roadmap."
- Low task: Appropriate when the follower is competent and knows the process; the leader steps back to avoid micromanaging.

[Relationship behavior ("supportive" dimension)]{.h4}

**Focus:** The emotional and interpersonal connection.

Relationship behavior is the extent to which a leader engages in two-way communication. it is about providing emotional support, "psychological" encouragement, and facilitating involvement.

- Key actions: Listening, encouraging, collaborating, praising, and involving the follower in decision-making.
- High relationship: Used when the follower needs a boost in confidence or "buy-in" (Low Willingness/Confidence). The leader acts as a coach or cheerleader.
- Low relationship: Appropriate at both extremes of readiness. In "Telling," there isn't time for it; in "Delegating," the follower is so self-reliant they don't need constant social reinforcement.


Situational leadership serves as a bridge model between contingency thinking (Unit 2's evolution of leadership thought) and the more complex adaptive leadership framework. Its core insight is simple but powerful: there is no single best leadership style. The most effective approach depends on the development level of the people you are leading — and this can vary across tasks, projects, and time.

The model has practical value for everyday leadership decisions: a new team member learning a technical skill needs more direction (S1/S2), while an experienced professional tackling a familiar challenge benefits from autonomy (S3/S4). The leader's job is to diagnose readiness accurately and adjust accordingly.

However, situational leadership assumes that the *problem itself* is well-defined and the *solution* is known — the leader just needs to guide followers appropriately. What happens when the problem itself is unclear and no known solution exists? This is where adaptive leadership enters.

## Adaptive leadership

@heifetz1994leadership distinguishes between two fundamentally different types of challenges leaders face, which require different behaviors:

::::columns
:::{.column width="48%"}
**Technical problems**

- Problem definition is clear
- Solution is known
- Expert knowledge can solve it
- Implementation through authority

:::fragment
*Example: A hospital needs to upgrade its IT system — the requirements are known, vendors can be evaluated, and the project can be managed.*
:::
:::

:::{.column width="48%"}
**Adaptive challenges**

- Problem definition is unclear
- No known solution exists
- Requires learning and changed behavior
- Implementation through engagement

:::fragment
*Example: A hospital needs to fundamentally change its culture to reduce medical errors — this requires changed beliefs, behaviors, and relationships at every level.*
:::
:::
::::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The distinction between technical problems and adaptive challenges is one of the most powerful diagnostic tools in leadership theory. The most common leadership failure, @heifetz1994leadership argues, is treating adaptive challenges as if they were technical problems — applying expert solutions to situations that actually require people to learn new ways of operating.

Digital transformation is the quintessential adaptive challenge: it is not primarily a technology problem (technical) but a problem of changed behaviors, processes, mental models, and organizational culture (adaptive). Leaders who approach DT as a technology implementation project often fail because they underestimate the adaptive dimension.

:::notes
So how do leaders actually lead through adaptive challenges? Heifetz identifies four key practices.
:::
:::
:::

## Adaptive leadership practices

@heifetz2002leadership identify four key practices for leading through adaptive challenges:

:::incremental
1. **Getting on the balcony** — Step back from the action to observe patterns, political dynamics, and systemic issues. Leaders who are only "on the dance floor" cannot see the larger picture.
2. **Regulating distress** — Adaptive work generates discomfort because it challenges existing beliefs and competencies. Leaders must create enough disequilibrium to motivate change, but not so much that people become overwhelmed.
3. **Giving the work back** — The leader cannot solve adaptive challenges alone. The people with the problem must do the work of adapting. The leader's role is to create the conditions for this learning.
4. **Protecting voices of leadership from below** — People closest to the problem often have critical insights, but their views may be suppressed. Adaptive leaders protect and amplify dissenting voices.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
These practices require a fundamentally different orientation than traditional leadership. Rather than providing answers, the adaptive leader asks questions. Rather than reducing discomfort, they manage it productively. Rather than maintaining control, they distribute responsibility.

Notice how adaptive leadership connects back to the CVF: navigating adaptive challenges requires movement across all four quadrants. Sometimes you need to *control* (establish a holding environment), sometimes to *collaborate* (facilitate group learning), sometimes to *create* (experiment with new approaches), and sometimes to *compete* (make tough trade-off decisions). Adaptive challenges, by their nature, demand behavioral complexity.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
For each practice, give a brief concrete example:

1. **Balcony**: A project manager who pauses a heated meeting to ask "What pattern are we repeating here?"
2. **Regulating distress**: Announcing a restructuring (creates disequilibrium) while simultaneously providing a clear timeline and support (contains distress).
3. **Giving work back**: Instead of deciding how to implement a new process, the leader facilitates a workshop where the team designs it themselves.
4. **Protecting voices**: A senior leader publicly supports an intern's dissenting view in a meeting.

These practices require a fundamentally different orientation. Rather than providing answers, the adaptive leader asks questions.
:::
:::

## Behavioral complexity

:::medium
Adaptive challenges require behavioral complexity — the movement across all four CVF quadrants:
:::

:::incremental
- **Collaborate** — facilitate group learning and create psychological safety for experimentation
- **Create** — experiment with novel approaches and tolerate productive failure
- **Compete** — make difficult trade-off decisions when resources are scarce
- **Control** — establish structures that provide enough stability for people to take risks
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The connection between the CVF and adaptive leadership illustrates why behavioral complexity is so essential. Adaptive challenges are inherently paradoxical — they require simultaneous stability and change, direction and empowerment, urgency and patience. A leader who can only operate in one CVF quadrant will struggle with the contradictory demands of adaptive work.

This also connects to our latticework from [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd#the-latticework-approach): the CVF and adaptive leadership are both mental models that help leaders *diagnose* what type of challenge they face and *select* appropriate responses. The more models you have, the more nuanced your diagnosis and the more flexible your response repertoire.

Analyze a leadership challenge\
using all three frameworks.
:::

**Scenario**: A mid-sized company is implementing AI-driven customer service, replacing 30% of human agents. The remaining team is anxious, the technology is unproven, and customer satisfaction is dropping.

1. **CVF**: Which quadrants are in tension?
2. **Situational**: What do different stakeholders need (e.g., transformation lead, CEO, anxious customer-service agent, customer representative)?
3. **Adaptive**: Technical problem, adaptive challenge, or both?
4. **Synthesis**: What would a behaviorally complex leader do?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes

- CVF: The leader needs to *control* (manage the rollout), *create* (experiment with new models), *collaborate* (support the anxious team), and *compete* (maintain customer satisfaction).
- Situational: Remaining agents are high-ability but low-willingness (anxious) — needs Participating (S3).
- Adaptive: Technology implementation is technical; the cultural shift is adaptive.

Experiencing the competing demands is more powerful than analyzing them on paper.

# Leading innovation {.headline-only}

## Opening remarks

:::medium
> Leading innovation takes a distinctive kind of leadership, one that unleashes and harnesses the ["collective genius"]{.highlight} of the people in the organization. *Linda A. Hill*
:::

## Innovation

What is an innovation?

:::medium
An innovation can be defined as an idea, practice, or material artifact perceived to be **new** by the relevant unit of adoption and offers **worthwhile benefits** [@dewar1986adoption].
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

Innovations can be differentiated according to **the degree of deviation** from existing technologies and practices: incremental innovation and radical innovation [@mcdermott2002managing].

- **Radical innovations** are fundamental changes that represent revolutionary changes in technology [@dewar1986adoption]. They represent clear departures from existing practices and require new skills, levels of market understanding, leaps in new processing abilities, and systems throughout the organization [@mcdermott2002managing].
- **Incremental innovations** are minor improvements or simple adjustments in current technology.

The main difference that characterizes the two dipoles is the **degree of new knowledge** contained in the innovation [@dewar1986adoption], which implies **technological uncertainty**, **technical inexperience**, **business inexperience**, and **technology cost**.

:::

## Nature of innovating

:::large
Innovating is not about some genius having an **aha moment.**\
:::

:::fragment
**Innovating is a team sport** — combining individual's member's separate slices of genius into a single work of collective genius. Innovation requires a place where people are willing and able to do the hard work that innovative problem solving requires [@hill2014collective].
:::


## Significance

Competitiveness depends to a large extent on the ability to innovate. So the ongoing challenge is to build an organisation that is able to innovate all the time.

:::fragment
:::medium
> The rhetoric of innovation is often about fun and creativity, but the reality is that innovation can be very taxing and uncomfortable, both emotionally and intellectually. @hill2014collective [*p. 5*]
:::
:::

:::fragment
This requires leadership—a different kind of leadership?
:::

## Leadership

:::medium
The role of a leader of innovation is to create a community that is willing and able to generate new ideas. [@hill2014collective, p. 4]
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
@hill2014collective has done in-depth research on many exceptional innovation leaders in different organisations and at different levels (e.g. Pixar, VW, Pentagram, Google, Pfizer, IBM). They asked what role the leader plays in creating a more innovative organisation. They concluded that *directive leadership* can work well when the solution to a problem is known and clear. But when the problem requires a truly original answer, no one can decide in advance what that answer should be. Therefore, *leading innovation* cannot be about creating a vision, persuading people and then somehow inspiring them to implement it.
:::

:::fragment
So the question is not *"how do I make innovation happen?"*\
but rather, *"how do I set the stage for it to happen?"*
:::

## Paradoxes of innovation

The paradox at the heart of innovation is the need to **unleash** the talents of individuals and to **harness** those talents in the form of collective innovation [@hill2014collectiveB].

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
@hill2014collective identified six innovation paradoxes. The challenge for leaders is to help the organization continually re-calibrate between:

-   affirming the individual *... and* the group
-   supporting *... and* confronting (i.e., collaborative disagreement)
-   fostering experimentation and learning *... and* performance
-   promoting improvisation *... and* structure
-   showing patience *... and* urgency
-   encouraging bottom-up initiative *... and* intervening top-down

Leaders who stay on the right side of this paradox will never be able to unleash the full genius of their staff; they will have few or no ideas to use. Those who stay on the left side will have many ideas and possibilities to work with, but they will not be able to turn them into new and useful solutions; instead, conflict and chaos will reign. The correct position at any given time will depend on the circumstances. However, the goal will always be to take the position that enables the collaboration, experimentation and integration that are necessary for innovation.

![Paradoxes of innovation according to @hill2014collective](images/paradoxes.svg){#fig-paradoxes}
:::

## Hard work of innovation

The role of an innovation leader is to create a community that is **willing** and **able** to innovate over time [@hill2014collective].

::: columns
::: column
![Willingness to innovate](images/willingness.svg){#fig-willingness}
:::

::: column
![Ability to innovate](images/ability.svg){#fig-ability}
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

To build **willingness**, leaders must nurture a sense of community, which rests on three elements---a sense of *purpose*, *values*, and *rules of engagement* [@hill2014collective].

Purpose
:   Purpose is not what a group does but who is in it or why it exists. It is about a collective identity.

Shared values
:   To form a community, members have to agree on what is important. By shaping the group's priorities and choices, values influence individual and collective thought and action (e.g., bold ambition, collaboration, responsibility, learning)

Rules of engagement
:   Those keep members focused on what is imperative, discourage unproductive behaviors, and encourage activities that foster innovation (e.g., respect, trust, influence, see the whole, question everything, be data driven.

The **ability** to innovate, is dependent on the leader creating *creative abrasion*, *creative resolution*, and *creative agility* [@hill2014collective].

Creative abrasion
:   The ability to develop a marketplace where rich diverse ideas compete through discourse and debate.

Creative agility
:   The ability to develop and test different options, learn from outcomes and try again and again till the optimal option is evolved.

Creative resolution
:   The ability to make decisions that combine disparate and sometimes even opposing ideas.

:::

## Creative abrasion

Technology challenges art.
:::

> Part of the magic of Pixar is that these **two disciplines bump up against each other** and create something better than either could create by itself. *Greg Brandeau, Pixar Animation Studios*

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
**Paradoxes**

-   Individual vs. group identity
-   Support vs. confrontation

**Ingredients**

-   Diversity (i.e., people who think differently)
-   Cognitive conflict over ideas and approaches (i.e., aimed at learning and improving not winning/losing/dominating) --- doing experiments

**Leader's role**

-   Espouse, encourage, expect and practice communal norms that value and even amplified diversity.
-   Push people together and create situation in which diverse thinkers where put in close proximity
-   Create organizational bridges
:::

## Creative agility

:::medium
Pursue. Reject. Adjust.
:::

> We used to launch products in an "all or nothing" mode to all of our users. Now we had the capability to test multiple different live versions of new products on 1 percent samples of our users. This yielded huge data sets and brought with it a change in mind-set for approaching innovation. We began to avoid projects that only allowed for "zero or one" decisions, instead choosing projects that could be rolled out and **evaluated in small slices**. *Philipp Justus, eBay Germany*

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Creative agility is about **discovery based learning**. It involves quickly pursuing multiple experiments, learning from the outcomes, and then adjusting plans. @hill2014collective[*p. 9*]

**Paradoxes**

-   Learning and development vs. performance
-   Improvisation vs. structure

**Ingredients**

-   Nimble mind

**Leader's role**

-   Pursue new ideas vigorously, proactively again and again
-   Reflect to harvest knowledge (consciously, collaboratively and openly)
-   Adjust and identify next steps in seeking a solution

Creative agility requires a community. Common purpose and shared values provide a framework for creating and assessing experiments.
:::

## Creative resolution

:::medium
From *either or*\
to *both-and* thinking
:::

> We hired innovators and if I were to forbid a passionate team to do something, it really would have misused their talents. I wanted people with a vision, and the ambition to build the next great thing. We needed to let teams go far enough so they could in fact discover this great new thing. Or, in another scenario, they had to recognize it was not quite right, then decide to work on something else, in the best-case scenario **integrating their knowledge to another solution**. *Bill Coughran, Google*

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
**Paradoxes**

-   Patience vs. urgency
-   Bottom-up vs. top-down initiatives

**Ingredients**

-   "Either-or" to "Both-and" thinking

**Leader's role**

-   Guide their organizations to keep multiple options open
-   Create the space for integration by keeping things simple, flexible and open
-   Lead differently by aggregating view points not directing decisions
:::

## Innovation leaders

The leaders @hill2014collectiveB studied had some things in common — they call it **the right stuff**

:::fragment
They are found to be:
:::

:::incremental
-   idealist, yet pragmatists;
-   integrative thinkers, yet action oriented;
-   generous, yet demanding[^3]; and
-   human, yet highly resilient[^4]
:::

[^3]: Generosity here means the willingness, based on their own sense of personal security, to share power, control **and** credit

[^4]: This includes the willingness to admit imperfections and asking for help

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Self-check

Are you an innovation leader? Start by asking yourself these questions about your organization [@hill2014collective, p. 10]:

-   Do members of my organization feel part of a community?
-   Does my organization have a shared purpose---one that binds us together and compels us all to do the hard work of innovation?
-   Does it live by rules of engagement supportive of a set of core values: bold ambition, responsibility to the community, collaboration, and learning?
-   Do we have the ability to generate ideas through candid discourse and debate?
-   Do we have the ability to test ideas through quick pursuit, reflection, and adaptation?
-   Do we have the ability to make integrative decisions, rather than compromising or letting some groups dominate?

Ask yourself some questions about your own leadership mind-set and practices: - Do I think my primary job as a leader is to create a context in which my team can innovate? - Am I comfortable serving as the "stage setter" as opposed to the visionary leading from the front? - Do I have the courage and patience required to amplify differences, even when discussion becomes heated and when ambiguity and complexity loom?

If your answer to any of these questions is "no" or even "I don't know," it's probably time to look again at your own leadership role and at the leadership potential that may be hiding in your organization.
