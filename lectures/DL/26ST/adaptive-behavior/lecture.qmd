:::notes
The session is designed as a flipped classroom — students have pre-read @lavine2014paradoxical and answered four guiding questions about ambidexterity, behavioral complexity, CVF paradoxes, and their digital-era relevance.

- Front-load the pre-reading payoff in Block 1 so students immediately see value in having prepared.
- The CVF exercise in Block 2 is the most substantial group task — allocate time generously.
- Keep the adaptive leadership mini-lecture tight; the Think-Pair-Share does the deep work.
:::

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. **Distinguish** paradox from contradiction and explain why paradox is fundamental to contemporary organizations.
2. **Explain** the Competing Values Framework as a diagnostic tool for leadership tensions.
3. **Differentiate** technical problems from adaptive challenges using Heifetz's framework.
4. **Apply** the concept of behavioral complexity to analyse leadership situations.
:::

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Latticework check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Which mental models from [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd) and [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd) might help us think about paradox?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Plenary warm-up (5 min).**

Let 2–3 students respond briefly. Expected connections:

- **Inversion** — what would happen if a leader were completely inflexible?
- **Both/and thinking** — what if opposing demands are not a choice but a creative tension?
- **Trait paradoxes** from Unit 2 — every strength has a shadow
- **Map vs. territory** — our frameworks simplify complex reality

Land on: today we formalize the idea that paradox is not a flaw to be resolved but a condition to be navigated.
:::

## Individual reflection {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Write down your findings.
:::

1. **One insight** from @lavine2014paradoxical that **confirmed** something you expected.
2. **One finding** that **surprised** you.

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Individual writing (4 min).**

This activates the pre-reading and gives you a quick diagnostic of engagement. Students who did the reading will be able to articulate specific concepts (ambidexterity, CVF quadrants, behavioral complexity). Students who didn't will struggle — note this for your pair-share observations.

Do not discuss yet — that comes in the pair share.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Turn to your neighbor\
and compare your findings.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

Where do you agree? Where did your surprises differ?

:::notes
**Pair share (4 min).**

Walk around the room and listen in — note interesting threads you can pick up later. Look for students who mention:

- The CVF quadrants and their tension with each other
- Ambidexterity as holding contradictions simultaneously
- The difference between paradox and simple contradiction

No plenary report-out here; the energy flows directly into Block 1.

# Paradox & behavioral complexity {.headline-only}

## Opening remarks

:::medium
> The hallmark of a first-class leader is the ability to demonstrate contrary or opposing behaviors while maintaining a certain level of integrity, credibility and direction. *@denison1995paradox*
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture start (3 min).**

Frame the session: great leaders don't just pick a side when facing competing demands. They hold both sides simultaneously. This sounds abstract — but it is deeply practical. Today we will build three frameworks for understanding and navigating this reality.
:::

## What is a paradox? {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What is a contradiction,\
what a paradox?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Brief plenary (3 min).**

Let students share their intuitive understanding before introducing the formal definitions. Many conflate the two. The key distinction: contradictions are either/or; paradoxes are both/and tensions that persist over time and resist simple resolution.

Collect answers on the board in two columns. Then reveal the formal definitions on the next slide.
:::

## Paradox vs. contradiction

**Contradiction** refers to bipolar opposites that are mutually exclusive and interdependent such that the opposites define and potentially negate each other [@putnam2016contradictions, p 6].

:::fragment
:::small
For instance, supervisors who treat employees' requests for family concerns as "taking away time from the office" reinforce the belief that work and family are incongruent, and thus negate each other.
:::
:::

:::fragment
**Paradox** refers to contradictions that persist over time, impose and reflect back on each other, and develop into seemingly irrational or absurd situations because their continuity creates situations in which options appear mutually exclusive [@putnam2016contradictions, p 8].
:::

:::fragment
:::small
For example, "the more autonomy that employees have, the harder they work, the more hours they devote, and the more that organizations control their lives" is paradoxical.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each definition with its example. Emphasize the temporal dimension: contradictions can be resolved by choosing one side; paradoxes persist because choosing one side intensifies the other.

Ask: "Can you think of a paradox from your own work or study experience?" Take 1–2 quick examples. This bridges to ambidexterity.
:::

## Ambidexterity {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What is ambidexterity,\
what is behavioral complexity?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Brief plenary (3 min).**

Students encountered both concepts in @lavine2014paradoxical. Let them articulate their understanding before you formalize it. This is a payoff moment for those who did the reading.

If the room is quiet, prompt: "The reading used the phrase 'organizational ambidexterity' — what did it mean?"
:::

## Ambidexterity

:::medium
> Ambidexterity refers to "an organization's capacity to address two organizationally incompatible objectives equally well." *@birkinshaw2013clarifying [p. 291]*
:::

:::fragment
The ability of senior leadership teams to embrace tension between old states and activities and new ones is a key predictor of firm success [@tushman2011ambidextrous].
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
> Leaders must "embrace inconsistency by maintaining multiple and often conflicting strategic demands." *@o2011organizational [p. 76]*
:::
:::

:::notes
Ambidexterity is the organizational-level concept. The classic example is exploiting existing business while exploring new opportunities — efficiency vs. innovation. Make sure students see that this is a *paradox* by the definition we just established.

Transition: "Ambidexterity describes what *organizations* must do. But what does it take from the *leader*? That's behavioral complexity."
:::

## Behavioral complexity

:::large
> It takes complexity to defeat complexity. *@uhl2007complexity [p. 301]*
:::

:::fragment
Increasing social and organizational complexity requires **cognitive complexity** and **behavioral complexity** — "we must conceive and perform" [@denison1995paradox, p. 524].
:::

:::fragment
Effective leaders are those who have the cognitive as well as the behavioral capacity to **recognize** and **react** to paradox, contradiction, and complexity in their environments [@denison1995paradox; @lawrence2009behavioral; @spreitzer1996empowering].
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Key points:

1. Cognitive complexity = the ability to *see* multiple competing demands simultaneously.
2. Behavioral complexity = the ability to *act* on multiple competing demands — to shift between seemingly contradictory behaviors.
3. This is not being inconsistent or unpredictable. It is a *repertoire* of leadership behaviors deployed intentionally.

Connect to [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd): "Remember the trait paradoxes? Behavioral complexity is the capacity to hold those paradoxes rather than resolving them."
:::

## Paradoxes in practice {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think of a leader you have observed (boss, coach, teacher, project lead).
:::

1. Identify a **paradox** they faced — two contradictory demands at the same time.
2. How did they handle it — did they **choose a side**, **oscillate**, or **hold both**?
3. Would you describe their approach as showing **behavioral complexity**?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group discussion (12 min total: 8 min group work, 4 min plenary).**

Form groups of 3–4. Walk around and push groups beyond generic examples toward specifics:

- "What exactly were the two contradictory demands?"
- "What behaviors did the leader show that seemed contradictory?"
- "Were they perceived as authentic or as inconsistent?"

In plenary, collect 2–3 concrete examples. Build a pattern: leaders who oscillate between extremes are perceived as inconsistent; leaders who hold both sides simultaneously are perceived as complex but authentic.

Transition: "The CVF gives us a structured way to map these competing demands."
:::

# Competing Values Framework {.headline-only}

## Opening remarks

:::medium
> The competing values framework highlights the trade-offs, tensions, contradictions, and paradoxes inherent in organizations and their leaders. *@lavine2014paradoxical [p. 194]*
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture start (3 min).**

The CVF is the theoretical backbone of this session. Students encountered it in the reading, but many will have only a surface understanding. Walk through the framework step by step using the animated SVG stack.
:::

## Competing values

:::

:::notes
**Animated build-up (8 min).**

Walk through each layer:

1. **Two dimensions**: flexibility vs. stability (vertical), internal vs. external (horizontal).
2. **Clan/Collaborate**: human development and participation produce effectiveness. Family-like, collaborative, team-oriented.
3. **Adhocracy/Create**: innovation, vision, and constant change produce effectiveness. Dynamic, entrepreneurial.
4. **Hierarchy/Control**: control and efficiency with appropriate processes produce effectiveness. Structured, process-oriented.
5. **Market/Compete**: aggressively competing and customer focus produce effectiveness. Results-oriented.
6. **Full framework**: all four are needed simultaneously, and they are inherently in tension.

Emphasize that the verbs *collaborate*, *create*, *compete*, and *control* are more accessible than the academic labels.

: CVF — management skills and leadership behaviors [@lavine2014paradoxical] {#tbl-cvf}

:::notes
Reveal each quadrant's leadership description one at a time. After all four are visible, ask: "Which quadrant feels most natural to you?" (rhetorical — they will explore this in the exercise).

Key point: most leaders have a natural home quadrant. Behavioral complexity means operating effectively in *all four*, even the uncomfortable ones.
:::

## CVF analysis exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Map a real organization onto the CVF.
:::

Choose an organization you know well (workplace, university, sports club, startup) and:

1. **Identify** which CVF quadrant dominates.
2. **Assess** which quadrant is weakest or most neglected.
3. **Describe** a leadership challenge that arises from this imbalance.
4. **Propose** what a behaviorally complex leader would do differently.

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min group work, 5 min plenary).**

Form groups of 3–4. Each group picks one organization. Provide a simple 2×2 grid template if possible.

Walk around and push for specificity:
- "Which quadrant dominates? Give a concrete example."
- "What is the cost of neglecting the weak quadrant?"
- "What would a behaviorally complex response look like in practice?"

In plenary, have 2–3 groups share. Build the pattern: imbalances create predictable pathologies (e.g., too much *control* stifles innovation; too much *create* leads to chaos).

Transition: "The CVF tells us *what* tensions exist. But *how* should leaders respond — especially when the problem itself is unclear? That's where adaptive leadership comes in. First, let's take a break."
:::

## Digital paradoxes {.discussion-slide}

:::large
How does the **digital age** influence these paradoxes?
:::

How do digital technologies amplify the paradoxes and/or enable leaders to manage them?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Brief plenary discussion (5 min).**

Collect quick responses. Expected themes:

- Digital tools enable real-time data for *control* but also enable distributed *collaboration*.
- Remote work amplifies the autonomy paradox.
- AI and automation intensify the exploit/explore tension.
- Platform companies must *compete* aggressively while *creating* new ecosystems.

Do not resolve — park these insights for Block 4 (connecting frameworks). Announce break.
:::

# Adaptive leadership {.headline-only}

## From behavioral complexity to adaptive leadership

The CVF tells us that effective leaders move flexibly across competing demands. But *how* should leaders decide which approach to use?

:::fragment
Situational and adaptive leadership theories provide concrete answers.
:::

:::notes
**Framing (2 min).**

Connect to the CVF: "The CVF maps the *space* of competing demands. Adaptive leadership helps us understand *why* some challenges resist our usual approaches — and what to do about it."

Note for students who recall [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd): we briefly mentioned contingency and situational theories in the evolution of leadership thought. Now we go deeper.
:::

## Situational leadership

The Situational Leadership model [@hersey1977management] proposes that leaders should adapt their style based on the **readiness level** of their followers.

:::fragment
| Follower readiness | Leadership style | Leader behavior |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Low ability, low willingness | **Telling** (S1) | High task, low relationship |
| Low ability, high willingness | **Selling** (S2) | High task, high relationship |
| High ability, low willingness | **Participating** (S3) | Low task, high relationship |
| High ability, high willingness | **Delegating** (S4) | Low task, low relationship |
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Situational leadership serves as a bridge model. Its core insight: there is no single best leadership style. The most effective approach depends on the development level of the people you lead.

Key limitation to flag: situational leadership assumes that the *problem itself* is well-defined and the *solution* is known. What happens when the problem itself is unclear? Transition: "This is where adaptive leadership enters."
:::

## Technical vs. adaptive challenges

@heifetz1994leadership distinguishes two fundamentally different types of challenges:

::::columns
:::{.column width="48%"}
:::fragment
**Technical problems**

- Problem definition is clear
- Solution is known
- Expert knowledge can solve it
- Implementation through authority

*Example: A hospital needs to upgrade its IT system — requirements are known, vendors can be evaluated.*
:::
:::

:::{.column width="48%"}
:::fragment
**Adaptive challenges**

- Problem definition is unclear
- No known solution exists
- Requires learning and changed behavior
- Implementation through engagement

*Example: A hospital needs to fundamentally change its culture to reduce medical errors.*
:::
:::
::::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The most common leadership failure, @heifetz1994leadership argues, is treating adaptive challenges as if they were technical problems.

Digital transformation is the quintessential adaptive challenge: it is not primarily a technology problem (technical) but a problem of changed behaviors, processes, mental models, and organizational culture (adaptive). Leaders who approach DT as a technology implementation project often fail.
:::

## Think-Pair-Share {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think of a challenge from your own experience\
(work, study, personal project).
:::

1. Was it a **technical problem** or an **adaptive challenge**?
2. How was it treated — technically or adaptively?
3. If there was a mismatch, what were the consequences?

:::small
2 minutes individual thinking\
3 minutes pair discussion.
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Think-Pair-Share (8 min total: 5 min TPS + 3 min plenary).**

Expected patterns: students often describe situations where adaptive challenges were treated technically (e.g., "We bought new software to fix a communication problem" or "We reorganized the team structure instead of addressing trust issues").

Probing questions for plenary:
- "What happened when the technical solution was applied to the adaptive challenge?"
- "What would an adaptive approach have looked like instead?"

Transition: "So how do leaders actually lead through adaptive challenges? Heifetz identifies four key practices."
:::

## Key practices of adaptive leadership

@heifetz2002leadership identify four key practices:

:::incremental
1. **Getting on the balcony** — Step back from the action to observe patterns, political dynamics, and systemic issues.
2. **Regulating distress** — Create enough disequilibrium to motivate change, but not so much that people become overwhelmed.
3. **Giving the work back** — The people with the problem must do the work of adapting. The leader creates conditions for this learning.
4. **Protecting voices from below** — People closest to the problem often have critical insights. Adaptive leaders protect and amplify dissenting voices.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

For each practice, give a brief concrete example:

1. **Balcony**: A project manager who pauses a heated meeting to ask "What pattern are we repeating here?"
2. **Regulating distress**: Announcing a restructuring (creates disequilibrium) while simultaneously providing a clear timeline and support (contains distress).
3. **Giving work back**: Instead of deciding how to implement a new process, the leader facilitates a workshop where the team designs it themselves.
4. **Protecting voices**: A senior leader publicly supports an intern's dissenting view in a meeting.

Key point: these practices require a fundamentally different orientation. Rather than providing answers, the adaptive leader asks questions.
:::

# Connecting the frameworks {.headline-only}

## Adaptive challenges require the full CVF

:::medium
Adaptive challenges require movement across all four CVF quadrants:
:::

:::incremental
- **Collaborate** — facilitate group learning and create psychological safety for experimentation
- **Create** — experiment with novel approaches and tolerate productive failure
- **Compete** — make difficult trade-off decisions when resources are scarce
- **Control** — establish structures that provide enough stability for people to take risks
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

This is the synthesis slide. Adaptive challenges are inherently paradoxical — they require simultaneous stability and change, direction and empowerment, urgency and patience.

Connect to the latticework from [Unit 1](../foundations/index.qmd): the CVF and adaptive leadership are both mental models that help leaders *diagnose* what type of challenge they face and *select* appropriate responses.
:::

## An integrated view

:::medium
Three lenses on the same challenge:
:::

| Framework | Asks | Insight |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **CVF** | What competing demands exist? | Map the tension landscape |
| **Situational** | What do followers need? | Match style to readiness |
| **Adaptive** | Is the problem technical or adaptive? | Choose the right mode of leadership |

:::fragment
:::medium
Together, they provide a diagnostic toolkit for behavioral complexity.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each row. A leader who can use all three lenses simultaneously is demonstrating behavioral complexity.

Connect to [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd): "The LTEE model showed that development happens at the mediator level. These frameworks *are* mediators — cognitive tools that translate your traits into effective behavior."
:::

## Framework integration exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Analyse a leadership challenge using all three frameworks.
:::

**Scenario**: A mid-sized company is implementing AI-driven customer service, replacing 30% of human agents. The remaining team is anxious, the technology is unproven, and customer satisfaction is dropping.

1. **CVF**: Which quadrants are in tension?
2. **Situational**: What do different stakeholders need?
3. **Adaptive**: Technical problem, adaptive challenge, or both?
4. **Synthesis**: What would a behaviorally complex leader do?

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min group work, 5 min plenary).**

Form groups of 4–5. Walk around and push beyond surface analysis:

- CVF: The leader needs to *control* (manage the rollout), *create* (experiment with new models), *collaborate* (support the anxious team), and *compete* (maintain customer satisfaction).
- Situational: Remaining agents are high-ability but low-willingness (anxious) — needs Participating (S3). Executives want results — needs data and accountability.
- Adaptive: Technology implementation is technical; the cultural shift is adaptive. The common mistake would be treating the whole thing as a tech project.

In plenary, have 2–3 groups share. Highlight differences in their diagnoses — this itself illustrates the value of multiple frameworks.
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Latticework update

:::medium
**Which new models have you added to your latticework?**
:::

:::fragment
- Competing values as a diagnostic framework
- Technical vs. adaptive problem distinction
- Behavioral complexity as a leadership capacity
- Inversion and both/and thinking for navigating paradox
:::

:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).**

Collect these on the board alongside the Unit 1 and Unit 2 models. Ask: "How do these new models connect to the ones we already had?"

Expected connections:
- Map vs. territory applies to the CVF — the four quadrants simplify a complex reality.
- Trait paradoxes from Unit 2 are a specific instance of the broader paradox concept.
- Second-order thinking applies to adaptive challenges — the second-order effect of a technical fix to an adaptive problem is often worse than the original problem.

Preview the homework and transition to closing.

## Closing quote {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Leadership requires the capacity to recognize and react to paradox, contradiction, and complexity.\
[@denison1995paradox]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
Let this sit for a moment. Then transition directly to homework.
:::

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Read @house1996path and answer the following questions:

:::incremental
- What is the essence of the theory?
- How does leader behavior impact subordinates' motivation, satisfaction, and performance?
- What leader behaviors have you experienced?
- Do you have empirical evidence on the propositions made?
:::

:::notes
The next reading shifts from *what* leaders do (paradox, behavioral complexity) to *why* it works (path-goal theory's motivational mechanisms). Encourage students to look for connections between the CVF quadrants and the leader behaviors described by House.

"As you read, think about which CVF quadrant each leader behavior maps to. We will build on this next session."

# Q&A {.html-hidden .unlisted .headline-only}

Open the floor for remaining questions. If time allows, ask: "What is one thing from today's session that will change how you think about a leadership situation you are currently facing?"
