# Introduction {.headline-only}

## Agenda

:::medium
- Snowball warm-up [15 min]{.smaller}
- Paradox & behavioral complexity [30 min]{.smaller}
- Competing Values Framework [30 min]{.smaller}
- [Break]{.highlight}
- Adaptive leadership [25 min]{.smaller}
- Synthesis [20 min]{.smaller}
- Reflection & closing [10 min]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
The session is designed as a flipped classroom — students have pre-read @lavine2014paradoxical and answered four guiding questions about ambidexterity, behavioral complexity, CVF paradoxes, and their digital-era relevance.

- The activation uses a **snowball discussion** (1-2-4-plenary) to surface pre-reading insights with progressively larger groups.
- The paradoxes block uses a **fishbowl** format — one group in the center discusses while others observe and then rotate.
- The adaptive leadership block uses a **devil's advocate** format — students argue opposing positions.
- The integration exercise uses **role-play** — groups represent different organizational roles.

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. **Distinguish** paradox from contradiction and explain why paradox is fundamental to contemporary organizations.
2. **Explain** the Competing Values Framework as a diagnostic tool for leadership tensions.
3. **Differentiate** technical problems from adaptive challenges using Heifetz's framework.
4. **Apply** the concept of behavioral complexity to analyze leadership situations.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
On which surprising insight can you agree on?
:::

Pair with your neighbor(s) and share your individual notes.\
Agree on your **one most surprising insight**

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

## Plenum {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Share one finding with the plenary.
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

Each pair presents their top insight.

:::notes
One spokesperson per group shares their finding.

Expected connections:

- **Inversion** — what would happen if a leader were completely inflexible?
- **Both/and thinking** — what if opposing demands are not a choice but a creative tension?
- **Trait paradoxes** from Unit 2 — every strength has a shadow
- **Map vs. territory** — our frameworks simplify complex reality

Land on: today we formalize the idea that paradox is not a flaw to be resolved but a condition to be navigated. The energy flows directly into Block 1.

# Paradox & behavioral complexity {.headline-only}

## Opening remarks

:::medium
> The hallmark of a first-class leader is the ability to demonstrate contrary or opposing behaviors while maintaining a certain level of integrity, credibility and direction. *@denison1995paradox*
:::

:::notes
Great leaders don't just pick a side when facing competing demands. They hold both sides simultaneously. This sounds abstract — but it is deeply practical. Today we will build three frameworks for understanding and navigating this reality.
:::

## What is a paradox? {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What is a contradiction,\
what a paradox?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Let students share their intuitive understanding before introducing the formal definitions. Many conflate the two. The key distinction: contradictions are either/or; paradoxes are both/and tensions that persist over time and resist simple resolution.

Collect answers on the board in two columns. Then reveal the formal definitions on the next slide.
:::

## Paradox vs. contradiction

**Contradiction** refers to bipolar opposites that are mutually exclusive and interdependent such that the opposites define and potentially negate each other [@putnam2016contradictions, p 6].

:::fragment
:::small
For instance, supervisors who treat employees' requests for family concerns as "taking away time from the office" reinforce the belief that work and family are incongruent, and thus negate each other.
:::
:::

:::fragment
**Paradox** refers to contradictions that persist over time, impose and reflect back on each other, and develop into seemingly irrational or absurd situations because their continuity creates situations in which options appear mutually exclusive [@putnam2016contradictions, p 8].
:::

:::fragment
:::small
For example, "the more autonomy that employees have, the harder they work, the more hours they devote, and the more that organizations control their lives" is paradoxical.
:::
:::

:::notes
Walk through each definition with its example. Emphasize the temporal dimension: contradictions can be resolved by choosing one side; paradoxes persist because choosing one side intensifies the other.

Ask: "Can you think of a paradox from your own work or study experience?" Take 1–2 quick examples. This bridges to ambidexterity.
:::

## Ambidexterity {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What is ambidexterity,\
what is behavioral complexity?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Students encountered both concepts in @lavine2014paradoxical. Let them articulate their understanding before you formalize it. This is a payoff moment for those who did the reading.

If the room is quiet, prompt: "The reading used the phrase 'organizational ambidexterity' — what did it mean?"
:::

## Ambidexterity

:::medium
> Ambidexterity refers to "an organization's capacity to address two organizationally incompatible objectives equally well." *@birkinshaw2013clarifying [p. 291]*
:::

:::fragment
The ability of senior leadership teams to embrace tension between old states and activities and new ones is a key predictor of firm success [@tushman2011ambidextrous].
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
> Leaders must "embrace inconsistency by maintaining multiple and often conflicting strategic demands." *@o2011organizational [p. 76]*
:::
:::

:::notes
Ambidexterity is the organizational-level concept. The classic example is exploiting existing business while exploring new opportunities — efficiency vs. innovation. Make sure students see that this is a *paradox* by the definition we just established.

Transition: "Ambidexterity describes what *organizations* must do. But what does it take from the *leader*? That's behavioral complexity."
:::

## Behavioral complexity

:::large
> It takes complexity to defeat complexity. *@uhl2007complexity [p. 301]*
:::

:::fragment
Increasing social and organizational complexity requires **cognitive complexity** and **behavioral complexity** — "we must conceive and perform" [@denison1995paradox, p. 524].
:::

:::fragment
Effective leaders are those who have the cognitive as well as the behavioral capacity to **recognize** and **react** to paradox, contradiction, and complexity in their environments [@denison1995paradox; @lawrence2009behavioral; @spreitzer1996empowering].
:::

:::notes
Key points:

1. Cognitive complexity = the ability to *see* multiple competing demands simultaneously.
2. Behavioral complexity = the ability to *act* on multiple competing demands — to shift between seemingly contradictory behaviors.
3. This is not being inconsistent or unpredictable. It is a *repertoire* of leadership behaviors deployed intentionally.

Connect to [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd): "Remember the trait paradoxes? Behavioral complexity is the capacity to hold those paradoxes rather than resolving them."
:::

## Paradoxes in practice {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think of a leader you have observed (boss, coach, teacher, project lead).
:::

1. Identify a **paradox** they faced — two contradictory demands at the same time.
2. How did they handle it — did they **choose a side**, **oscillate**, or **hold both**?
3. Would you describe their approach as showing **behavioral complexity**?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Fishbowl discussion (12 min total).**

Set up a fishbowl: 4–5 volunteers sit in a central circle; everyone else observes from the outer ring. The inner circle discusses the three questions for 6 minutes. One empty chair — any outer-ring student can sit down to contribute, and someone in the inner ring must leave.

After 6 minutes, debrief with the outer ring (4 min): "What patterns did you observe? What did you notice about how the inner group navigated the paradox of discussing paradox?" Push on:
- "Were the examples they gave true paradoxes or mere contradictions?"
- "Did the inner group itself exhibit behavioral complexity?"

Build the pattern: leaders who oscillate between extremes are perceived as inconsistent; leaders who hold both sides simultaneously are perceived as complex but authentic.

Transition: "The CVF gives us a structured way to map these competing demands."
:::

# Competing Values Framework {.headline-only}

## Opening remarks

:::medium
> The competing values framework highlights the trade-offs, tensions, contradictions, and paradoxes inherent in organizations and their leaders. *@lavine2014paradoxical [p. 194]*
:::

:::notes
The CVF is the theoretical backbone of this session. Students encountered it in the reading, but many will have only a surface understanding. Walk through the framework step by step.
:::

## Competing values

::: {.r-stack}

:::

:::notes
Walk through each layer:

1. **Two dimensions**: flexibility vs. stability (vertical), internal vs. external (horizontal).
2. **Clan/Collaborate**: human development and participation produce effectiveness. Family-like, collaborative, team-oriented.
3. **Adhocracy/Create**: innovation, vision, and constant change produce effectiveness. Dynamic, entrepreneurial.
4. **Hierarchy/Control**: control and efficiency with appropriate processes produce effectiveness. Structured, process-oriented.
5. **Market/Compete**: aggressively competing and customer focus produce effectiveness. Results-oriented.
6. **Full framework**: all four are needed simultaneously, and they are inherently in tension.

Emphasize that the verbs *collaborate*, *create*, *compete*, and *control* are more accessible than the academic labels.

: CVF — management skills and leadership behaviors [@lavine2014paradoxical] {#tbl-cvf}

:::notes
Reveal each quadrant's leadership description one at a time. After all four are visible, ask: "Which quadrant feels most natural to you?" (rhetorical — they will explore this in the exercise).

Key point: most leaders have a natural home quadrant. Behavioral complexity means operating effectively in *all four*, even the uncomfortable ones.
:::

## CVF analysis {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Map a real organization onto the CVF.
:::

Form grops of 3-4. Choose an organization you know well (workplace, university, sports club, startup) and:

1. **Identify** which CVF quadrant dominates.
2. **Assess** which quadrant is weakest or most neglected.
3. **Describe** a leadership challenge that arises from this imbalance.
4. **Propose** what a behaviorally complex leader would do differently.

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min group work, 5 min plenary).**

Walk around and push for specificity:

- "Which quadrant dominates? Give a concrete example."
- "What is the cost of neglecting the weak quadrant?"
- "What would a behaviorally complex response look like in practice?"

In plenary, have 2–3 groups share. Build the pattern: imbalances create predictable pathologies (e.g., too much *control* stifles innovation; too much *create* leads to chaos).

**The CVF tells us *what* tensions exist. But *how* should leaders respond — especially when the problem itself is unclear? That's where adaptive leadership comes in.**
:::

## Digital paradoxes {.discussion-slide}

:::large
How does the **digital age** influence these paradoxes?
:::

How do digital technologies amplify the paradoxes and/or enable leaders to manage them?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Brief plenary discussion (5 min).**

Collect quick responses. Expected themes:

- Digital tools enable real-time data for *control* but also enable distributed *collaboration*.
- Remote work amplifies the autonomy paradox.
- AI and automation intensify the exploit/explore tension.
- Platform companies must *compete* aggressively while *creating* new ecosystems.

Do not resolve — park these insights for Block 4 (connecting frameworks).
:::

# Break {.headline-only}

# Adaptive leadership {.headline-only}

:::notes

The CVF tells us that effective leaders move flexibly across competing demands. 

Adaptive leadership helps us understand *why* some challenges resist our usual approaches — and what to do about it.

We briefly mentioned contingency and situational theories in the evolution of leadership thought. Now we go deeper.
:::

## Situational leadership

The Situational Leadership model [@hersey1977management] proposes that leaders should adapt their style based on the **readiness level** of their followers.

:::fragment

| Follower readiness             | Leadership style       | Leader behavior              |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Low ability, low willingness   | **Telling** (S1)       | High task, low relationship  |
| Low ability, high willingness  | **Selling** (S2)       | High task, high relationship |
| High ability, low willingness  | **Participating** (S3) | Low task, high relationship  |
| High ability, high willingness | **Delegating** (S4)    | Low task, low relationship   |

: Follower readiness and leadership style based on @hersey1977management {#tbl-lrls}
:::

:::notes
Situational leadership serves as a bridge model. Its core insight: there is no single best leadership style. The most effective approach depends on the development level of the people you lead.

Key limitation to flag: 

- Situational leadership assumes that the *problem itself* is well-defined and the *solution* is known. 
- What happens when the problem itself is unclear? 
- This is where adaptive leadership enters ...
:::

## Technical vs. adaptive challenges

@heifetz1994leadership distinguishes two fundamentally different types of challenges:

::::columns
:::{.column width="48%"}
:::fragment
**Technical problems**

- Problem definition is clear
- Solution is known
- Expert knowledge can solve it
- Implementation through authority

*Example: A hospital needs to upgrade its IT system — requirements are known, vendors can be evaluated.*
:::
:::

:::{.column width="48%"}
:::fragment
**Adaptive challenges**

- Problem definition is unclear
- No known solution exists
- Requires learning and changed behavior
- Implementation through engagement

*Example: A hospital needs to fundamentally change its culture to reduce medical errors.*
:::
:::
::::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The most common leadership failure, @heifetz1994leadership argues, is treating adaptive challenges as if they were technical problems.

Digital transformation is the quintessential adaptive challenge: it is not primarily a technology problem (technical) but a problem of changed behaviors, processes, mental models, and organizational culture (adaptive). Leaders who approach DT as a technology implementation project often fail.
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think of a challenge from your own experience\
(work, study, personal project).
:::

Discuss with your neighbor:

1. Was it a **technical problem** or an **adaptive challenge**?
2. How was it treated — technically or adaptively?
3. If there was a mismatch, what were the consequences?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
So how do leaders actually lead through adaptive challenges? Heifetz identifies four key practices.
:::

## Key practices of adaptive leadership

@heifetz2002leadership identify four key practices:

:::incremental
1. **Getting on the balcony** — Step back from the action to observe patterns, political dynamics, and systemic issues.
2. **Regulating distress** — Create enough disequilibrium to motivate change, but not so much that people become overwhelmed.
3. **Giving the work back** — The people with the problem must do the work of adapting. The leader creates conditions for this learning.
4. **Protecting voices from below** — People closest to the problem often have critical insights. Adaptive leaders protect and amplify dissenting voices.
:::

:::notes
For each practice, give a brief concrete example:

1. **Balcony**: A project manager who pauses a heated meeting to ask "What pattern are we repeating here?"
2. **Regulating distress**: Announcing a restructuring (creates disequilibrium) while simultaneously providing a clear timeline and support (contains distress).
3. **Giving work back**: Instead of deciding how to implement a new process, the leader facilitates a workshop where the team designs it themselves.
4. **Protecting voices**: A senior leader publicly supports an intern's dissenting view in a meeting.

These practices require a fundamentally different orientation. Rather than providing answers, the adaptive leader asks questions.
:::

# Synthesis {.headline-only}

## Behavioral complexity

:::medium
Adaptive challenges require movement across all four CVF quadrants:
:::

:::incremental
- **Collaborate** — facilitate group learning and create psychological safety for experimentation
- **Create** — experiment with novel approaches and tolerate productive failure
- **Compete** — make difficult trade-off decisions when resources are scarce
- **Control** — establish structures that provide enough stability for people to take risks
:::

:::notes
Adaptive challenges are inherently paradoxical — they require simultaneous stability and change, direction and empowerment, urgency and patience.

The CVF and adaptive leadership are both mental models that help leaders *diagnose* what type of challenge they face and *select* appropriate responses.
:::

## An integrated view

Three lenses on the same challenge:

| Framework                                     | Asks                                                                  | Insight                                                              |

: Overview of frameworks {#tbl-overwview}

:::fragment
:::medium
Together, they provide a diagnostic toolkit\
for behavioral complexity.
:::
:::

:::notes
A leader who can use all three lenses simultaneously is demonstrating behavioral complexity.

The LTEE model showed that development happens at the mediator level. These frameworks *are* mediators — cognitive tools that translate your traits into effective behavior.
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Analyze a leadership challenge\
using all three frameworks.
:::

**Scenario**: A mid-sized company is implementing AI-driven customer service, replacing 30% of human agents. The remaining team is anxious, the technology is unproven, and customer satisfaction is dropping.

1. **CVF**: Which quadrants are in tension?
2. **Situational**: What do different stakeholders need (e.g., transformation lead, CEO, anxious customer-service agent, customer representative)?
3. **Adaptive**: Technical problem, adaptive challenge, or both?
4. **Synthesis**: What would a behaviorally complex leader do?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes

- CVF: The leader needs to *control* (manage the rollout), *create* (experiment with new models), *collaborate* (support the anxious team), and *compete* (maintain customer satisfaction).
- Situational: Remaining agents are high-ability but low-willingness (anxious) — needs Participating (S3).
- Adaptive: Technology implementation is technical; the cultural shift is adaptive.

Experiencing the competing demands is more powerful than analyzing them on paper.
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Latticework update {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Which new models have you added to your latticework?
:::

:::fragment
- Competing values as a diagnostic framework
- Technical vs. adaptive problem distinction
- Behavioral complexity as a leadership capacity
- Inversion and both/and thinking for navigating paradox
:::

:::notes
How do these new models connect to the ones we already had?

Expected connections:
- Map vs. territory applies to the CVF — the four quadrants simplify a complex reality.
- Trait paradoxes from Unit 2 are a specific instance of the broader paradox concept.
- Second-order thinking applies to adaptive challenges — the second-order effect of a technical fix to an adaptive problem is often worse than the original problem.
:::

## Closing remark

:::large
Leadership requires the capacity to recognize and react to paradox, contradiction, and complexity.

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Read @house1996path and answer the following questions:

:::incremental
- What is the essence of the theory?
- How does leader behavior impact subordinates' motivation, satisfaction, and performance?
- What leader behaviors have you experienced?
- Do you have empirical evidence on the propositions made?
:::

:::fragment
Look for connections between the CVF quadrants and the leader behaviors described by House.
:::

:::notes
The next reading shifts from *what* leaders do (paradox, behavioral complexity) to *why* it works (path-goal theory's motivational mechanisms).
