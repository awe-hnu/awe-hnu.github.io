2. Define psychological safety and describe its impact on team learning and performance.
3. Analyze the diversity paradox and the role of inclusion in activating diverse teams.
4. Propose leadership practices for building trust and effectiveness in virtual and distributed teams.

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Individual reflection {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Think about the **best team** and **worst team** you have ever been part of.

What does the **leader do*+ in great teams vs. terrible teams?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Expected: trust, communication, psychological safety, role clarity, shared purpose, leadership quality. 

Teams are **complex adaptive systems**.
Small changes in trust, communication, or norms can create reinforcing loops — for better or worse.
:::

# Team development {.headline-only}

## Team effectiveness

According to @hill2003becoming, an effective team is characterized by three criteria:

:::incremental
1. The team **performs**: the output meets the standards of those who have to use it
2. The team members are **satisfied and learn**: the experience contributes to each member's well-being and development
3. The team **adapts and learns**: the experience enhances the capability of members to work together in the future
:::

:::fragment
Short-term results alone do not define a successful team,\
sustainability and growth matter equally.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Emphasize that most organizations focus only on criterion 1 (performance).
But a team that delivers results while burning out its members or failing to build capacity for the future is not truly effective.

Connect to engaging leadership: engaging leaders attend to all three criteria — facilitating performance, strengthening competence, and connecting members.
:::

## Team paradoxes

Just as organizations face paradoxes ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)), so do teams [@hill2003becoming]:

:::incremental
- Embrace individual differences 	&#11108;  Embrace collective identity and goals
- Foster support 	&#11108;  Foster confrontation
- Focus on performance 	&#11108;  Focus on learning and development
- Rely on managerial authority 	&#11108;  Rely on team members' discretion and autonomy
:::

:::fragment
Navigating these paradoxes requires **behavioral complexity** — moving across the CVF quadrants depending on what the team needs.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Connect to Unit 3: these are the same paradox dynamics, now applied at the team level. The CVF quadrants map directly: *collaborate* ↔ *compete*, *create* ↔ *control*. No single quadrant suffices for complex team leadership.
:::

## Tuckman's stages

@tuckman1965developmental proposed that teams progress through predictable stages:

:::large
[Forming — ]{.fragment} [Storming — ]{.fragment} [Norming — ]{.fragment} [Performing —]{.fragment} [Adjourning^[Ajourning was added by @tuckman1977stages].]{.fragment}
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each stage briefly:

- **Forming**: politeness, uncertainty, dependence on the leader.
- **Storming**: conflict emerges, members assert perspectives. Most uncomfortable but most critical.
- **Norming**: shared norms, roles, and ways of working develop.
- **Performing**: high-level functioning, interdependence, flexibility.
- **Adjourning**: reflection, celebration, sometimes grief.

Limitation: implies linear progression that many teams don't follow. Teams can regress when facing new challenges.
:::

## Wheelan's Integrated Model

The Integrated Model of Group Development (IMGD) [@wheelan2005group] provides an empirically grounded refinement of Tuckman's stages:

:::{.fragment fragment-index="1"}

| Stage                                                                       | Focus                                                      | Key behaviors                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [(1) [Dependency & inclusion]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}    | [*Will I belong?*]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}           | [Members look to the leader for direction; communication is tentative; conflict is avoided]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}        |
| [(2) [Counterdependency & fight]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="2"} | [*Who has influence?*]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}       | [Members challenge the leader and each other; subgroups form; conflict over values and procedures]{.fragment fragment-index="2"} |
| [(3) [Trust & structure]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="3"}         | [*How do we work together?*]{.fragment fragment-index="3"} | [Mature negotiation of roles, norms, and goals; increased trust and open communication]{.fragment fragment-index="3"}            |
| [(4) [Work & productivity]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}       | [*Let's get it done.*]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}       | [High task focus; effective collaboration; flexible role allocation; constructive conflict]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}        |

: Stages of group development as proposed by the IMGD [@wheelan2005group] {#tbl-imgd}
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Key nuances beyond Tuckman:

1. Teams don't progress linearly — they can regress when facing membership changes or new tasks.
2. Most teams never reach Stage 4.
3. Time matters — teams need sufficient time together.
4. The leader's role shifts across stages.

This shifting role connects to situational leadership ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): directive → coaching → supporting → delegating maps onto development stages.
:::

## The leader's role across stages

The leader's approach must adapt as the team develops:

:::{.fragment fragment-index="1"}

| Team stage                                                | Leadership approach                           | Key actions                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Dependency & inclusion]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}    | [[Directive]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="1"} | [Provide clear structure, establish safety, model expected behavior]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}    |
| [Counterdependency & fight]{.fragment fragment-index="2"} | [[Coaching]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="2"} | [Normalize conflict, facilitate dialogue, protect minority voices]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}      |
| [Trust & structure]{.fragment fragment-index="3"}         | [[Supporting]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="3"} | [Encourage self-management, support emerging norms, delegate decisions]{.fragment fragment-index="3"} |
| [Work & productivity]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}       | [[Delegating]{.highlight}]{.fragment fragment-index="4"} | [Manage boundaries, secure resources, remove obstacles]{.fragment fragment-index="4"}                 |

: The leader's role across stages {#tbl-leadersRole}

:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This maps onto the situational leadership model from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd) [@hersey1977management]. The leader does not become less important — but the nature of the contribution changes from providing answers to creating conditions.

Also adaptive leadership in action: in early stages, challenges are mostly *technical*. As the team matures, challenges become more *adaptive*.
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What stage is this team in?
:::

Read each brief scenario and diagnose:\
What Wheelan stage?\
What leadership approach is needed?

1. Team members defer all decisions to the project manager. Nobody pushes back.
2. Two subgroups have formed and argue about the project approach in every meeting.
3. The team has developed clear sprint rituals and members freely pick up each other's tasks.

{{< countdown "12:00" top="0">}}

:::notes

Expected answers:

1. Stage 1 (Dependency) — needs directive leadership, clear structure
2. Stage 2 (Counterdependency) — needs coaching, normalize the conflict
3. Stage 4 (Work & productivity) — needs delegating, boundary management

Transition: "What enables teams to move from Stage 2 to Stage 3? The answer, research shows, is psychological safety."
:::

# Psychological safety {.headline-only}

## Definition

:::medium
Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is **safe for interpersonal risk-taking**.
:::

:::fragment
@edmondson1999psychological showed that psychological safety enables **learning behavior** — asking questions, admitting mistakes, seeking feedback, experimenting — which drives **team performance**.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The research began with a puzzling finding: the best-performing hospital teams reported *more* errors.
It turned out they had higher psychological safety, so members felt safe to report and discuss errors — leading to more learning and fewer repeated mistakes.

Key insight: psychological safety is not about being nice. It is about creating an environment where people feel safe to be candid.
:::

## Project Aristotle

Google's **Project Aristotle** confirmed and extended these findings [@google_rework_teams]:

:::fragment
:::medium
Psychological safety was the **#1 predictor**\
of team effectiveness at Google.
:::
:::

:::fragment
The five key dynamics (in order):
:::

:::incremental
1. **Psychological safety** — Can we take risks without feeling insecure?
2. **Dependability** — Can we count on each other?
3. **Structure & clarity** — Are goals, roles, and plans clear?
4. **Meaning** — Is the work personally important?
5. **Impact** — Do we believe our work matters?
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Project Aristotle studied 180+ teams over two years. They expected team composition to be key — instead, *how* teams worked together mattered far more than *who* was on the team.

This reinforces a key course message: leadership is not just about selecting the right people (traits, [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) — it is about creating the right conditions.
:::

## Creating psychological safety

@edmondson2018fearless proposed three categories of action in her *"Leader Tool Kit"*:

:::incremental
- **Setting the Stage** creates the rationale for speaking up.
- **Inviting Participation** creates the opportunity to speak up.
- **Responding Productively** creates the orientation for continued speaking up.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Creating psychological safety is a leadership practice, not a one-time event. 
A single punitive response to a mistake can destroy months of trust-building.

Connect to engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)): *facilitating* (autonomy), *connecting* (relatedness), and *strengthening* (competence) all contribute to psychological safety. Disengaging leadership destroys it.
:::

## Discussion {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Psychological safety is **not** about lowering standards or avoiding disagreement.
:::

|                                         | Low accountability                                  | High accountability                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [High psychological safety]{.highlight} | *Comfort zone* — people feel safe but aren't challenged | *Learning zone* — people feel safe AND are held to high standards |
| [Low psychological safety]{.highlight}                | *Apathy zone* — people don't care and aren't pushed   | *Anxiety zone* — people are stressed and afraid to take risks   |

: The 2×2 framework of psychological safety [@edmondson1999psychological] {#tbl-comfortZone}

How would you move a team from the anxiety zone to the learning zone?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Psychological safety is sometimes misunderstood as "being nice." In fact, the most effective teams combine safety with rigorous standards. This connects to team paradoxes: *foster support &#11108; foster confrontation*.
:::

# Diversity & inclusion {.headline-only}

## The diversity paradox

:::medium
Diverse teams have **higher potential**\
*and* **higher process loss**.
:::

:::fragment
Diversity increases the range of perspectives, knowledge, and ideas available to the team, but it also increases the potential for misunderstanding, conflict, and coordination challenges [@stahl2010unraveling].
:::

:::incremental
- Diverse teams are better at generating creative solutions and avoiding groupthink
- But they can also experience more communication breakdowns, slower decision-making, and stronger in-group/out-group dynamics
- @vanknippenberg2004diversity shows that **inclusion** (i.e., avoiding "social categorization") is the mechanism that allows teams to elaborate on their differences rather than clashing over them
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Simply assembling a diverse team is not enough — and can backfire without inclusive practices. Without psychological safety, diverse members may self-censor or disengage. The team bears the coordination costs without reaping cognitive benefits.

This is why psychological safety is a *prerequisite* for diversity to work.
:::

## Inclusion as leadership practice

Inclusion is what **activates** the potential of diversity:

:::incremental
- **Voice Equity:** mitigating "dominance hierarchies" to ensure participation is distributed, regardless of status or seniority [@edmondson2018fearless].
- **Perspective-raking:** the cognitive process of stepping into another's shoes, which reduces bias and improves "information elaboration" [@galinsky2008perspective].
- **Belonging Cues:** high-frequency social signals that create a "safe connection," signaling that the individual is a vital part of the future of the group [@coyle2018culture].
- **Constructive Dissent Norms:** institutionalizing "task conflict" while minimizing "relationship conflict" to surface unique perspectives [@jehn1995multimethod].
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Inclusion connects directly to psychological safety — inclusion *is* psychological safety applied to the challenge of diversity. A psychologically safe but homogeneous team misses innovation benefits. A diverse but unsafe team suppresses the very perspectives that make diversity valuable.
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Analyze and propose interventions.
:::

- **Scenario A**: In a product team, the three engineers dominate technical discussions while two designers rarely speak. Recent design decisions have been technically sound but user experience has suffered.
- **Scenario B**: A global marketing team has members from 5 countries. Video calls are always led by the US-based members, with Asian team members rarely contributing until asked directly.

For each discuss in groups of 3

- What is the inclusion problem?
- What specific practices would you implement?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (12 min: 8 min groups, 4 min plenary).**

Expected analysis:

- Scenario A: Voice equity problem. Solutions: rotate facilitation, structured input rounds, separate design reviews.
- Scenario B: Cultural + power distance issue. Solutions: async input before calls, rotating time zones, explicit norms for contribution, check-ins with quieter members.

Push groups to connect solutions to specific concepts: psychological safety, engaging leadership, CVF quadrants.
:::

# Virtual teams {.headline-only}

## Swift trust

@meyerson1996swift introduced **swift trust** for virtual teams:

:::fragment
:::medium
In the absence of time for traditional trust-building, members make an initial decision to **act as if trust exists**.
:::
:::

:::fragment
Swift trust is fragile: it must be confirmed through early interactions and consistent follow-through. A single violation can shatter it.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Swift trust explains why some virtual teams perform well from the start while others struggle. Teams that begin with clear role expectations, professional introductions, and early quick wins maintain trust. Teams that begin with ambiguity and missed deadlines quickly lose it.

For leaders: the first interactions in a virtual team are disproportionately important.
:::

## Leading virtual teams

Practical leadership practices for virtual teams:

:::incremental
- **Structured communication rhythms** — establish regular check-ins, stand-ups, and retrospectives that create predictability and connection
- **Explicit norms** — make implicit expectations explicit (response time expectations, camera-on/off policies, decision-making processes) since unspoken norms cannot be absorbed through osmosis at a distance
- **Intentional relationship building** — create deliberate space for non-task interaction (virtual coffee chats, personal check-ins) that replaces the coffee-machine conversations lost in virtual settings
- **Technology choices with purpose** — match the communication tool to the message type (quick questions in chat; complex discussions per video; documentation in shared documents only) rather than defaulting to the easiest option
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Leading virtual teams requires more deliberate, structured leadership than co-located teams. What happens naturally in a shared office must be intentionally designed.

Connect to the latticework: understanding team stages helps diagnose virtual team struggles. Understanding psychological safety helps design meeting practices. Understanding SDT ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)) helps create autonomy without losing connection.
:::

## Integrated case exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Diagnose the team and propose interventions.
:::

A newly formed **cross-functional project team** has been tasked with developing a digital customer portal. Members from IT, marketing, customer service, and finance — some co-located, some remote. After three weeks:

- The IT and marketing members frequently clash over priorities
- Remote members rarely speak up in meetings
- The team has missed its first milestone
- One senior member dominates discussions

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes

- What Wheelan stage is this team in?
- Where is psychological safety breaking down?
- What inclusion problems are visible?
- What should the leader do differently?

Expected diagnosis:
Stage 2 (counterdependency & fight), low psychological safety, unmanaged diversity, virtual team inclusion problems.
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Latticework update

:::medium
Which new models have you added to your latticework?
:::

:::incremental
- Stages of group development (team as evolving system/emergent phenomena)
- Psychological safety as team learning enabler
:::

:::notes
- Behavioral complexity applies to team leadership — different stages require different approaches.
- Engaging leadership creates the conditions for psychological safety.
- Feedback loops: psychological safety → learning behavior → performance → reinforced safety.
:::

## Closing quote

:::medium
Psychological safety is not about being nice — it is about giving candid feedback, openly admitting mistakes, and learning from each other 
[@edmondson1999psychological].
:::

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Reflect on a conflict you have observed in a team or organization:

- What were the **sources** of the conflict (structural, interpersonal, resource-based)?
- Was the conflict **functional** (productive) or **dysfunctional** (destructive)?
- How was it **managed** — and what would you have done differently?
