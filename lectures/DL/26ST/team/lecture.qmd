# Introduction {.headline-only}

## Today's session

:::medium
- Activation & check-in [15 min]{.smaller}
- Team development models [30 min]{.smaller}
- Psychological safety [25 min]{.smaller}
- [Break]{.highlight}
- Diversity & inclusion [25 min]{.smaller}
- Virtual teams & case exercise [25 min]{.smaller}
- Reflection & closing [10 min]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
135 minutes total.

There is no specific pre-reading for this unit. The activation is experience-based: students reflect on their best and worst team experiences.

- The team development section combines mini-lecture with diagnosis exercises.
- Psychological safety is the centerpiece — connect it to engaging leadership (Unit 4) and prepare ground for Unit 6 (conflict).
- The case exercise at the end integrates all concepts and provides a realistic team leadership scenario.
:::

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. **Explain** team development stages and the shifting leadership role across them
2. **Define** psychological safety and describe its impact on team learning and performance
3. **Analyse** the diversity paradox and the role of inclusion in activating diverse teams
4. **Propose** leadership practices for building trust and effectiveness in virtual and distributed teams
:::

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Best team / worst team {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Think about the **best team** and **worst team** you have ever been part of.
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Individual reflection (3 min).**

Ask students to write down 3 keywords for each: what made the best team great? What made the worst team terrible? This activates personal experience before theory.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Compare your best and worst team experiences with your neighbor.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

What patterns do you notice?

:::notes
**Pair share (4 min).**

Walk around and listen. Common patterns you'll hear: trust, communication, shared goals (best teams); conflict avoidance, unclear roles, dominant members (worst teams).

These patterns map directly to the concepts we'll cover: team development stages, psychological safety, and inclusion.
:::

## Plenary debrief {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What were the key differences between best and worst teams?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Plenary (5 min).**

Collect responses on the board in two columns. As patterns emerge, preview the session: "Today we'll build frameworks to understand *why* some teams thrive and others fail — and what leaders can do about it."

Expected themes: trust, communication, psychological safety, role clarity, shared purpose, leadership quality. Frame: "These aren't random — research gives us specific models."

Connect to previous units: "Teams are **complex adaptive systems** (Unit 1). Small changes in trust, communication, or norms can create reinforcing loops — for better or worse."
:::

# Team development {.headline-only}

## Team effectiveness

According to @hill2003becoming, an effective team is characterized by three criteria:

:::incremental
1. The team *performs*: the output meets the standards of those who have to use it
2. The team members are *satisfied and learn*: the experience contributes to each member's well-being and development
3. The team *adapts and learns*: the experience enhances the capability of members to work together in the future
:::

:::fragment
Short-term results alone do not define a successful team — sustainability and growth matter equally.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Emphasize that most organizations focus only on criterion 1 (performance). But a team that delivers results while burning out its members or failing to build capacity for the future is not truly effective.

Connect to engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../environments/index.qmd)): engaging leaders attend to all three criteria — facilitating performance, strengthening competence, and connecting members.
:::

## Team paradoxes

Just as organizations face paradoxes ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)), so do teams [@hill2003becoming]:

:::incremental
- Embrace individual differences 	&#11108;  Embrace collective identity and goals
- Foster support 	&#11108;  Foster confrontation
- Focus on performance 	&#11108;  Focus on learning and development
- Rely on managerial authority 	&#11108;  Rely on team members' discretion and autonomy
:::

:::fragment
Navigating these paradoxes requires **behavioral complexity** — moving across the CVF quadrants depending on what the team needs.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Connect to Unit 3: these are the same paradox dynamics, now applied at the team level. The CVF quadrants map directly: *collaborate* ↔ *compete*, *create* ↔ *control*. No single quadrant suffices for complex team leadership.
:::

## Tuckman's stages

@tuckman1965developmental proposed that teams progress through predictable stages:

:::fragment
:::medium
[Forming — ]{.fragment}[Storming — ]{.fragment}[Norming — ]{.fragment}[Performing]{.fragment}[ — Adjourning]{.fragment}
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each stage briefly:

- **Forming**: politeness, uncertainty, dependence on the leader.
- **Storming**: conflict emerges, members assert perspectives. Most uncomfortable but most critical.
- **Norming**: shared norms, roles, and ways of working develop.
- **Performing**: high-level functioning, interdependence, flexibility.
- **Adjourning**: reflection, celebration, sometimes grief.

Limitation: implies linear progression that many teams don't follow. Teams can regress when facing new challenges.
:::

## Wheelan's Integrated Model

The IMGD [@wheelan2005group] provides an empirically grounded refinement:

:::fragment
| Stage | Focus | Key behaviors |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Stage 1: Dependency & inclusion** | "Will I belong?" | Members look to leader for direction |
| **Stage 2: Counterdependency & fight** | "Who has influence?" | Members challenge leader and each other |
| **Stage 3: Trust & structure** | "How do we work together?" | Mature negotiation of roles and norms |
| **Stage 4: Work & productivity** | "Let's get it done." | Effective collaboration, flexible roles |
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Key nuances beyond Tuckman:

1. Teams don't progress linearly — they can regress when facing membership changes or new tasks.
2. Most teams never reach Stage 4.
3. Time matters — teams need sufficient time together.
4. The leader's role shifts across stages.

This shifting role connects to situational leadership ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): directive → coaching → supporting → delegating maps onto development stages.
:::

## The leader's role across stages

| Team stage | Leadership approach | Key actions |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Dependency & inclusion | **Directive** | Provide clear structure, establish safety |
| Counterdependency & fight | **Coaching** | Normalize conflict, facilitate dialogue |
| Trust & structure | **Supporting** | Encourage self-management, delegate decisions |
| Work & productivity | **Delegating** | Manage boundaries, secure resources |

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This maps onto the situational leadership model from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd) [@hersey1977management]. The leader does not become less important — but the nature of the contribution changes from providing answers to creating conditions.

Also adaptive leadership in action: in early stages, challenges are mostly *technical*. As the team matures, challenges become more *adaptive*.
:::

## Stage diagnosis exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What stage is this team in?
:::

Read each brief scenario and diagnose: What Wheelan stage? What leadership approach is needed?

1. Team members defer all decisions to the project manager. Nobody pushes back.
2. Two subgroups have formed and argue about the project approach in every meeting.
3. The team has developed clear sprint rituals and members freely pick up each other's tasks.

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (12 min total: 8 min groups, 4 min plenary).**

Form groups of 3–4. Each group diagnoses all three scenarios.

Expected answers:
1. Stage 1 (Dependency) — needs directive leadership, clear structure
2. Stage 2 (Counterdependency) — needs coaching, normalize the conflict
3. Stage 4 (Work & productivity) — needs delegating, boundary management

In plenary, push beyond diagnosis: "What specific actions would you take as leader?" and "What would happen if you used the *wrong* leadership approach for this stage?"

Transition: "What enables teams to move from Stage 2 to Stage 3? The answer, research shows, is psychological safety."
:::

# Psychological safety {.headline-only}

## Definition

:::medium
Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is **safe for interpersonal risk-taking**.
:::

:::fragment
@edmondson1999psychological showed that psychological safety enables **learning behavior** — asking questions, admitting mistakes, seeking feedback, experimenting — which drives **team performance**.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The research began with a puzzling finding: the best-performing hospital teams reported *more* errors. It turned out they had higher psychological safety, so members felt safe to report and discuss errors — leading to more learning and fewer repeated mistakes.

Key insight: psychological safety is not about being nice. It is about creating an environment where people feel safe to be candid.
:::

## Project Aristotle

Google's **Project Aristotle** confirmed and extended these findings:

:::fragment
:::medium
Psychological safety was the **#1 predictor** of team effectiveness at Google.
:::
:::

:::fragment
The five key dynamics (in order):

1. **Psychological safety** — Can we take risks without feeling insecure?
2. **Dependability** — Can we count on each other?
3. **Structure & clarity** — Are goals, roles, and plans clear?
4. **Meaning** — Is the work personally important?
5. **Impact** — Do we believe our work matters?
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Project Aristotle studied 180+ teams over two years. They expected team composition to be key — instead, *how* teams worked together mattered far more than *who* was on the team.

This reinforces a key course message: leadership is not just about selecting the right people (traits, [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) — it is about creating the right conditions.
:::

## How leaders create psychological safety

:::incremental
1. **Model vulnerability** — Acknowledge your own mistakes. When the leader says "I don't know," it signals fallibility is acceptable.
2. **Frame failure as learning** — Ask "What can we learn?" rather than "Who is responsible?"
3. **Invite input actively** — Don't just have an "open door" — actively solicit perspectives, especially from quieter members.
4. **Respond productively** — How the leader responds to the *first* person who speaks up determines whether others follow.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Creating psychological safety is a leadership practice, not a one-time event. A single punitive response to a mistake can destroy months of trust-building.

Connect to engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../environments/index.qmd)): *facilitating* (autonomy), *connecting* (relatedness), and *strengthening* (competence) all contribute to psychological safety. Disengaging leadership destroys it.
:::

## Psychological safety ≠ comfort zone {.discussion-slide}

|  | **Low accountability** | **High accountability** |
|---|---|---|
| **High psychological safety** | *Comfort zone* | *Learning zone* |
| **Low psychological safety** | *Apathy zone* | *Anxiety zone* |

:::fragment
:::medium
The goal is the **learning zone**: high psychological safety *combined with* high standards.
:::
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

How would you move a team from the anxiety zone to the learning zone?

:::notes
**Brief discussion (7 min: 5 min pairs, 2 min plenary).**

The distinction is critical: psychological safety is sometimes misunderstood as "being nice." In fact, the most effective teams combine safety with rigorous standards.

This connects to team paradoxes: *foster support &#11108; foster confrontation*. Psychological safety is what makes it possible to hold this paradox.

Push students: "What does it look like in practice to have high standards AND high safety?"
:::

# Diversity & inclusion {.headline-only}

## The diversity paradox

:::medium
Diverse teams have **higher potential** *and* **higher process loss**.
:::

:::fragment
The diversity paradox: diversity increases perspectives and ideas, but also increases potential for misunderstanding and conflict.
:::

:::incremental
- Diverse teams are better at creative solutions and avoiding groupthink
- But they can experience more communication breakdowns and slower decisions
- The **difference** between high-performing and low-performing diverse teams is **inclusion**
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Simply assembling a diverse team is not enough — and can backfire without inclusive practices. Without psychological safety, diverse members may self-censor or disengage. The team bears the coordination costs without reaping cognitive benefits.

This is why psychological safety is a *prerequisite* for diversity to work.
:::

## Inclusion as leadership practice

Inclusion is what **activates** the potential of diversity:

:::incremental
- **Voice equity** — ensuring all members have equal opportunity to contribute
- **Perspective-taking** — actively seeking to understand others' viewpoints
- **Belonging cues** — small but powerful signals that each member is valued
- **Constructive dissent norms** — making it normal to disagree respectfully
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Inclusion connects directly to psychological safety — inclusion *is* psychological safety applied to the challenge of diversity. A psychologically safe but homogeneous team misses innovation benefits. A diverse but unsafe team suppresses the very perspectives that make diversity valuable.
:::

## Inclusion scenario exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Analyse and propose interventions.
:::

**Scenario A**: In a product team, the three engineers dominate technical discussions while two designers rarely speak. Recent design decisions have been technically sound but user experience has suffered.

**Scenario B**: A global marketing team has members from 5 countries. Video calls are always led by the US-based members, with Asian team members rarely contributing until asked directly.

For each: What is the inclusion problem? What specific practices would you implement?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (12 min: 8 min groups, 4 min plenary).**

Expected analysis:
- Scenario A: Voice equity problem. Solutions: rotate facilitation, structured input rounds, separate design reviews.
- Scenario B: Cultural + power distance issue. Solutions: async input before calls, rotating time zones, explicit norms for contribution, check-ins with quieter members.

Push groups to connect solutions to specific concepts: psychological safety, engaging leadership, CVF quadrants.
:::

# Virtual teams & case exercise {.headline-only}

## Swift trust

@meyerson1996swift introduced **swift trust** for virtual teams:

:::fragment
:::medium
In the absence of time for traditional trust-building, members make an initial decision to **act as if trust exists**.
:::
:::

:::fragment
Swift trust is fragile: it must be confirmed through early interactions and consistent follow-through. A single violation can shatter it.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Swift trust explains why some virtual teams perform well from the start while others struggle. Teams that begin with clear role expectations, professional introductions, and early quick wins maintain trust. Teams that begin with ambiguity and missed deadlines quickly lose it.

For leaders: the first interactions in a virtual team are disproportionately important.
:::

## Practical virtual team practices

:::incremental
- **Structured communication rhythms** — regular check-ins, stand-ups, retrospectives
- **Explicit norms** — make implicit expectations explicit (response times, camera policies, decision-making)
- **Intentional relationship building** — deliberate space for non-task interaction
- **Technology choices with purpose** — match tool to message type
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Leading virtual teams requires more deliberate, structured leadership than co-located teams. What happens naturally in a shared office must be intentionally designed.

Connect to the latticework: understanding team stages helps diagnose virtual team struggles. Understanding psychological safety helps design meeting practices. Understanding SDT ([Unit 4](../environments/index.qmd)) helps create autonomy without losing connection.
:::

## Integrated case exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Diagnose the team and propose interventions.
:::

A newly formed **cross-functional project team** has been tasked with developing a digital customer portal. Members from IT, marketing, customer service, and finance — some co-located, some remote. After three weeks:

- The IT and marketing members frequently clash over priorities
- Remote members rarely speak up in meetings
- The team has missed its first milestone
- One senior member dominates discussions

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min: 10 min groups, 5 min plenary).**

Expected diagnosis: Stage 2 (counterdependency & fight), low psychological safety, unmanaged diversity, virtual team inclusion problems.

Possible interventions: facilitate the IT-marketing conflict (normalize storming); create explicit meeting norms (round-robin input); structured one-on-ones with remote members; address the dominant member privately; run a retrospective.

Challenge groups to connect proposals to specific concepts: Which CVF quadrant? How does it affect psychological safety? What Wheelan stage does it move the team toward?
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Latticework update

:::medium
**Which new models have you added to your latticework?**
:::

:::fragment
- Stages of group development (team as evolving system)
- Psychological safety as team learning enabler
- Complex adaptive systems — teams as emergent phenomena
:::

:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).**

Collect on the board alongside earlier models. Ask: "How do these connect to what we already had?"

Expected connections:
- Behavioral complexity (Unit 3) applies to team leadership — different stages require different approaches.
- Engaging leadership (Unit 4) creates the conditions for psychological safety.
- Feedback loops: psychological safety → learning behavior → performance → reinforced safety.
:::

## Closing quote {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Psychological safety is not about being nice — it is about giving candid feedback, openly admitting mistakes, and learning from each other.\
[@edmondson1999psychological]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
Let this sit. Then transition to homework.
:::

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Reflect on a conflict you have observed in a team or organization:

:::incremental
- What were the **sources** of the conflict (structural, interpersonal, resource-based)?
- Was the conflict **functional** (productive) or **dysfunctional** (destructive)?
- How was it **managed** — and what would you have done differently?
:::

:::notes
This reflection prepares for Unit 6 on conflict and power. Students should arrive with a concrete conflict example they can analyze using the Thomas-Kilmann framework and Glasl's escalation model.
