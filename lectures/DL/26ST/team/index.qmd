Teams are **complex adaptive systems**.
Small changes in trust, communication, or norms can create reinforcing loops — for better or worse.

# Effective teams {.headline-only}

## Characteristics

According to @hill2003becoming, an effective team does not only involve [team performance]{.highlight}, but is characterized by three criteria:

:::incremental
1. The team **performs**: the output meets the standards of those who have to use it
2. The team members are **satisfied and learn** (i.e., the team experience contributes to each member's personal well-being and development)
3. The team **adapts and learns** (i.e., the team experience enhances the capability of members to work and learn together in the future)
:::

:::fragment
These criteria remind us that short-term results alone do not define a successful team, but that sustainability and growth matter equally.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Emphasize that most organizations focus only on criterion 1 (performance).
But a team that delivers results while burning out its members or failing to build capacity for the future is not truly effective.

Connect to engaging leadership: engaging leaders attend to all three criteria — facilitating performance, strengthening competence, and connecting members.
:::
:::

## Team paradoxes

Just as organizations face paradoxes ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd#paradoxes-in-leadership)), so do teams. Committed leaders need to be aware of at least four contradictory forces in team work and deal with these paradoxes [@hill2003becoming]:

:::incremental
- Embrace individual differences 	&#11108;  Embrace collective identity and goals
- Foster support 	&#11108;  Foster confrontation
- Focus on performance 	&#11108;  Focus on learning and development
- Rely on managerial authority 	&#11108;  Rely on team members' discretion and autonomy
:::

:::fragment
Navigating these paradoxes requires **behavioral complexity** — the ability to move across the CVF quadrants depending on what the team needs at a given moment.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Connect to Unit 3: these are the same paradox dynamics, now applied at the team level. The CVF quadrants map directly: *collaborate* ↔ *compete*, *create* ↔ *control*. No single quadrant suffices for complex team leadership.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Remember the competing values framework from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd#competing-values-framework): effective team leadership requires moving fluidly between *collaborate* (building trust and belonging), *create* (encouraging experimentation), *compete* (driving results), and *control* (establishing clear processes). No single quadrant suffices for the complex demands of team leadership.

# Team development {.headline-only}

## Tuckman's stage model

@tuckman1965developmental proposed that teams progress through predictable stages:

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::large
[Forming — ]{.fragment} [Storming — ]{.fragment} [Norming — ]{.fragment} [Performing —]{.fragment} [Adjourning^[Ajourning was added by @tuckman1977stages].]{.fragment}
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each stage briefly:

- **Forming**: politeness, uncertainty, dependence on the leader.
- **Storming**: conflict emerges, members assert perspectives. Most uncomfortable but most critical.
- **Norming**: shared norms, roles, and ways of working develop.
- **Performing**: high-level functioning, interdependence, flexibility.
- **Adjourning**: reflection, celebration, sometimes grief.

Limitation: implies linear progression that many teams don't follow. Teams can regress when facing new challenges.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

**Forming**
: Team members come together, get acquainted, and explore boundaries. Characterized by politeness, uncertainty, and dependence on the leader for direction. Members are testing the waters — "Will I be accepted? What are the rules?"

**Storming**
: Conflict emerges as members assert individual perspectives, challenge authority, and compete for influence. This is the most uncomfortable but also the most critical stage — teams that avoid or suppress storming often fail to develop the trust and candor needed for high performance.

**Norming**
: The team develops shared norms, roles, and ways of working. Cohesion increases, and members begin to value the group's goals over individual agendas. A sense of "we" emerges.

**Performing**
: The team functions at a high level — members are interdependent, flexible, and focused on shared goals. Conflict is managed constructively, and the team can handle complex tasks with minimal supervision.

**Adjourning**
: The team disbands after completing its task. This stage was added by @tuckman1977stages and involves reflection, celebration, and sometimes grief over the end of meaningful working relationships.

While intuitively appealing, the model has limitations: it implies a linear progression that many teams do not follow. Teams can regress to earlier stages when facing new challenges, membership changes, or external shocks.

## Wheelan's Integrated Model of Group Development

The Integrated Model of Group Development (IMGD) [@wheelan2005group] provides an empirically grounded refinement of Tuckman's stages:

:::{.fragment fragment-index="1"}

| Stage                                                                           | Focus                                                      | Key behaviors                                                                                                                    |

**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Key nuances beyond Tuckman:

1. Teams don't progress linearly — they can regress when facing membership changes or new tasks.
2. Most teams never reach Stage 4.
3. Time matters — teams need sufficient time together.
4. The leader's role shifts across stages.

This shifting role connects to situational leadership ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): directive → coaching → supporting → delegating maps onto development stages.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The model adds several important nuances to @tuckman1965developmental:

1. **Teams don't progress linearly:** they can regress to earlier stages when facing membership changes, new tasks, or external pressures. A Stage 4 team that loses a key member may temporarily return to Stage 2 dynamics.
2. **Most teams never reach stage 4:** @wheelan2005group's research suggests that many organizational teams remain stuck in Stages 1 or 2, never developing the trust and structure needed for true high performance.
3. **Time matters:** teams need sufficient time together to develop. Short-lived project teams or teams with frequent membership changes face inherent developmental challenges.
4. **The leader's role shifts across stages:** in Stage 1, members need more direction and structure. In Stage 2, the leader must manage conflict without suppressing it. In Stage 3, the leader can increasingly delegate. In Stage 4, the leader serves primarily as a boundary manager and resource provider.
:::

## The leader's role across stages

The leader's approach must adapt as the team develops:

:::{.fragment fragment-index="1"}

This maps onto the situational leadership model from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd) [@hersey1977management]. The leader does not become less important — but the nature of the contribution changes from providing answers to creating conditions.

Also adaptive leadership in action: in early stages, challenges are mostly *technical*. As the team matures, challenges become more *adaptive*.

:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Notice how this maps onto the situational leadership model from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd#situational-leadership) [@hersey1977management]: as the team matures, the leader gradually shifts from high-task/high-relationship behavior to low-task/low-relationship behavior. The leader does not become less important — but the nature of the leadership contribution changes from providing answers to creating conditions.

This is also an example of adaptive leadership in action: in early team stages, many challenges are *technical* (establishing roles, processes, and norms). As the team matures, challenges become more *adaptive* (navigating interpersonal tensions, developing shared mental models, balancing competing priorities).

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What stage is this team in?
:::

Read each brief scenario and diagnose:\
What Wheelan stage?\
What leadership approach is needed?

1. Team members defer all decisions to the project manager. Nobody pushes back.
2. Two subgroups have formed and argue about the project approach in every meeting.
3. The team has developed clear sprint rituals and members freely pick up each other's tasks.

{{< countdown "12:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes

Expected answers:

1. Stage 1 (Dependency) — needs directive leadership, clear structure
2. Stage 2 (Counterdependency) — needs coaching, normalize the conflict
3. Stage 4 (Work & productivity) — needs delegating, boundary management

Transition: "What enables teams to move from Stage 2 to Stage 3? The answer, research shows, is psychological safety."

# Psychological safety {.headline-only}

## Definition

:::medium
Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is **safe for interpersonal risk-taking** [@edmondson1999psychological].
:::

:::fragment
@edmondson1999psychological showed that psychological safety enables **learning behavior** in teams — asking questions, admitting mistakes, seeking feedback, experimenting — which in turn drives **team performance**.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The research began with a puzzling finding: the best-performing hospital teams reported *more* errors.
It turned out they had higher psychological safety, so members felt safe to report and discuss errors — leading to more learning and fewer repeated mistakes.

Key insight: psychological safety is not about being nice. It is about creating an environment where people feel safe to be candid.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The research by @edmondson1999psychological began with a puzzling finding: the best-performing hospital nursing teams reported *more* errors, not fewer. It turned out that these teams had higher psychological safety, which meant members felt safe to report and discuss errors — leading to more learning and ultimately fewer repeated mistakes. Teams with low psychological safety underreported errors, creating an illusion of competence while actually performing worse.

The key insight: psychological safety is not about being nice or avoiding conflict. It is about creating an environment where people feel safe to be candid — to disagree, to point out problems, to ask "stupid" questions, and to admit "I don't know." This candor is the foundation of team learning.
:::

## The research evidence

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

:::medium
**Psychological safety** *leads to* **Learning behavior** *leads to* **team performance**
:::

:::fragment
Key findings from research [@edmondson1999psychological]:
:::

:::incremental
- Teams with higher psychological safety engage in more learning behaviors (seeking feedback, discussing errors, experimenting)
- Learning behavior mediates the relationship between psychological safety and team performance
- Psychological safety is a *group-level* phenomenon. It is a shared perception, not an individual trait
- Leader behavior is the strongest predictor of team psychological safety
:::

## Project Aristotle

Google's **Project Aristotle**^[Google's Project Aristotle refers to a large-scale internal study of team effectiveness] confirmed and extended these findings [@google_rework_teams]:

:::fragment
:::medium
Psychological safety was the **#1 predictor** of team effectiveness at Google, more important than team composition, structure, or individual talent.
:::
:::

:::fragment
The five key dynamics of effective teams (in order of importance):
:::

:::incremental
1. **Psychological safety** — Can we take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
2. **Dependability** — Can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time?
3. **Structure & clarity** — Are goals, roles, and plans clear?
4. **Meaning** — Is the work personally important to us?
5. **Impact** — Do we believe our work matters?
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Project Aristotle studied 180+ teams over two years. They expected team composition to be key — instead, *how* teams worked together mattered far more than *who* was on the team.

This reinforces a key course message: leadership is not just about selecting the right people (traits, [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) — it is about creating the right conditions.

Project Aristotle studied 180+ teams at Google over two years. The researchers initially expected to find that team composition (e.g., having the right mix of skills or personalities) would be the key factor. Instead, they found that *how* teams worked together mattered far more than *who* was on the team.

This finding reinforces a key message from our course: leadership is not just about selecting the right people (traits, [Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) — it is fundamentally about creating the right conditions for those people to work effectively together.
:::

## Creating psychological safety

@edmondson2018fearless proposed three categories of action in her *"Leader Tool Kit"*:

:::incremental
- **Setting the Stage** creates the rationale for speaking up.
- **Inviting Participation** creates the opportunity to speak up.
- **Responding Productively** creates the orientation for continued speaking up.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Creating psychological safety is a leadership practice, not a one-time event.
A single punitive response to a mistake can destroy months of trust-building.

Connect to engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)): *facilitating* (autonomy), *connecting* (relatedness), and *strengthening* (competence) all contribute to psychological safety. Disengaging leadership destroys it.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
According to @edmondson2018fearless, psychological safety is not about being "nice" or lowering performance standards; it is about increasing candor to enable learning.

These three steps create a reinforcing loop:

Setting the Stage
: **Frame failure as learning:** define the work as a "learning problem" rather than an "execution problem." Treat setbacks as data for improvement, asking "What can we learn?" instead of "Who is responsible?"

Inviting Participation
: **Model vulnerability:** acknowledge your own mistakes and uncertainties. When a leader says "I don't know" or "I was wrong," it creates "safety in fallibility."\
**Invite input actively** use proactive inquiry. Don't just leave the door open; actively solicit perspectives from everyone, especially quieter members, with specific, open-ended questions.

Responding Productively
: **Replace blame with curiosity:** when concerns are raised, respond with appreciation and interest. How you handle the first person who speaks up determines the team's future silence or transparency.

A single punitive response to a mistake (a "failure of responding productively") can destroy months of trust-building work.

Note the connection to engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd#engaging-leadership)): *facilitating* (autonomy), *connecting* (relatedness), and *strengthening* (competence) all contribute to psychological safety. A disengaging leader who uses coercive, eroding, or isolating behaviors will systematically destroy it.

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
This distinction is critical because psychological safety is sometimes misunderstood as "being nice" or "avoiding difficult feedback." In fact, the most effective teams combine psychological safety with rigorous standards — people feel safe to be candid *because* the team cares about quality, not despite it.

This connects to the team paradoxes we discussed earlier: *foster support &#11108; foster confrontation*. Psychological safety is what makes it possible to hold this paradox — to support people as human beings while confronting them about their work.

# Diversity & inclusion {.headline-only}

## Diversity x team performance

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
:::medium
**Cognitive diversity** is a powerful resource for team problem-solving and innovation.
:::

:::fragment
@page2007difference argues that diversity is a collection of tools (heuristics, perspectives, interpretive frameworks). He proves that a group of diverse "average" problem-solvers often outperforms a group of "top-tier" identical experts because the experts get stuck on the same hurdles.
:::

:::fragment
**Demographic diversity** serves as a vital proxy for cognitive diversity; varied life experiences and social identities provide the unique "raw materials" that expand a team's collective intelligence.
:::

Consequently, two forms of diversity can be distinguished as they have different mechanisms:

- **Cognitive diversity** directly enriches the team's information pool and problem-solving capacity. When team members bring different mental models (recall Unit 1), the team can see problems from multiple angles — like the blind men who together can describe the whole elephant.
- **Demographic diversity** does not automatically produce cognitive diversity, but it often correlates with different life experiences, professional networks, and cultural perspectives that expand the team's collective intelligence.

Diversity is a *resource* — but it is a resource that requires active management to realize its potential.

| Component             | Definition                                                   | Role in Problem-Solving                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perspectives**      | Internal representations of the world or "problem space."    | Helps the team identify **multiple possible solutions** instead of just one. |
| **Heuristics**        | Rules of thumb or specific techniques for finding solutions. | Provides different **shortcuts** or "how-to" methods to bypass obstacles.    |
| **Interpretations**   | Mental categories used to group or classify information.     | Changes how the team **frames** the problem (e.g., technical vs. social).    |
| **Predictive Models** | Causal "if/then" maps used to anticipate outcomes.           | Allows the team to **forecast** consequences from various vantage points.    |

## The diversity paradox

:::medium
Diverse teams have **higher potential**\
*and* **higher process loss**.
:::

:::fragment
Diversity increases the range of perspectives, knowledge, and ideas available to the team, but it also increases the potential for misunderstanding, conflict, and coordination challenges [@stahl2010unraveling].
:::

:::incremental
- Diverse teams are better at generating creative solutions and avoiding groupthink
- But they can also experience more communication breakdowns, slower decision-making, and stronger in-group/out-group dynamics
- @vanknippenberg2004diversity shows that **inclusion** (i.e., avoiding "social categorization") is the mechanism that allows teams to elaborate on their differences rather than clashing over them
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Simply assembling a diverse team is not enough — and can backfire without inclusive practices. Without psychological safety, diverse members may self-censor or disengage. The team bears the coordination costs without reaping cognitive benefits.

This is why psychological safety is a *prerequisite* for diversity to work.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The diversity paradox means that simply assembling a diverse team is not enough — and can even backfire if the team lacks inclusive practices. Without psychological safety and active inclusion, diverse team members may self-censor, disengage, or experience identity threat. The result: the team bears the coordination costs of diversity without reaping its cognitive benefits.

This is why psychological safety (the previous section) is a prerequisite for diversity to work: only when people feel safe to bring their full perspectives will cognitive diversity translate into better outcomes.
:::

## Inclusion

Inclusion is the set of leadership practices that **activate** the latent potential of a diverse team. Leaders bridge the gap between "having a seat at the table" and "having a voice that carries weight" through:

:::incremental
- **Voice Equity:** mitigating "dominance hierarchies" to ensure participation is distributed, regardless of status or seniority [@edmondson2018fearless].
- **Perspective-raking:** the cognitive process of stepping into another's shoes, which reduces bias and improves "information elaboration" [@galinsky2008perspective].
- **Belonging Cues:** high-frequency social signals that create a "safe connection," signaling that the individual is a vital part of the future of the group [@coyle2018culture].
- **Constructive Dissent Norms:** institutionalizing "task conflict" while minimizing "relationship conflict" to surface unique perspectives [@jehn1995multimethod].
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Inclusion connects directly to psychological safety — inclusion *is* psychological safety applied to the challenge of diversity. A psychologically safe but homogeneous team misses innovation benefits. A diverse but unsafe team suppresses the very perspectives that make diversity valuable.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Inclusion connects directly to the Categorization-Elaboration Model [@vanknippenberg2004diversity]. This model posits that diversity only works if the team "elaborates" (shares and processes) information. Without **Belonging Cues** and **Voice Equity**, "social categorization" occurs—where people see each other as "us vs. them"—which causes members to withhold their unique knowledge to avoid being seen as "different."

For leaders, this means that building a diverse team is only the first step. The harder, ongoing work is creating the conditions where diverse perspectives are genuinely heard, valued, and integrated into team decisions.

- Scenario B: Cultural + power distance issue. Solutions: async input before calls, rotating time zones, explicit norms for contribution, check-ins with quieter members.

Push groups to connect solutions to specific concepts: psychological safety, engaging leadership, CVF quadrants.

# Virtual teams {.headline-only}

## Challenges of distance

Distance is not just a geographical gap; it is a "functional barrier" that forces a shift from organic interaction to intentional leadership.

:::incremental
- **Reduced Social Context:** the lack of "media richness" (nonverbal cues/tone) increases the risk of misinterpretation and attribution bias [@daft1986information].
- **Fragility of "Swift Trust":** distance shifts trust from interpersonal (affect-based) to task-based (reliability), making it harder to sustain over time [@jarvenpaa1999communication].
- **Coordination Complexity:** distance creates "structural holes" (gaps in the flow of information) that prevent the team from picking up social cues organically. This forces a shift from implicit coordination (natural alignment) to explicit coordination (intentional, documented protocols) to bridge the gap [@hinds2005understanding].
- **Social Loafing & Isolation:** physical distance can lead to "psychological distance," where team members feel less accountable and more disconnected from the collective identity [@golden2008examining].

These challenges are not merely inconveniences — they fundamentally affect team development dynamics. Virtual teams often struggle to move through the developmental stages [@wheelan2005group] because the storming and norming processes that build trust and shared norms are harder to facilitate at a distance. Psychological safety is also more difficult to establish because leaders cannot easily read the room or notice when someone is disengaging.

This is where "digital leadership" (from Unit 1) becomes concrete: leading in the digital age increasingly means leading people you rarely or never see face-to-face.

## Swift trust

@meyerson1996swift introduced the concept of **swift trust** for temporary or virtual teams:

:::fragment
:::medium
In the absence of time to build traditional trust through repeated interactions, team members make an initial decision to **act as if trust exists** — based on role expectations, professional reputation, and institutional cues.
:::
:::

:::fragment
Swift trust is fragile: it must be confirmed through early interactions and consistent follow-through. A single violation can shatter it entirely.
:::

**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Swift trust explains why some virtual teams perform well from the start while others struggle. Teams that begin with clear role expectations, professional introductions, and early quick wins maintain trust. Teams that begin with ambiguity and missed deadlines quickly lose it.

For leaders: the first interactions in a virtual team are disproportionately important.

Swift trust helps explain why some virtual teams perform well from the start while others struggle. Teams that begin with clear role expectations, professional introductions that establish credibility, and early quick wins tend to develop and maintain swift trust. Teams that begin with ambiguity, missed deadlines, or unanswered messages quickly lose whatever initial trust existed.

For leaders, the implication is clear: the first interactions in a virtual team are disproportionately important. Invest heavily in structured kick-offs, explicit norm-setting, and early deliverables that build confidence.

## Leading virtual teams

Practical leadership practices for virtual teams:

:::incremental
- **Structured communication rhythms** — establish regular check-ins, stand-ups, and retrospectives that create predictability and connection
- **Explicit norms** — make implicit expectations explicit (response time expectations, camera-on/off policies, decision-making processes) since unspoken norms cannot be absorbed through osmosis at a distance
- **Intentional relationship building** — create deliberate space for non-task interaction (virtual coffee chats, personal check-ins) that replaces the coffee-machine conversations lost in virtual settings
- **Technology choices with purpose** — match the communication tool to the message type (quick questions in chat; complex discussions per video; documentation in shared documents only) rather than defaulting to the easiest option

Leading virtual teams requires more deliberate, structured leadership than co-located teams. What happens naturally in a shared office must be intentionally designed.

Connect to the latticework: understanding team stages helps diagnose virtual team struggles. Understanding psychological safety helps design meeting practices. Understanding SDT ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)) helps create autonomy without losing connection.

Leading virtual teams requires more deliberate, structured leadership than leading co-located teams. What happens naturally in a shared office — relationship building, norm absorption, conflict resolution through informal conversation — must be intentionally designed in virtual settings.

This is also where the latticework of mental models pays off practically. Understanding team development stages helps you diagnose why a virtual team is struggling. Understanding psychological safety helps you design virtual meeting practices that invite voice. Understanding SDT ([Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd)) helps you create autonomy without losing connection. The models compound.

## Integrated case exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Diagnose the team and propose interventions.
:::

A newly formed **cross-functional project team** has been tasked with developing a digital customer portal. Members from IT, marketing, customer service, and finance — some co-located, some remote. After three weeks:

- The IT and marketing members frequently clash over priorities
- Remote members rarely speak up in meetings
- The team has missed its first milestone
- One senior member dominates discussions

- What Wheelan stage is this team in?
- Where is psychological safety breaking down?
- What inclusion problems are visible?
- What should the leader do differently?

Expected diagnosis:
Stage 2 (counterdependency & fight), low psychological safety, unmanaged diversity, virtual team inclusion problems.

# Homework

Reflect on a conflict you have observed in a team or organization:

- What were the **sources** of the conflict (structural, interpersonal, resource-based)?
- Was the conflict **functional** (productive) or **dysfunctional** (destructive)?
- How was it **managed** — and what would you have done differently?
