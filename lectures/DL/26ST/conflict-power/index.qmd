# Introduction {.headline-only}

## A conflict scenario {.no-headline .vertical-center}

:::medium
A product manager wants to redirect engineering resources to a new customer-facing initiative. The engineering lead disagrees — her team is already stretched thin maintaining critical infrastructure. Both escalate to the VP, who needs both of them to succeed.
:::

:::fragment
Who is right? How should this be resolved? And what role does power play?
:::

:::notes
This scenario illustrates the everyday reality of organizational life: interdependence creates competing demands, and formal authority alone cannot resolve them. The VP cannot simply "decide" — she needs both leaders aligned and committed. This requires understanding power dynamics, conflict resolution, and political navigation.

In this unit, we explore how leaders exercise influence and manage the inevitable conflicts that arise in complex organizations.

## Power in organizations


Organizations can be seen [as both, **cooperative systems** of employees working together to achieve goals]{.fragment} [and **political arenas** of individuals and groups with differing interests [@brass2017intraorganizational].]{.fragment}

:::fragment
**Power** can be defined as the ability to get other people to do what you want them to do, **politics** as *power in action*, using a range of techniques and tactics [@buchanan2020power].
:::

:::fragment
Power and politics is at the heart of how organizations function [@hill2003becoming].
:::

:::fragment
Though, often associated with negative connotations, @buchanan2020power shows that the view of the damaging, negative consequences of politics is too narrow. Politics can be both 'functional' and 'dysfunctional'.
:::

## Power and leadership

Other things being equal, political conflict increases with growing interdependence, diversity, and resource scarcity [@pfeffer1992managing].

:::fragment
> Managers who ignore or fail to understand how power and influence work in organizations will find that they and their teams experience difficulty in being effective and ethical in their work. *@hill2003becoming [p. 273]*
:::

:::fragment
Development of competing coalitions and periods of organizational crisis[^coalitions] exacerbate political conflict, while leadership and shared value help to reduce the amount of conflict [@hill2003becoming].
:::

[^coalitions]: Competing coalitions represent what happens when 'organizational seams' (i.e., interfaces or boundaries between distinct units) become battlegrounds — different departments or teams develop their own agendas, priorities, and cultures - creating friction at the seams. Organizational crises can intensify these seam problems as departments protect their interests during uncertainty or resource constraints.

:::fragment
Leaders need to define a vision that aligns and motivates people, creates shared values, and a shared culture—these are critical mechanisms for managing the increased diversity and interdependence in organizations today.

## Personal and positional characteristics

[**Sources of personal power** [@hill2003becoming, p. 276]]{.h4}

:::{.incremental}
- **Expertise**: relevant knowledge and skills
- **Track record**: relevant experience
- **Attractiveness**: attributes that others find appealing and identify with
- **Effort**: expenditure of time and energy
:::

[**Sources of positional power** [@hill2003becoming, p. 276]]{.h4}

:::{.incremental}
- **Formal authority**: position in hierarchy and prescribed responsibilities
- **Relevance**: relationship between task and organizational objectives
- **Centrality**: position in key networks
- **Autonomy**: amount of discretion in a position
- **Visibility**: degree to which performance can be seen by others
:::

## Building key relationships

Companies are increasingly required to engage in cross-organizational work (across levels, functions, geographies) in an effort to improve their capacities to execute and innovate.

:::fragment
Leaders need to build and maintain key relationships to identify changes in the priorities and needs of these groups and prepare their field for new opportunities and threats—**a strong, well-developed network** can provide the kind of big picture information needed in today's world [@brass2012power].
:::

:::fragment
According to @hill2003becoming, effective leadership requires to
:::

:::incremental
- **identify dependencies**^[Dependencies can be analyzed by asking questions such as *On whom am I dependent, and who depends on me?*]
- **take into account the political dynamics** that make for potential sources of conflict^[Political dynamics can be understood by asking, e.g., *What differences exist between me and the people on whom I am dependent? What sources of power do I have to influence this relationship?*]
- **build and maintaining relationships** with those on whom the team is dependent^[Questions like *What can be done to cultivate or repair the relationship?* help to cultivate relationships]
:::

:::large
> It is always better to overestimate rather than underestimate dependencies. *@hill2003becoming*

:::fragment
Understanding *how* to build these relationships brings us to social capital theory — which we will explore in depth in [Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd), where we connect network theory to stakeholder management.

# Conflict dynamics {.headline-only}

## Conflict as inevitable — and potentially productive

:::medium
Conflict is a **natural consequence** of interdependence, diversity, and scarce resources — the same conditions that make organizations productive.
:::

:::fragment
The question is not whether conflict will occur, but whether it will be **functional** or **dysfunctional**.
:::

:::incremental
- **Functional conflict** stimulates creative problem-solving, surfaces hidden assumptions, prevents groupthink, and improves decision quality
- **Dysfunctional conflict** damages relationships, wastes energy, creates anxiety, and undermines collaboration
:::

:::notes
The distinction between functional and dysfunctional conflict connects directly to psychological safety ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)): teams with high psychological safety can engage in vigorous task-related conflict (functional) without it degenerating into personal attacks (dysfunctional). Leaders play a critical role in maintaining this distinction.

Research shows that moderate levels of task conflict are associated with better team performance, while relationship conflict is almost always destructive. The leader's job is to encourage the former while managing the latter.
:::

## Sources of conflict in organizations

Organizational conflict typically arises from:

:::incremental
- **Goal incompatibility** — different units pursue objectives that are in tension (e.g., sales wants customization, operations wants standardization)
- **Resource scarcity** — competing claims on limited budgets, personnel, or attention
- **Role ambiguity** — unclear boundaries of responsibility create overlap and friction
- **Communication breakdowns** — misunderstandings, information asymmetry, and different interpretive frameworks
- **Interdependence** — the more units depend on each other, the more potential friction points exist
:::

:::notes
Notice that these sources of conflict are *structural*, not personal. They arise from how organizations are designed, not from the personalities of the people involved. This is an important diagnostic insight: when conflict arises, leaders should first look at the structural conditions before attributing it to individual behavior.

This connects to our latticework: **systems thinking** helps us see that conflict often emerges from the structure of relationships and incentives, not from "difficult people." Addressing the structure is often more effective than trying to change individuals.
:::

## Thomas-Kilmann conflict styles

The Thomas-Kilmann model [@thomas1974conflict] maps five conflict-handling styles along two dimensions: **assertiveness** (concern for own goals) and **cooperativeness** (concern for others' goals):

:::fragment
|  | **Low cooperativeness** | **High cooperativeness** |
|---|---|---|
| **High assertiveness** | **Competing** — "I win, you lose" | **Collaborating** — "Let's find a win-win" |
| **Medium** | | **Compromising** — "Let's split the difference" |
| **Low assertiveness** | **Avoiding** — "Let's not deal with this" | **Accommodating** — "You win, I'll go along" |
:::

:::notes
The critical insight is that **no single style is universally best** — each is appropriate in certain situations:

- **Competing** is appropriate when quick, decisive action is needed (e.g., emergencies), when unpopular but necessary decisions must be made, or when you need to protect yourself against exploitation.
- **Collaborating** is appropriate when both parties' concerns are too important to compromise, when you need buy-in for implementation, or when the relationship is important long-term.
- **Compromising** is appropriate when goals are moderately important, when time pressure prevents full collaboration, or as a fallback when competing or collaborating fail.
- **Avoiding** is appropriate when the issue is trivial, when emotions are too high for productive discussion, or when others can resolve it more effectively.
- **Accommodating** is appropriate when you realize you are wrong, when the issue matters more to the other party, or when preserving harmony is important.

Effective leaders develop the ability to diagnose which style fits the situation and to flex between styles — another form of the behavioral complexity we discussed in [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd).
:::

## Conflict escalation

The conflict escalation model [@glasl1982process] describes how conflict can spiral through increasingly destructive stages if unmanaged:

:::fragment
::::columns
:::{.column width="32%"}
**Win-Win** (Stages 1–3)

- Hardening of positions
- Debates and polemics
- Actions instead of words
:::

:::{.column width="32%"}
**Win-Lose** (Stages 4–6)

- Coalition building
- Loss of face
- Threats and ultimatums
:::

:::{.column width="32%"}
**Lose-Lose** (Stages 7–9)

- Limited destructive blows
- Fragmentation
- Together into the abyss
:::
::::
:::

:::notes
The escalation model [@glasl1982process] serves as an awareness tool: it helps leaders recognize *where* a conflict currently stands on the escalation ladder and intervene accordingly. The key insight is that the intervention strategies change dramatically depending on the escalation stage:

- In early stages (1–3), the parties can often resolve the conflict themselves with facilitation
- In middle stages (4–6), a third-party mediator or process intervention is usually needed
- In late stages (7–9), only authoritative intervention (hierarchical decision, arbitration) can prevent mutual destruction

For leaders, the practical implication is to intervene early. Every stage of escalation makes resolution harder and more costly. This is why creating conditions for constructive disagreement (psychological safety, clear norms for dissent) is so much more effective than managing full-blown conflicts after the fact.
:::

## The leader's role in conflict

:::incremental
1. **Diagnose the conflict type** — Is this a task conflict (potentially productive) or a relationship conflict (almost always destructive)? Is it structural or interpersonal?
2. **Choose the right intervention** — Match your approach to the conflict stage and type. Not every conflict needs the same treatment.
3. **Create conditions for constructive disagreement** — Build psychological safety ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)) and explicit norms for how the team handles disagreement *before* conflicts escalate.
4. **Model productive conflict behavior** — How the leader handles disagreement sets the tone for the entire team. Engage in conflict openly, respectfully, and with genuine curiosity.
:::

:::notes
The leader's conflict management connects back to multiple course concepts: behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)) enables the leader to flex between conflict styles. Engaging leadership ([Unit 4](../environments/index.qmd)) creates the trust that makes constructive conflict possible. Psychological safety ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)) provides the foundation for voice and dissent. Power and political awareness (this unit) helps the leader navigate the structural forces that generate conflict.

This is the latticework in action: no single model is sufficient for managing conflict. You need multiple lenses — and the judgment to know which one to apply when.

# Leading without formal authority {.headline-only}

## Lateral leadership

:::medium
Most leadership in complex organizations happens **without formal authority** — in cross-functional projects, matrix structures, and influence-based roles.
:::

:::fragment
When you cannot rely on hierarchical power, what works?
:::

:::incremental
- **Building credibility** — expertise and track record are the primary currencies of lateral influence. People follow those they respect, not just those who outrank them.
- **Creating mutual benefit** — identify what the other party needs and find ways to create value for both sides. Influence is a two-way street.
- **Leveraging reciprocity** — the norm of reciprocity is one of the strongest social forces. Build a track record of helping others, and they will be more willing to help you.
- **Coalition tactics** — identify allies, build momentum through early wins, and create a critical mass of support before approaching skeptics.
:::

:::notes
Lateral leadership is increasingly important in the digital age, where cross-functional collaboration, agile teams, and matrix structures are the norm. Many of the most critical leadership challenges — driving digital transformation, launching new products, managing organizational change — require influence across boundaries.

Which sources of power matter most when you lack formal authority? Recall the personal and positional sources from earlier in this unit: **expertise**, **track record**, **centrality** (position in networks), and **relevance** (alignment with organizational priorities) are the most important sources for lateral leaders. Formal authority and hierarchical position matter less.

This is also where social capital — the topic of [Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd) — becomes directly relevant: your network is your primary resource for lateral influence.
:::

## Latticework update {.no-headline .vertical-center}

:::medium
**New models added to your latticework:**

- Conflict styles as situational tools (Thomas-Kilmann)
- Power as relational, not just positional
- Game theory: cooperation vs. competition in iterated interactions
:::

# Q&A {.headline-only .html-hidden .unlisted}

# Homework

Think about a project or initiative in your organization, university, or community:

- **Identify** at least 5 stakeholders affected by or involved in this initiative
- **Assess** each stakeholder's likely **interest** and **influence**
- **Consider** how the stakeholders relate to each other — are there alliances? Tensions?

:::notes
This reflection prepares for [Unit 7](../stakeholder/index.qmd) on stakeholder management. Students should arrive with a concrete stakeholder map they can analyze using salience analysis, the IAP2 engagement spectrum, and coalition-building frameworks.
