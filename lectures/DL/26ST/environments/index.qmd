# Path-goal theory {.headline-only}

## Opening remarks

::: large
Leaders must guide and support their followers along the path to achieving their goals [[@house1996path].]{.smaller}
:::

::: notes

A leader is "one or more people who selects, equips, trains, and influences one or more follower(s) who have diverse gifts, abilities, and skills and focuses the follower(s) to the organization's mission and objectives causing the follower(s) to willingly and enthusiastically expend spiritual, emotional, and physical energy in a concerted coordinated effort **to achieve the organizational mission and objectives**" [@winston2006integrative, p. 8].

Path-goal theory emphasizes that leaders need to **clarify the paths to goals**, remove obstacles, and provide necessary support to help followers reach their objectives efficiently. It highlights the importance of **adapting leadership behaviors** to suit the needs of followers and the situation they are working in. Ultimately, the theory reminds leaders that their primary role is to coach and guide followers towards goal achievement by **selecting behaviors that best fit followers' needs and the working environment.**
:::

## Path-goal clarifying behaviors

The path-goal theory assumes that under conditions [role and task demands that are ambiguous and intrinsically satisfying]{.link-color}, goal-oriented behavior by superiors is helpful and instrumental to task performance.

:::fragment
Leaders who are goal-oriented must clarify the following things:
:::

:::incremental
- subordinates **performance goals**,
- the **means** by which they can effectively carry out tasks,
- the **standards** by which their performance will be judged,
- **expectancies** that others have of them and how to respond appropriately, and
- how to use **rewards and punishment**
in an intelligent manner, contingent on performance.

## Main propositions

:::html-hidden
:::large
[Leaders' behavior complements subordinates' environments and abilities]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and leaders' path-goal clarifying behavior adapts to different situations.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

:::notes
**Leaders' behavior complements subordinates' environments and abilities** — effective leaders engage in behaviors that align with and support their subordinates' environments and abilities. The higher the degree of subordinates self-perceived ability relative to task demands, the less subordinates will view path-goal clarifying behavior as acceptable (motivational) [@house1996path].

**Leaders' path-goal clarifying behavior adapts to different situations** — effective leaders adjust their behavior based on the specific circumstances, tasks (e.g., ambiguity), and characteristics of their followers (e.g., preference for independence). This adaptability ensures that leaders can effectively guide and motivate their subordinates towards achieving goals [@house1996path].

Leadership behavior classes refers to types of actions and conduct that leaders incorporate into their management styles in order to effectively lead their teams, motivate them, and achieve their goals [@house1996path].

Achievement-oriented leader behavior
: sets challenging goals, emphasize excellence, and demonstrate confidence in employees' abilities.

Work facilitation/supportive leader behavior
: plans, schedules, organizes, and coordinates the work; provides mentoring, coaching, counseling, and feedback to assist employees in developing their skills.

Interaction facilitation
: collaboratively removes obstacles that prevent interaction, including dispute resolution, facilitation of communication, and listening to all voices.

Group oriented decision process
: focus on decisions that affect group dynamics and production and on increasing acceptance of such decisions.

Representation and networking
: address the need of leaders to network and actively represent the function of the work unit (e.g., to establish the legitimacy of the work unit)

Value-based leader behavior
: helps establish extraordinary follower commitment by appealing to values and sentiments held dear by subordinates (requires an ideological goal)

Shared leadership
: shares responsibility for leadership to increase unit cohesiveness (functions best in an interdependent environment)

# From path-goal to motivation {.headline-only}

## Bridging the theories

Path-goal theory tells leaders *what to clarify* — goals, means, standards, expectancies, and rewards. But how do you create the conditions where followers are **intrinsically motivated** to walk the path?

:::fragment
:::medium
Self-Determination Theory and engaging leadership address exactly this: the *psychological mechanisms* that turn external guidance into internal drive.
:::
:::

## Expectancy theory

Before we explore intrinsic motivation, a brief look at **expectancy theory** — a complementary lens on motivation.

:::fragment
@vroom1964work proposed that motivation is a function of three beliefs:
:::

:::incremental
- **Expectancy** — "If I try, can I perform?" (effort → performance)
- **Instrumentality** — "If I perform, will I be rewarded?" (performance → outcome)
- **Valence** — "Do I value the reward?" (outcome attractiveness)
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence
:::
:::

:::notes
Expectancy theory connects naturally to path-goal theory: a leader who clarifies goals and removes obstacles is directly increasing followers' *expectancy* beliefs ("I can do this"). A leader who links performance to meaningful outcomes is increasing *instrumentality*. And a leader who understands what followers value can ensure that rewards have high *valence*.

However, expectancy theory primarily explains *extrinsic* motivation — motivation driven by external outcomes. What about the deeper drive that comes from the work itself? This is where Self-Determination Theory enters.
:::

# Self-Determination Theory {.headline-only}

## Three basic psychological needs

Self-Determination Theory [SDT; @deci2000what] proposes that humans have three **basic psychological needs** that, when satisfied, fuel intrinsic motivation and well-being:

:::incremental
- **Autonomy** — the need to feel volitional and self-directed, to experience choice and psychological freedom in one's actions
- **Competence** — the need to feel effective and capable, to master challenges and experience a sense of growth
- **Relatedness** — the need to feel connected to others, to experience belonging, care, and mutual respect
:::

:::notes
SDT distinguishes between different types of motivation along a continuum from *extrinsic* to *intrinsic*:

- **External regulation** — behavior driven by external rewards or punishments ("I do it because I'll be paid")
- **Introjected regulation** — behavior driven by internal pressure like guilt or ego ("I do it because I'd feel bad if I didn't")
- **Identified regulation** — behavior driven by personal importance ("I do it because it matters to me")
- **Intrinsic motivation** — behavior driven by inherent interest and enjoyment ("I do it because I find it fascinating")

As motivation moves along this continuum from external to intrinsic, it becomes more autonomous, more sustained, and more associated with well-being and performance. Leaders play a critical role in creating environments that support this internalization process.
:::

## SDT in the workplace

:::medium
Why does SDT matter for leaders?
:::

:::fragment
::::columns
:::{.column width="48%"}
**When needs are satisfied:**

- Greater intrinsic motivation
- Higher quality performance
- More creativity and innovation
- Stronger well-being and resilience
- Lower turnover intention

:::

:::{.column width="48%"}
**When needs are thwarted:**

- Reliance on external incentives
- Compliance without commitment
- Disengagement and burnout
- Higher absenteeism and turnover
- Resistance to change

:::
::::
:::

:::notes
Consider common leadership practices through the SDT lens:

- **Micromanagement** thwarts autonomy — when every decision must be approved, followers lose the sense of psychological freedom that fuels intrinsic motivation.
- **Unchallenging work** thwarts competence — when tasks are trivial or repetitive, followers cannot experience the mastery that drives engagement.
- **Isolation and competition** thwart relatedness — when team members are pitted against each other or work in silos, the sense of belonging erodes.

Conversely, leaders who delegate meaningful responsibility (autonomy), provide stretch assignments with support (competence), and build genuine team connections (relatedness) create the conditions for sustained high performance.
:::

## From SDT to engaging leadership

SDT provides the **motivational logic**; engaging leadership provides the **leadership operationalization**.

:::fragment
:::medium
How do leaders translate SDT's three needs into concrete behaviors? This is precisely what engaging leadership theory addresses.
:::

# Engaging leadership {.headline-only}

------

:::large
> One of the principal responsibilities of leaders is to motivate their followers so that they will perform well. *@schaufeli2021engaging*
:::

:::fragment
::: {.html-hidden}
Engaged employees invest highly in their job because they enjoy it,\
nevertheless they know when to stop [@schaufeli2021engaging].
:::
:::

## Work engagement

:::fragment
Work engagement refers to "a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterized by *vigor*, *dedication*, and *absorption*" [@schaufeli2002measurement, p. 74]
:::

:::{.incremental}
- **Vigor** refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one's work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties.
- **Dedication** refers to being strongly involved in one's work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.
- **Absorption** refers to being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work.
:::

:::fragment
Work engagement differs from **work addiction**. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don't, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.
:::

:::{.notes}
@taris2014beauty argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation. The former are attracted by work because it is fun, whereas the latter are driven to work in an attempt to avoid the negative thoughts and feelings that are associated with not working.
:::

## Effects of work engagement

Research shows that work engagement is good for employees as well as for the organizations they work for [see e.g., @schaufeli2013engagement].

:::{.incremental}
- Engaged employees **suffer less from all kinds of stress complaints** (e.g., depression).
- They run a **lower risk of cardiovascular disease** and, hence, they show **lower sickness absenteeism**.
- Engaged employees also feel strongly committed to their organization and therefore show **lower turnover intentions**.
- They often show a **growth mindset** (e.g., like to learn and develop themselves, take personal initiative, and are innovative).
- Engaged employees **perform better** (e.g., make fewer mistakes).
:::

## Engaging leadership

**Engaging leadership** is defined as leadership behavior that facilitates, strengthens, connects and inspires employees in order to increase their work engagement [@schaufeli2021engaging, p. 4]

:::incremental
- **Facilitating** team-members satisfies the need for *autonomy* by giving them the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.
- **Strengthening**  team-members satisfies the need for *competence*, e.g., by delegating tasks and responsibilities, giving them challenging jobs and stimulating their talents.
- **Connecting** team-members satisfies the need for *relatedness*, e.g., by encouraging collaboration and creating a good team spirit.
- **Inspiring** team-members satisfies the need for *meaning*, e.g., by enthusing them about a particular vision, mission, idea or plan and recognising their personal contribution to the overall goal of the team or organisation.
:::

:::fragment
:::smaller
Engaging leadership builds on the principles of **Self-determination Theory (SDT)** [@deci2008self], which focuses on three core psychological needs that drive human motivation: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these needs are satisfied, people experience greater intrinsic motivation and well-being.
:::
:::

## Effects of engaging leadership

Engaging leadership is expected to lead to the satisfaction of **basic psychological needs**.

:::fragment
Satisfying basic psychological needs subsequently leads to
:::

:::incremental
- strengthened personal **job resources** (e.g., autonomy, task variety, role clarity, social support),
- an increased effect of HR policies (e.g., regarding training and education) on well-being,
- an increase in **work engagement** of employees,
- decrease of **boredom**, and
- increase in **individual performance** and **team performance**.
:::

## Disengaging leadership

According to @schaufeli2021engaging, engaging leadership can be contrasted with its opposite **disengaging leadership**.

:::fragment
Disengaging leadership is characterized by:
:::

:::large
[coercive behavior, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[eroding behavior,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[isolating behavior,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and demotivating behavior.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

:::notes
- **Coercive behavior**, which refers to authoritarian behaviour that restricts and controls employees.
- **Eroding behavior** that aims to hinder staff members' professional development and diminish their sense of competence
- **Isolating behavior** that disconnects staff from the rest of the team and pits them against each other
- **Demotivating behavior** that aims to create the impression that employees' work is meaningless and that their work does not contribute to anything important.
:::

:::fragment
People that exhibit these behaviors thwart the basic needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning.
