The session is designed as a flipped classroom — students have pre-read @house1996path and answered four guiding questions about the essence of path-goal theory, leader behavior classes, personal experiences, and empirical evidence.

- Front-load the pre-reading payoff in the activation and Block 1 so students see value in having prepared.
- The engaging vs. disengaging leadership exercise in Block 3 is the most interactive segment.
- Keep the SDT mini-lecture focused — students learn it best through the engaging leadership application.
:::

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. **Explain** Path-Goal Theory and how leaders clarify the path to follower goal achievement
2. **Compare** extrinsic and intrinsic motivation using Self-Determination Theory's need framework
3. **Describe** engaging leadership and how it operationalises SDT's basic psychological needs
4. **Contrast** engaging and disengaging leadership and their effects on work engagement
:::

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Latticework check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Which mental models from previous units might help us think about motivation?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Plenary warm-up (5 min).**

Let 2–3 students respond briefly. Expected connections:

- **Incentive structures** — how do rewards and punishments shape follower behavior?
- **Feedback loops** — how does engagement create performance which reinforces engagement?
- **Behavioral complexity** from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd) — leaders must adapt their motivational approach to the situation
- **CVF** — the *collaborate* quadrant is fundamentally about motivating through people

Land on: today we move from *what* leaders do (paradoxes, frameworks) to *why* it works (motivational mechanisms).
:::

## Individual reflection {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Write down your findings.
:::

1. **The essence** of path-goal theory in one sentence.
2. **One leader behavior class** from @house1996path that you have experienced personally.

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Individual writing (4 min).**

This activates the pre-reading. Students who did the reading should be able to articulate that path-goal theory is about leaders adapting their behavior to complement follower abilities and environmental conditions.

The second question connects theory to lived experience — this will fuel the pair share.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Turn to your neighbor\
and compare your findings.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

Which leader behavior class resonated most? Why?

:::notes
**Pair share (4 min).**

Walk around and listen. Note which behavior classes come up most — this tells you what to emphasize in Block 1. Common mentions: achievement-oriented, supportive, work facilitation.

No plenary report-out; energy flows into Block 1.
:::

# Path-goal theory {.headline-only}

## Core proposition

::: large
Leaders must guide and support their followers along the path to achieving their goals [[@house1996path].]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture start (3 min).**

Path-goal theory emphasizes that leaders need to clarify paths to goals, remove obstacles, and provide necessary support. The leader's primary role is to coach and guide followers toward goal achievement by selecting behaviors that best fit followers' needs and the working environment.

Connect to [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd): situational leadership told us to match style to follower readiness. Path-goal theory goes further — it specifies *which* behaviors work *when* and *why* (through motivational mechanisms).
:::

## Path-goal clarifying behaviors

The theory assumes that under conditions of [ambiguous and intrinsically satisfying role and task demands]{.link-color}, goal-oriented behavior by superiors is helpful and instrumental to task performance.

:::fragment
Leaders who are goal-oriented must clarify:
:::

:::incremental
- Subordinates' **performance goals**
- The **means** by which they can effectively carry out tasks
- The **standards** by which their performance will be judged
- **Expectancies** that others have of them
- How to use **rewards and punishment** contingent on performance
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each clarifying behavior with a concrete example. The key insight: path-goal theory is fundamentally about *reducing uncertainty* for followers. When people know what is expected, how to get there, and what the payoff is, they are more motivated and effective.

Probe: "Which of these clarifying behaviors is most often neglected by leaders you've observed?" This connects to the reading.
:::

## Leader behavior classes {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Which behavior class fits which situation?
:::

In groups of 3–4, take the seven behavior classes from @house1996path and:

1. **Match** each behavior class to a concrete leadership scenario.
2. **Identify** the follower and environmental conditions that make each behavior effective.
3. **Connect** at least two behavior classes to CVF quadrants from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd).

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min group work, 5 min plenary).**

The seven classes: achievement-oriented, work facilitation/supportive, interaction facilitation, group-oriented decision process, representation and networking, value-based, shared leadership.

Walk around and push groups to be specific about situations. Good probing:
- "When would achievement-oriented behavior *backfire*?"
- "Which behavior class maps to the *collaborate* quadrant? The *compete* quadrant?"
- "What happens when a leader uses the wrong behavior class for the situation?"

In plenary, have 2–3 groups share their CVF connections. This builds the bridge: path-goal theory operationalizes behavioral complexity — different situations require different leader behaviors.

Transition: "Path-goal theory tells leaders *what* to clarify. But how do you create the conditions where followers are *intrinsically* motivated to walk the path?"
:::

## Main propositions

:::medium
Leaders' behavior **complements** subordinates' environments and abilities
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
and leaders' path-goal clarifying behavior **adapts** to different situations.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Two key propositions:

1. Effective leaders engage in behaviors that align with and support their subordinates' environments and abilities. The higher subordinates' self-perceived ability, the less they view path-goal clarifying behavior as acceptable.
2. Effective leaders adjust their behavior based on circumstances, tasks (e.g., ambiguity), and follower characteristics (e.g., preference for independence).

Transition: "Path-goal theory focuses on how leaders *clarify* the path. But what about the deeper question: what makes people *want* to walk the path in the first place?"
:::

# From path-goal to motivation {.headline-only}

## Bridging the theories

Path-goal theory tells leaders *what to clarify* — goals, means, standards, expectancies, and rewards. But how do you create the conditions where followers are **intrinsically motivated**?

:::fragment
:::medium
Self-Determination Theory and engaging leadership address exactly this: the *psychological mechanisms* that turn external guidance into internal drive.
:::
:::

:::notes
**Framing (2 min).**

This bridge is important. Path-goal theory is largely about *extrinsic* motivation — clarifying what followers get for performing. SDT shifts the focus to *intrinsic* motivation — creating conditions where followers perform because the work itself is meaningful.
:::

## Expectancy theory

@vroom1964work proposed that motivation is a function of three beliefs:

:::incremental
- **Expectancy** — "If I try, can I perform?" (effort → performance)
- **Instrumentality** — "If I perform, will I be rewarded?" (performance → outcome)
- **Valence** — "Do I value the reward?" (outcome attractiveness)
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Connect naturally to path-goal theory: a leader who clarifies goals and removes obstacles increases *expectancy*. A leader who links performance to outcomes increases *instrumentality*. A leader who understands what followers value ensures high *valence*.

However, expectancy theory primarily explains *extrinsic* motivation. What about the deeper drive from the work itself? Transition to SDT.
:::

## Three basic psychological needs

Self-Determination Theory [SDT; @deci2000what] proposes three **basic psychological needs** that fuel intrinsic motivation:

:::incremental
- **Autonomy** — the need to feel volitional and self-directed
- **Competence** — the need to feel effective and capable, to master challenges
- **Relatedness** — the need to feel connected to others, to experience belonging
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

SDT distinguishes motivation along a continuum from external regulation ("I do it because I'll be paid") through identified regulation ("I do it because it matters to me") to intrinsic motivation ("I do it because I find it fascinating").

As motivation moves from external to intrinsic, it becomes more autonomous, more sustained, and more associated with well-being and performance. Leaders play a critical role in creating environments that support this internalization process.
:::

## SDT in practice {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think about your current study or work environment.
:::

1. Which of the three needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) is **best satisfied**?
2. Which is **most thwarted**?
3. What does this mean for your **motivation and engagement**?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Think-Pair-Share (7 min total: 3 min individual, 2 min pairs, 2 min plenary).**

This makes SDT personal and concrete. Expected patterns: students often identify competence as well-satisfied (they are learning) but autonomy as thwarted (rigid curricula, prescribed assignments).

Probe: "What would a leader do to address the thwarted need?" This sets up engaging leadership perfectly.

Transition: "SDT provides the *motivational logic*. Engaging leadership tells us *what leaders actually do* to satisfy these needs."
:::

# Engaging leadership {.headline-only}

## What is engaging leadership?

:::large
> One of the principal responsibilities of leaders is to motivate their followers so that they will perform well. *@schaufeli2021engaging*
:::

:::fragment
**Engaging leadership** is leadership behavior that facilitates, strengthens, connects and inspires employees to increase their work engagement [@schaufeli2021engaging, p. 4].
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture start (3 min).**

Engaging leadership operationalizes SDT for the leadership context. It answers: "If I'm a leader who wants to satisfy my team's basic psychological needs, what exactly should I *do*?"
:::

## Four engaging behaviors

:::incremental
- **Facilitating** satisfies the need for *autonomy* — giving team members the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.
- **Strengthening** satisfies the need for *competence* — delegating tasks, giving challenging jobs, stimulating talents.
- **Connecting** satisfies the need for *relatedness* — encouraging collaboration and creating good team spirit.
- **Inspiring** satisfies the need for *meaning* — enthusing team members about a vision and recognizing their contribution.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each behavior with a concrete example from a workplace context. Emphasize the SDT connection: each engaging behavior maps to a specific psychological need.

Key point: engaging leadership builds on SDT [@deci2008self]. When these needs are satisfied, people experience greater intrinsic motivation and well-being.
:::

## Work engagement

Work engagement refers to "a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind characterized by *vigor*, *dedication*, and *absorption*" [@schaufeli2002measurement, p. 74].

:::incremental
- **Vigor** — high energy and mental resilience, willingness to invest effort, persistence in the face of difficulties.
- **Dedication** — being strongly involved, experiencing significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.
- **Absorption** — being fully concentrated and happily engrossed, time passes quickly.
:::

:::fragment
Work engagement differs from **work addiction**: engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation; workaholics have a negative (avoidance) motivation [@taris2014beauty].
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The distinction between engagement and workaholism is important. Engaged employees enjoy their work and know when to stop. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work. The former are attracted by work because it is fun; the latter are driven to work to avoid negative feelings associated with not working.
:::

## Engaging vs. disengaging {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Analyse real leadership scenarios.
:::

For each scenario, diagnose:

1. Is the leader behavior **engaging** or **disengaging**?
2. Which **specific behavior** is at play (facilitating, strengthening, connecting, inspiring — or coercive, eroding, isolating, demotivating)?
3. Which **psychological need** is being satisfied or thwarted?
4. What would the **opposite** approach look like?

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min group work, 5 min plenary).**

Provide 4–5 brief scenarios on cards or slides (prepare in advance). Example scenarios:

1. "A manager checks in daily with each team member to ask how she can remove obstacles to their work." (Facilitating → autonomy)
2. "A team lead assigns only routine tasks to junior members, saving interesting projects for senior staff." (Eroding → thwarting competence)
3. "A director celebrates team successes publicly but handles failures privately with individuals." (Connecting + strengthening)
4. "A manager uses monitoring software to track employee productivity every 15 minutes." (Coercive → thwarting autonomy)
5. "A leader rotates meeting facilitation so every team member leads at least one meeting per quarter." (Strengthening → competence)

Walk around and push groups to identify the specific SDT need. In plenary, build the pattern: engaging behaviors satisfy needs; disengaging behaviors systematically thwart them.
:::

## Disengaging leadership

Disengaging leadership is characterized by:

:::incremental
- **Coercive behavior** — authoritarian behavior that restricts and controls employees
- **Eroding behavior** — hindering professional development and diminishing competence
- **Isolating behavior** — disconnecting staff from the team and pitting them against each other
- **Demotivating behavior** — creating the impression that employees' work is meaningless
:::

:::fragment
People who exhibit these behaviors thwart the basic needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This is the dark mirror of engaging leadership. Each disengaging behavior maps to a specific SDT need being thwarted: coercive → autonomy, eroding → competence, isolating → relatedness, demotivating → meaning.
:::

## Digital × disengaging leadership {.discussion-slide}

:::large
The digital × disengaging leadership
:::

1. How might "the digital" promote disengaging leadership, albeit unnoticed?
2. How can leaders prevent those they lead from disengaging?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group discussion (12 min total: 8 min discussion, 4 min plenary).**

Steer the conversation toward examples:

- **Surveillance software** that thwarts autonomy (coercive)
- **Algorithmic task assignment** that erodes competence (eroding)
- **Remote work isolation** that undermines relatedness (isolating)
- **Automated feedback** that strips meaning from work (demotivating)

Push groups to also propose counter-strategies using the engaging leadership framework:
- How do you *facilitate* in a digital environment?
- How do you *connect* distributed team members?
- How do you *strengthen* when you can't observe performance directly?

This bridges to virtual team leadership in Unit 5.

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Synthesis

:::medium
> Leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that [complement]{.link-color} subordinate's environments and abilities in a manner that [compensates]{.link-color} for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate [satisfaction]{.link-color} and individual and work unit [performance.]{.link-color} *@house1996path [p. 348]*
:::

:::notes
**Plenary synthesis (3 min).**

Connect the full arc: path-goal theory → expectancy theory → SDT → engaging leadership. Each framework adds a layer of understanding about how leaders create conditions for high performance.

The key insight: effective leadership is not about a single behavior but about reading the situation and selecting the right approach. This is behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)) applied to motivation.
:::

## Latticework update

:::medium
**Which new models have you added to your latticework?**
:::

:::fragment
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation continuum
- Path-goal contingency thinking
- Feedback loops: engagement → performance → engagement
:::

:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).**

Collect these on the board alongside earlier models. Ask: "How do these connect to what we already had?"

Expected connections:
- Behavioral complexity (Unit 3) now includes a motivational dimension — different situations require different motivational approaches.
- Trait paradoxes (Unit 2) connect to engaging/disengaging — the same leader trait can produce engaging or disengaging behavior depending on context.
- CVF quadrants each imply different motivational strategies.

:::notes
Let this sit. Then transition to homework.

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Read @nahapiet1998social and answer the following questions:

:::incremental
- What is social capital?
- What advantages does social capital bring?
- How does social capital relate to leadership?
:::

:::notes
This reading prepares for Unit 7 on stakeholder management and coalition building, where social capital theory becomes the theoretical backbone for understanding how leaders build and leverage networks.

"As you read, think about which types of relationships — strong or weak ties — are most valuable for leaders. We will return to this later in the course."
