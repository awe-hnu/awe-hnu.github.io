# Introduction {.headline-only}

## Today's session

:::medium
- Concept mapping warm-up [15 min]{.smaller}
- Social capital theory [30 min]{.smaller}
- Stakeholder identification & salience [25 min]{.smaller}
- [Break]{.highlight}
- Engagement spectrum & coalition building [30 min]{.smaller}
- Integrated case exercise [25 min]{.smaller}
- Reflection & closing [10 min]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
135 minutes total.

The session builds on two preparation threads:
1. The pre-reading of @nahapiet1998social (assigned in Unit 4 homework) — students should understand the basic concept of social capital.
2. The homework from Unit 6: students identified stakeholders for a real project and assessed their interest and influence.

- The activation uses a **collaborative concept map** — groups build visual stakeholder maps on flip charts, creating a shared reference for the session.
- The social capital exercise uses **speed consulting** — rotating pairs give each other 3-minute advice bursts on their stakeholder challenges.
- The stakeholder mapping exercise uses a **jigsaw** — each group becomes expert on one salience type, then mixed groups apply the full framework.
- The integrated case uses a **pitch competition** — groups present their strategies to a simulated "board."
:::

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. Explain social capital theory and distinguish structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions.
2. Apply stakeholder salience analysis (power, legitimacy, urgency) to identify and prioritise stakeholders.
3. Select appropriate engagement levels using the IAP2 spectrum based on stakeholder attributes.
4. Design coalition-building strategies using network analysis and second-order thinking.

# Warm-up {.headline-only}

## Stakeholder map check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Review your stakeholder homework.
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Collaborative concept mapping — Phase 1: Mapping (3 min).**

Provide each table (groups of 4–5) with a large flip chart and colored markers. Task: "Pool your homework stakeholder maps. Create ONE visual concept map that shows all stakeholders your group identified, grouped by type. Draw lines to show relationships. Use different colors for allies, neutrals, and opponents." This forces immediate collaboration and produces a visual artifact that the group will refine throughout the session.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Continue building your group's concept map.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

Add arrows for influence direction. Mark stakeholders with high/low interest using symbols (★/○).

:::notes
**Collaborative concept mapping — Phase 2: Enriching (4 min).**

Groups add structure to their maps: arrows for influence direction, symbols for interest level, dotted lines for weak ties and solid lines for strong ties. Walk around and prompt: "Are you missing any indirect stakeholders? Who connects your stakeholders to each other?"

The visual nature of concept mapping makes the subjective nature of stakeholder analysis immediately visible — different group members will disagree about arrow directions and interest levels. This IS the learning.
:::

## Plenary debrief {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What was the hardest part of stakeholder identification? What surprised you?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Collaborative concept mapping — Phase 3: Gallery + Debrief (5 min).**

Hang the concept maps on the wall. Quick gallery walk (2 min): students view other groups' maps. Then plenary (3 min): "What did other groups include that yours missed? Where do the maps disagree?"

Preview: "Your concept maps are intuitive stakeholder analyses. Today we'll add systematic frameworks — social capital theory, salience analysis, engagement spectrums — to refine what you just built. By session's end, you'll upgrade your maps."

Connect: "In [Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd), we discussed power, politics, and lateral influence. Today's frameworks give you the tools to *map* those dynamics systematically."
:::

# Social capital theory {.headline-only}

## What is social capital? {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Based on your reading of @nahapiet1998social, how would you define social capital?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Quick plenary (3 min).**

Let 2–3 students offer definitions. Use their responses to transition to the formal definitions. Expected elements: networks, relationships, resources, trust.
:::

## Key definitions

> ... the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or a social unit. *@nahapiet1998social [p. 243]*

:::fragment
> ... features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefits *@putnam1993prosperous [p. 67]*
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The definitions share two core elements: (1) the **structure of social relations** (networks) and (2) social capital as **a resource for action**. Connect to the reading: @nahapiet1998social conceive social capital as comprising both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network.
:::

## Strong vs. weak ties

@coleman1988social argues that **strong ties** (cohesion) are the source of social capital:

:::incremental
- Cohesion facilitates social norms, trust, and sanctions
- Strong ties enable coordination and knowledge exchange (*bonding*)
:::

:::fragment
@burt2018structural posits that social capital emerges from **structural holes** — opportunities to bridge disconnected groups (*weak ties*):
:::

:::incremental
- Structural holes provide access to diverse perspectives and resources
- Social capital emerges from structurally favorable positions (*bridging*)
:::

:::fragment
This maps directly onto stakeholder engagement: **bonding** ties for core allies, **bridging** ties for new stakeholder access.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The strong/weak tie distinction is crucial for stakeholder management:
- Strong ties (bonding) are reliable but provide redundant information — your close allies tend to know what you know.
- Weak ties (bridging) are less reliable but provide access to new information and diverse perspectives — they connect you to different stakeholder groups.

Effective stakeholder managers need both: strong ties to maintain their core coalition, and weak ties to reach new stakeholder groups and detect emerging issues early.
:::

## Three dimensions of social capital

:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through the three dimensions with examples:

![Social capital in the creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social, p. 251]](images/nahapiet.svg){#fig-nahapiet}

- **Structural dimension**: the pattern of connections — *who* is connected to *whom*? Network density, centrality, structural holes.
- **Relational dimension**: the quality of connections — trust, norms, identification, obligations. Two people can have the same network position but very different relational capital.
- **Cognitive dimension**: shared understanding — shared language, codes, narratives. Without cognitive capital, even well-connected, trusting relationships may fail to produce value because parties cannot communicate effectively.

Connect to stakeholder management: successful engagement requires attention to all three dimensions. You need network access (structural), trust and respect (relational), and shared understanding (cognitive).
:::

## Social capital application exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Map the social capital in your stakeholder network.
:::

Return to the stakeholder map from your homework. For your most important stakeholder relationship:

1. **Structural**: How are you connected? Direct or through intermediaries?
2. **Relational**: What is the quality of the relationship? Trust level?
3. **Cognitive**: Do you share a common language and frame of reference?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Speed consulting (12 min total: 9 min rotation, 3 min plenary).**

Pairs form. Person A is the "client" and presents their most important stakeholder relationship (1.5 min). Person B is the "consultant" and diagnoses the social capital gaps using the three dimensions (1.5 min). Then swap roles. After 3 minutes, signal: "Switch partners!" Run 3 rounds total — each student consults for 3 different people.

The speed format forces concise diagnosis and exposes students to diverse stakeholder situations. The consultant role builds analytical confidence.

Plenary (3 min): "What was the most common social capital gap you diagnosed?" Common answer: cognitive dimension — people underestimate how much shared understanding matters.

Transition: "Social capital tells us *why* relationships matter. Now let's build tools for systematically identifying and prioritizing stakeholders."
:::

# Stakeholder identification & salience {.headline-only}

## Who is a stakeholder?

:::medium
> A stakeholder is any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives. *@freeman1984strategic [p. 46]*
:::

:::fragment
This definition is deliberately broad — it forces leaders to look beyond the obvious (shareholders, employees, customers) to include all groups that have a stake in the organization's actions and outcomes.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The stakeholder concept challenges shareholder primacy. For digital leaders, the stakeholder landscape is particularly complex: digital transformation affects employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, communities, and entire industries — often in unpredictable ways.

Connect to [Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd): stakeholders are the people with whom you must build power relationships and manage potential conflicts.
:::

## Stakeholder salience

Not all stakeholders are equally important at any given time. @mitchell1997toward proposed the **stakeholder salience model**:

:::incremental
- **Power** — the stakeholder's ability to influence the organization (coercive, utilitarian, or normative)
- **Legitimacy** — the perceived appropriateness of the stakeholder's claim or relationship
- **Urgency** — the degree to which the stakeholder's claim demands immediate attention
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The three attributes combine to create seven stakeholder types:

1. **Dormant** (power only) — potential threat if activated
2. **Discretionary** (legitimacy only) — often recipients of philanthropy
3. **Demanding** (urgency only) — can be disruptive but easily dismissed
4. **Dominant** (power + legitimacy) — addressed by formal governance
5. **Dangerous** (power + urgency) — may resort to coercive tactics
6. **Dependent** (legitimacy + urgency) — depend on others to act on their behalf
7. **Definitive** (all three) — demand and deserve immediate attention

The model is dynamic: salience changes over time. A dormant stakeholder can become definitive if they gain legitimacy and urgency.
:::

## Interest-influence matrix

A complementary tool: map stakeholders on **interest** × **influence**:

:::fragment
|  | **Low influence** | **High influence** |
|---|---|---|
| **High interest** | **Keep informed** — regular updates | **Manage closely** — active engagement |
| **Low interest** | **Monitor** — minimal effort | **Keep satisfied** — address concerns proactively |
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The matrix is widely used because of its simplicity. But it has limitations: it's static, doesn't capture network dynamics, and can oversimplify.

Social capital theory enriches the picture: network analysis reveals *how* stakeholders are connected, showing indirect influence paths that the 2×2 matrix misses. A stakeholder with low direct influence but high centrality may be critical for building coalitions.
:::

## Stakeholder mapping exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Apply salience analysis to a digital transformation scenario.
:::

**Scenario:** Your company is implementing AI-driven customer service in a bank.

1. **Identify** at least 6 stakeholders
2. **Assess** each stakeholder's power, legitimacy, and urgency
3. **Classify** each using the salience model (dormant, discretionary, demanding, dominant, dangerous, dependent, or definitive)
4. **Map** them on the interest-influence matrix

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Jigsaw (15 min total: 7 min expert groups, 5 min mixed groups, 3 min plenary).**

Phase 1 — Expert groups (7 min): Divide into 3 groups. Each becomes an expert on ONE salience attribute:
- Group A: **Power** — identify which stakeholders in the bank scenario have coercive, utilitarian, or normative power.
- Group B: **Legitimacy** — assess which stakeholders have legitimate claims and why.
- Group C: **Urgency** — determine which stakeholders' claims demand immediate attention.

Phase 2 — Mixed groups (5 min): Regroup so each new group has one expert from A, B, and C. Together, they classify each stakeholder using the full salience model (dormant, discretionary, demanding, dominant, dangerous, dependent, definitive).

Plenary (3 min): "Which stakeholders did mixed groups classify differently? Why?" Push: "Which stakeholder is most likely to be overlooked?" Often: employees whose jobs are threatened.

Transition: "Now that we know *who* the stakeholders are and *how important* they are, the question is: *how deeply* should we engage each one?"
:::

# Engagement spectrum & coalition building {.headline-only}

## IAP2 engagement spectrum

The International Association for Public Participation defines five levels of stakeholder engagement:

:::fragment
| Level | Promise to stakeholders | Leader behavior |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Inform** | "We will keep you informed" | One-way communication |
| **Consult** | "We will listen to you" | Two-way feedback |
| **Involve** | "We will work with you" | Active participation |
| **Collaborate** | "We will partner with you" | Shared decision-making |
| **Empower** | "We will implement what you decide" | Delegation of authority |
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The spectrum helps leaders make deliberate choices about engagement depth. Key insight: the engagement level should match stakeholder salience:

- **Definitive stakeholders** → collaborate or empower
- **Dominant stakeholders** → involve or collaborate
- **Dependent stakeholders** → consult or involve
- **Dormant/discretionary stakeholders** → inform

The challenge: when stakeholders *expect* a higher level than you provide. A labor union that expects collaboration but is only consulted will feel disrespected. Getting this calibration right requires stakeholder empathy — seeing the situation from each stakeholder's perspective.

Connect to [Unit 4](../motivation/index.qmd): engaging leadership principles apply to stakeholder engagement too. Facilitating, connecting, and strengthening apply not just to teams but to entire stakeholder relationships.
:::

## Coalitions as change mechanism

:::medium
A coalition is a temporary alliance of stakeholders who share a common interest and pool resources to achieve it.
:::

:::fragment
Key principles of coalition building:
:::

:::incremental
- **Identify potential allies and blockers** using the stakeholder map
- **Start with easy wins** — build momentum by engaging predisposed supporters first
- **Sequence carefully** — each new ally makes the next one easier to recruit
- **Use reciprocity as currency** — coalitions run on mutual benefit (social capital's relational dimension)
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Coalition building is where stakeholder management, social capital theory, and political navigation ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) converge:
- The stakeholder map tells you *who* to engage
- Social capital theory tells you *through whom* to reach them
- Political navigation tells you *how* to exercise influence

Effective coalition builders think several moves ahead — second-order thinking applied to political strategy. "If I engage stakeholder A first, how will that affect my ability to engage stakeholder B?"
:::

## Stakeholder network analysis

Static stakeholder maps miss the **network dynamics** that often determine outcomes.

:::fragment
:::medium
Key question: "Who connects whom? Where are the bridges and bottlenecks?"
:::
:::

:::incremental
- **Centrality** — which stakeholders are most connected? They are likely the most influential
- **Structural holes** — where are the gaps between groups? Bridging these creates influence opportunities
- **Clusters** — which stakeholders form tight-knit groups? These may act as blocks in coalition dynamics
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Network analysis connects social capital theory directly to practical action:
- Identify a **structural hole** → position yourself as a bridge
- Identify a **central connector** → leverage their network to amplify your message
- Identify **dense clusters** of opposition → develop targeted strategies for each

This is the practical payoff of social capital theory: it provides not just a theoretical framework but a diagnostic tool for real stakeholder challenges.
:::

## Integrated case exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Design a complete stakeholder engagement strategy.
:::

**Scenario:** Your company is launching a **digital transformation initiative** — migrating core business processes to a cloud-based platform. You are the project leader.

1. **Identify** stakeholders (aim for at least 8)
2. **Map** interest × influence for each stakeholder
3. **Propose** engagement strategies per stakeholder group (using IAP2 spectrum)
4. **Design** a coalition-building sequence — who do you engage first? Through whom?

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Pitch competition (15 min total: 8 min prep, 5 min pitches, 2 min judging).**

Each group becomes a "consulting firm" hired to advise the project leader. They prepare a 90-second pitch to the "board" (played by 2–3 volunteer students or you) that covers:
1. Top 5 stakeholders and their salience classification
2. Engagement strategy for each (using IAP2 spectrum)
3. Coalition-building sequence with rationale

Prep (8 min): Groups develop their pitch — encourage visual aids (they can use their concept maps from the activation, now enriched). Pitches (5 min): 3–4 groups present (90 sec each, strictly timed). Board judges (2 min): The "board" asks one tough question per group and votes for the most convincing strategy.

Push the board to ask: "Why *involve* the works council rather than *collaborate*? What happens if you only *inform* end users?"

The competitive format creates accountability and energy. The "board" perspective forces audience-aware communication — a preview of Unit 9 (storytelling).
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Latticework update

:::medium
**Which new models have you added to your latticework?**
:::

:::fragment
- Stakeholder salience (power × legitimacy × urgency)
- Engagement spectrum as situational tool
- Coalition logic and second-order stakeholder effects
:::

:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).**

Collect on the board alongside earlier models. Ask: "How do these connect to what we already had?"

Expected connections:
- Lateral leadership ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) now has a systematic stakeholder framework.
- Behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): different stakeholders require different engagement approaches — the same leader must adapt.
- Psychological safety ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)): trust (relational social capital) is the foundation for all stakeholder engagement.
- Network effects from systems thinking: stakeholder relationships create reinforcing loops.
:::

## Closing quote {.discussion-slide}

:::large
The core intuition guiding social capital research is that the goodwill that others have toward us is a valuable resource.\
[@adler2002social]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
Let this sit. Then transition to homework.
:::

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Reflect on your own cultural background and how it shapes your leadership assumptions:

:::incremental
- What **cultural values** (e.g., from Hofstede's dimensions) are most prominent in your context?
- Have you experienced a situation where **cultural differences** affected leadership or teamwork?
- What **ethical principles** guide your approach to leadership?
:::

:::notes
This reflection prepares for [Unit 8](../context/index.qmd) on cross-cultural leadership, ethical frameworks, and the integration of all course concepts. Students should arrive with a concrete cultural experience they can analyze.

"As you reflect, think about how your cultural background shapes what you expect from leaders — and what leaders you aspire to be."
