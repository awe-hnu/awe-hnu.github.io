# Warm-up {.headline-only}

## The Invisible 3 {.discussion-slide}

:::large
The HNU is launching a "Digital Leadership" Master’s.
:::

Group in pairs and identify 3 **"shadow" stakeholders** who are not the Students or the Dean.

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
In their pairs, students brainstorm who actually makes this happen or can stop it.
:::

## Power vs. legitimacy {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Pick one *shadow stakeholder*.
:::

Debate in your group:\
Do they have the power to **veto** the program, or just the right to **complain** about it?

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

## Plenary debrief {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Who is the *dormant giant*\
in this case?
:::

Who identified someone with no interest now, but who will be furious if we get it wrong?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
You’ve just done a 'gut-level' stakeholder map. 
Today we’ll look at **Salience Theory** to see why the Finance Office often wins even when the Professors have the 'better' ideas, and how **Coalition Building** can help the Professors win back that influence.
:::

# Social capital theory {.headline-only}

## What is social capital? {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Based on your reading of @nahapiet1998social, how would you define social capital?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Quick plenary (3 min).**

Let 2–3 students offer definitions. Use their responses to transition to the formal definitions. Expected elements: networks, relationships, resources, trust.
:::

## Key definitions

> ... the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or a social unit. *@nahapiet1998social [p. 243]*

:::fragment
> ... features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefits *@putnam1993prosperous [p. 67]*
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The definitions share two core elements: (1) the **structure of social relations** (networks) and (2) social capital as **a resource for action**. Connect to the reading: @nahapiet1998social conceive social capital as comprising both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network.
:::

## Strong vs. weak ties

@coleman1988social argues that **strong ties** (cohesion) are the source of social capital:

:::incremental
- Cohesion facilitates social norms, trust, and sanctions
- Strong ties enable coordination and knowledge exchange (*bonding*)
:::

:::fragment
@burt2018structural posits that social capital emerges from **structural holes:** opportunities to bridge disconnected groups (*weak ties*):
:::

:::incremental
- Structural holes provide access to diverse perspectives and resources
- Social capital emerges from structurally favorable positions (*bridging*)
:::

:::fragment
This maps directly onto stakeholder engagement: **bonding** ties for core allies, **bridging** ties for new stakeholder access.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The strong/weak tie distinction is crucial for stakeholder management:
- Strong ties (bonding) are reliable but provide redundant information — your close allies tend to know what you know.
- Weak ties (bridging) are less reliable but provide access to new information and diverse perspectives — they connect you to different stakeholder groups.

Effective stakeholder managers need both: strong ties to maintain their core coalition, and weak ties to reach new stakeholder groups and detect emerging issues early.

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through the three dimensions with examples:

![Social capital in the creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social, p. 251]](images/nahapiet.svg){#fig-nahapiet}

- **Structural dimension**: the pattern of connections — *who* is connected to *whom*? Network density, centrality, structural holes.
- **Relational dimension**: the quality of connections — trust, norms, identification, obligations. Two people can have the same network position but very different relational capital.
- **Cognitive dimension**: shared understanding — shared language, codes, narratives. Without cognitive capital, even well-connected, trusting relationships may fail to produce value because parties cannot communicate effectively.

Connect to stakeholder management: successful engagement requires attention to all three dimensions. You need network access (structural), trust and respect (relational), and shared understanding (cognitive).
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Diagnose the **social capital gap** for a key player in the new study program launch.
:::

Group in teams of 2 and distribute following roles:

- The proposer: plays the "Lead Professor" trying to get the Digital Leadership Master's approved.
- The consultant: Helps them analyze their relationship with a "blocker".

The proposer explains their "blocker" problem.\
The consultant uses the three social capital dimensions to find the weakest link.

{{< countdown "6:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Speed consulting (12 min total: 6 min rotation, 6 min plenary).**

"What was the most common social capital gap you diagnosed?" Common answer: cognitive dimension — people underestimate how much shared understanding matters.

Scientific Tie-in: Most will say Cognitive. 

@nahapiet1998social: Social capital isn't just "knowing" people (Structural); it’s having a "shared vision" (Cognitive). If you don't speak the same language as the Finance Office, your Structural connection is useless.

Transition: "Social capital tells us *why* relationships matter. Now let's build tools for systematically identifying and prioritizing stakeholders."

# Stakeholder analysis {.headline-only}

## Who is a stakeholder?

:::medium
> A stakeholder is any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives. *@freeman1984strategic [p. 46]*
:::

:::fragment
This definition is deliberately broad — it forces leaders to look beyond the obvious (shareholders, employees, customers) to include all groups that have a stake in the organization's actions and outcomes.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The stakeholder concept challenges shareholder primacy. For digital leaders, the stakeholder landscape is particularly complex: digital transformation affects employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, communities, and entire industries — often in unpredictable ways.

Connect to [Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd): stakeholders are the people with whom you must build power relationships and manage potential conflicts.
:::

## Stakeholder salience

Not all stakeholders are equally important at any given time. @mitchell1997toward proposed the **stakeholder salience model** based on three attributes:

:::incremental
- **Power:** the stakeholder's ability to influence the organization (coercive, utilitarian, or normative)
- **Legitimacy:** the perceived appropriateness of the stakeholder's claim or relationship
- **Urgency:** the degree to which the stakeholder's claim demands immediate attention (time-sensitivity and criticality)
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The three attributes combine to create seven stakeholder types:

1. **Dormant** (power only) — potential threat if activated
2. **Discretionary** (legitimacy only) — often recipients of philanthropy
3. **Demanding** (urgency only) — can be disruptive but easily dismissed
4. **Dominant** (power + legitimacy) — addressed by formal governance
5. **Dangerous** (power + urgency) — may resort to coercive tactics
6. **Dependent** (legitimacy + urgency) — depend on others to act on their behalf
7. **Definitive** (all three) — demand and deserve immediate attention

The model is dynamic: salience changes over time. A dormant stakeholder can become definitive if they gain legitimacy and urgency.
:::

## The 2×2 matrix

A complementary tool to the salience model: map stakeholders on **interest** (how much they care) × **influence** (how much they can affect outcomes):

:::fragment

|                                  | **Low influence**                                                             | **High influence**                                                                |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High interest[^int]**          | [Keep informed:]{.highlight} <br />regular updates, transparent communication | [Manage closely:]{.highlight} <br />active engagement, involve in decisions       |
| **Low interest**                 | [Monitor:]{.highlight} <br />minimal effort, watch for changes                | [Keep satisfied:]{.highlight} <br />address concerns proactively, don't overwhelm |

: Stakeholder map matrix {#tbl-smm}
:::

[^int]: People are "interested" because they have a valid claim (legitimacy) or a time-sensitive need (urgency).

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The matrix is widely used because of its simplicity. But it has limitations: it's static, doesn't capture network dynamics, and can oversimplify.

Social capital theory enriches the picture: network analysis reveals *how* stakeholders are connected, showing indirect influence paths that the 2×2 matrix misses. A stakeholder with low direct influence but high centrality may be critical for building coalitions.
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Apply salience analysis to a digital transformation scenario.
:::

**Scenario:** Your company is implementing AI-driven customer service in a bank.

1. Identify at least 6 stakeholders
2. Assess each stakeholder's power and interest (legitimacy and urgency)
3. Classify each using the salience model (dormant, discretionary, demanding, dominant, dangerous, dependent, or definitive)
4. Map them on the interest-influence matrix

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Plenary (3 min): "Which stakeholders did mixed groups classify differently? Why?" Push: "Which stakeholder is most likely to be overlooked?" Often: employees whose jobs are threatened.

Transition: "Now that we know *who* the stakeholders are and *how important* they are, the question is: *how deeply* should we engage each one?"
:::

## Matching engagement to salience

:::medium
The engagement level should match the stakeholder's salience:
:::

::::columns
:::{.column .fragment}
[Higher engagement needed]{.h4}

- Definitive stakeholders (all three attributes)
- Stakeholders with veto power
- Groups whose buy-in is critical for implementation
- Internal champions and change agents
:::

:::{.column .fragment}
[Lower engagement sufficient]{.h4}

- Dormant stakeholders (power only)
- Discretionary stakeholders (legitimacy only)
- Groups with low interest and low influence
- Stakeholders who are adequately represented by others
:::
::::

:::notes
The challenge arises when stakeholders *expect* a higher level of engagement than you plan to provide. A labor union that expects to be *collaborated with* but is only *consulted* will feel disrespected and may become oppositional. A board member who expects to be *informed* but is asked to *collaborate* on details may feel their time is wasted.

Getting this calibration right requires stakeholder empathy — the ability to see the situation from each stakeholder's perspective and anticipate their expectations. This connects to emotional intelligence ([Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) and, ultimately, to storytelling (Unit 9): different stakeholders need different narratives.
:::

# Coalition building {.headline-only}

## Coalitions

:::fragment
A coalition is a temporary alliance of stakeholders who share a common interest or goal and pool their resources to achieve it [@murnighan1978models].
:::

:::fragment
Key principles of coalition building:
:::

:::incremental
- **Identify potential allies and blockers** using the stakeholder map — who shares your objectives? Who opposes them? Who is undecided?
- **Start with easy wins:** build momentum by first engaging stakeholders who are predisposed to support you
- **Sequence carefully:** each new ally makes the next one easier to recruit [@lax20063d]. Build a critical mass of support before approaching skeptics.
- **Use reciprocity as currency:** coalitions run on mutual benefit. Understand what each ally needs and find ways to create value for them (connecting to social capital's relational dimension).
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Coalition building is where stakeholder management, social capital theory, and political navigation ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) converge:
- The stakeholder map tells you *who* to engage
- Social capital theory tells you *through whom* to reach them
- Political navigation tells you *how* to exercise influence

Effective coalition builders think several moves ahead — second-order thinking applied to political strategy. "If I engage stakeholder A first, how will that affect my ability to engage stakeholder B?"
:::

## Stakeholder network analysis

Static stakeholder maps miss the **network dynamics** that often determine outcomes.

:::fragment
:::medium
Key question: "Who connects whom? Where are the bridges and bottlenecks?"
:::
:::

:::incremental
- **Centrality:** which stakeholders are most connected? They are likely the most influential, even if they lack formal authority
- **Structural holes:** where are the gaps between stakeholder groups? Bridging these gaps creates opportunities for influence
- **Clusters:** which stakeholders form tight-knit groups? These clusters may act as blocks in coalition dynamics
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Network analysis connects social capital theory directly to practical action:
- Identify a **structural hole** → position yourself as a bridge
- Identify a **central connector** → leverage their network to amplify your message
- Identify **dense clusters** of opposition → develop targeted strategies for each

This is the practical payoff of social capital theory: it provides not just a theoretical framework but a diagnostic tool for real stakeholder challenges.
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Design a complete stakeholder engagement strategy.
:::

Get back to our scenario: Your company is implementing AI-driven customer service in a bank.

1. Propose engagement strategies per stakeholder group.
2. Design a coalition-building sequence — who do you engage first? Through whom?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Push the board to ask: "Why *involve* the works council rather than *collaborate*? What happens if you only *inform* end users?"

The competitive format creates accountability and energy. The "board" perspective forces audience-aware communication — a preview of Unit 9 (storytelling).
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Latticework update {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Which new models have you added to your latticework?
:::

:::fragment
- Stakeholder salience (power × legitimacy × urgency)
- Engagement spectrum as situational tool
- Coalition logic and second-order stakeholder effects
:::

:::notes
Expected connections:

- Lateral leadership ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) now has a systematic stakeholder framework.
- Behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): different stakeholders require different engagement approaches — the same leader must adapt.
- Psychological safety ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)): trust (relational social capital) is the foundation for all stakeholder engagement.
- Network effects from systems thinking: stakeholder relationships create reinforcing loops.
:::

## Closing quote {.no-headline .vertical-center}

:::large
The core intuition guiding social capital research is that the goodwill that others have toward us is a valuable resource 
[@adler2002social].
:::

:::notes
Let this sit. Then transition to homework.
:::

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Reflect on your own cultural background and how it shapes your leadership assumptions:

:::incremental
- What **cultural values** (e.g., from Hofstede's dimensions) are most prominent in your context?
- Have you experienced a situation where **cultural differences** affected leadership or teamwork?
- What **ethical principles** guide your approach to leadership?
:::

:::notes
This reflection prepares for [Unit 8](../context/index.qmd) on cross-cultural leadership, ethical frameworks, and the integration of all course concepts. Students should arrive with a concrete cultural experience they can analyze.

"As you reflect, think about how your cultural background shapes what you expect from leaders — and what leaders you aspire to be."
