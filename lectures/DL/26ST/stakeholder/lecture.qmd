# Introduction {.headline-only}

## Today's session

:::medium
- Activation & check-in [15 min]{.smaller}
- Social capital theory [30 min]{.smaller}
- Stakeholder identification & salience [25 min]{.smaller}
- [Break]{.highlight}
- Engagement spectrum & coalition building [30 min]{.smaller}
- Integrated case exercise [25 min]{.smaller}
- Reflection & closing [10 min]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
135 minutes total.

The session builds on two preparation threads:
1. The pre-reading of @nahapiet1998social (assigned in Unit 4 homework) — students should understand the basic concept of social capital.
2. The homework from Unit 6: students identified stakeholders for a real project and assessed their interest and influence.

- Front-load the social capital theory payoff in Block 1 so students see value in the reading.
- The stakeholder mapping exercise in Block 2 applies frameworks to their own homework examples.
- The integrated case at the end brings social capital, salience, engagement, and coalition building together.
:::

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. **Explain** social capital theory and distinguish structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions
2. **Apply** stakeholder salience analysis (power, legitimacy, urgency) to identify and prioritise stakeholders
3. **Select** appropriate engagement levels using the IAP2 spectrum based on stakeholder attributes
4. **Design** coalition-building strategies using network analysis and second-order thinking

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Stakeholder map check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Review your stakeholder homework.
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Individual review (3 min).**

Ask students to review the stakeholder map they prepared for homework: at least 5 stakeholders, their interest and influence, and relationships between them. This activates the concrete examples that will ground today's theory.
:::

## Pair share {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Compare your stakeholder maps with your neighbor.
:::

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

What differences do you notice in how you identified and assessed stakeholders?

:::notes
**Pair share (4 min).**

Walk around and listen. Common observations: different people identify different stakeholders for similar projects; assessments of interest and influence vary. This highlights the subjective nature of stakeholder analysis and the value of multiple perspectives.
:::

## Plenary debrief {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
What was the hardest part of stakeholder identification? What surprised you?
:::

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Plenary (5 min).**

Common challenges: identifying indirect stakeholders, assessing influence without formal data, recognizing how stakeholders relate to each other.

Preview the session: "Today we'll build systematic frameworks for what you just did intuitively. We'll start with social capital theory — which explains *why* relationships and networks are a resource — then move to practical tools for stakeholder analysis, engagement, and coalition building."

Connect to previous units: "In [Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd), we discussed power, politics, and lateral influence. Today's frameworks give you the tools to *map* those dynamics systematically."
:::

# Social capital theory {.headline-only}

## What is social capital? {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Based on your reading of @nahapiet1998social, how would you define social capital?
:::

{{< countdown "3:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Quick plenary (3 min).**

Let 2–3 students offer definitions. Use their responses to transition to the formal definitions. Expected elements: networks, relationships, resources, trust.
:::

## Key definitions

> ... the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or a social unit. *@nahapiet1998social [p. 243]*

:::fragment
> ... features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefits *@putnam1993prosperous [p. 67]*
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The definitions share two core elements: (1) the **structure of social relations** (networks) and (2) social capital as **a resource for action**. Connect to the reading: @nahapiet1998social conceive social capital as comprising both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network.
:::

## Strong vs. weak ties

@coleman1988social argues that **strong ties** (cohesion) are the source of social capital:

:::incremental
- Cohesion facilitates social norms, trust, and sanctions
- Strong ties enable coordination and knowledge exchange (*bonding*)
:::

:::fragment
@burt2018structural posits that social capital emerges from **structural holes** — opportunities to bridge disconnected groups (*weak ties*):
:::

:::incremental
- Structural holes provide access to diverse perspectives and resources
- Social capital emerges from structurally favorable positions (*bridging*)
:::

:::fragment
This maps directly onto stakeholder engagement: **bonding** ties for core allies, **bridging** ties for new stakeholder access.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The strong/weak tie distinction is crucial for stakeholder management:
- Strong ties (bonding) are reliable but provide redundant information — your close allies tend to know what you know.
- Weak ties (bridging) are less reliable but provide access to new information and diverse perspectives — they connect you to different stakeholder groups.

Effective stakeholder managers need both: strong ties to maintain their core coalition, and weak ties to reach new stakeholder groups and detect emerging issues early.
:::

## Three dimensions of social capital

:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through the three dimensions with examples:

![Social capital in the creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social, p. 251]](images/nahapiet.svg){#fig-nahapiet}

- **Structural dimension**: the pattern of connections — *who* is connected to *whom*? Network density, centrality, structural holes.
- **Relational dimension**: the quality of connections — trust, norms, identification, obligations. Two people can have the same network position but very different relational capital.
- **Cognitive dimension**: shared understanding — shared language, codes, narratives. Without cognitive capital, even well-connected, trusting relationships may fail to produce value because parties cannot communicate effectively.

Connect to stakeholder management: successful engagement requires attention to all three dimensions. You need network access (structural), trust and respect (relational), and shared understanding (cognitive).
:::

## Social capital application exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Map the social capital in your stakeholder network.
:::

Return to the stakeholder map from your homework. For your most important stakeholder relationship:

1. **Structural**: How are you connected? Direct or through intermediaries?
2. **Relational**: What is the quality of the relationship? Trust level?
3. **Cognitive**: Do you share a common language and frame of reference?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (12 min total: 8 min groups, 4 min plenary).**

Form groups of 3–4. Each member analyzes their own most important stakeholder relationship using the three dimensions.

In plenary, ask: "Where were the biggest gaps in your social capital? Which dimension was weakest?" Common answer: cognitive dimension — people underestimate how much shared understanding matters.

Transition: "Social capital tells us *why* relationships matter and *what* makes them work. Now let's build the tools for systematically identifying and prioritizing stakeholders."
:::

# Stakeholder identification & salience {.headline-only}

## Who is a stakeholder?

:::medium
> A stakeholder is any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives. *@freeman1984strategic [p. 46]*
:::

:::fragment
This definition is deliberately broad — it forces leaders to look beyond the obvious (shareholders, employees, customers) to include all groups that have a stake in the organization's actions and outcomes.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The stakeholder concept challenges shareholder primacy. For digital leaders, the stakeholder landscape is particularly complex: digital transformation affects employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, communities, and entire industries — often in unpredictable ways.

Connect to [Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd): stakeholders are the people with whom you must build power relationships and manage potential conflicts.
:::

## Stakeholder salience

Not all stakeholders are equally important at any given time. @mitchell1997toward proposed the **stakeholder salience model**:

:::incremental
- **Power** — the stakeholder's ability to influence the organization (coercive, utilitarian, or normative)
- **Legitimacy** — the perceived appropriateness of the stakeholder's claim or relationship
- **Urgency** — the degree to which the stakeholder's claim demands immediate attention
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The three attributes combine to create seven stakeholder types:

1. **Dormant** (power only) — potential threat if activated
2. **Discretionary** (legitimacy only) — often recipients of philanthropy
3. **Demanding** (urgency only) — can be disruptive but easily dismissed
4. **Dominant** (power + legitimacy) — addressed by formal governance
5. **Dangerous** (power + urgency) — may resort to coercive tactics
6. **Dependent** (legitimacy + urgency) — depend on others to act on their behalf
7. **Definitive** (all three) — demand and deserve immediate attention

The model is dynamic: salience changes over time. A dormant stakeholder can become definitive if they gain legitimacy and urgency.
:::

## Interest-influence matrix

A complementary tool: map stakeholders on **interest** × **influence**:

:::fragment
|  | **Low influence** | **High influence** |
|---|---|---|
| **High interest** | **Keep informed** — regular updates | **Manage closely** — active engagement |
| **Low interest** | **Monitor** — minimal effort | **Keep satisfied** — address concerns proactively |
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The matrix is widely used because of its simplicity. But it has limitations: it's static, doesn't capture network dynamics, and can oversimplify.

Social capital theory enriches the picture: network analysis reveals *how* stakeholders are connected, showing indirect influence paths that the 2×2 matrix misses. A stakeholder with low direct influence but high centrality may be critical for building coalitions.
:::

## Stakeholder mapping exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Apply salience analysis to a digital transformation scenario.
:::

**Scenario:** Your company is implementing AI-driven customer service in a bank.

1. **Identify** at least 6 stakeholders
2. **Assess** each stakeholder's power, legitimacy, and urgency
3. **Classify** each using the salience model (dormant, discretionary, demanding, dominant, dangerous, dependent, or definitive)
4. **Map** them on the interest-influence matrix

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min groups, 5 min plenary).**

Expected stakeholders: bank customers, customer service employees, IT department, bank regulators, AI vendor, labor union, management board, data protection officer.

In plenary, compare group results: different groups often classify the same stakeholder differently. This is the point — salience analysis requires judgment, and multiple perspectives improve the analysis.

Push groups: "Which stakeholder is most likely to be overlooked? Why?" Often: employees whose jobs are threatened (high urgency, legitimacy, but may lack power).

Transition: "Now that we know *who* the stakeholders are and *how important* they are, the question is: *how deeply* should we engage each one?"
:::

# Engagement spectrum & coalition building {.headline-only}

## IAP2 engagement spectrum

The International Association for Public Participation defines five levels of stakeholder engagement:

:::fragment
| Level | Promise to stakeholders | Leader behavior |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Inform** | "We will keep you informed" | One-way communication |
| **Consult** | "We will listen to you" | Two-way feedback |
| **Involve** | "We will work with you" | Active participation |
| **Collaborate** | "We will partner with you" | Shared decision-making |
| **Empower** | "We will implement what you decide" | Delegation of authority |
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The spectrum helps leaders make deliberate choices about engagement depth. Key insight: the engagement level should match stakeholder salience:

- **Definitive stakeholders** → collaborate or empower
- **Dominant stakeholders** → involve or collaborate
- **Dependent stakeholders** → consult or involve
- **Dormant/discretionary stakeholders** → inform

The challenge: when stakeholders *expect* a higher level than you provide. A labor union that expects collaboration but is only consulted will feel disrespected. Getting this calibration right requires stakeholder empathy — seeing the situation from each stakeholder's perspective.

Connect to [Unit 4](../environments/index.qmd): engaging leadership principles apply to stakeholder engagement too. Facilitating, connecting, and strengthening apply not just to teams but to entire stakeholder relationships.
:::

## Coalitions as change mechanism

:::medium
A coalition is a temporary alliance of stakeholders who share a common interest and pool resources to achieve it.
:::

:::fragment
Key principles of coalition building:
:::

:::incremental
- **Identify potential allies and blockers** using the stakeholder map
- **Start with easy wins** — build momentum by engaging predisposed supporters first
- **Sequence carefully** — each new ally makes the next one easier to recruit
- **Use reciprocity as currency** — coalitions run on mutual benefit (social capital's relational dimension)
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Coalition building is where stakeholder management, social capital theory, and political navigation ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) converge:
- The stakeholder map tells you *who* to engage
- Social capital theory tells you *through whom* to reach them
- Political navigation tells you *how* to exercise influence

Effective coalition builders think several moves ahead — second-order thinking applied to political strategy. "If I engage stakeholder A first, how will that affect my ability to engage stakeholder B?"
:::

## Stakeholder network analysis

Static stakeholder maps miss the **network dynamics** that often determine outcomes.

:::fragment
:::medium
Key question: "Who connects whom? Where are the bridges and bottlenecks?"
:::
:::

:::incremental
- **Centrality** — which stakeholders are most connected? They are likely the most influential
- **Structural holes** — where are the gaps between groups? Bridging these creates influence opportunities
- **Clusters** — which stakeholders form tight-knit groups? These may act as blocks in coalition dynamics
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

Network analysis connects social capital theory directly to practical action:
- Identify a **structural hole** → position yourself as a bridge
- Identify a **central connector** → leverage their network to amplify your message
- Identify **dense clusters** of opposition → develop targeted strategies for each

This is the practical payoff of social capital theory: it provides not just a theoretical framework but a diagnostic tool for real stakeholder challenges.
:::

## Integrated case exercise {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Design a complete stakeholder engagement strategy.
:::

**Scenario:** Your company is launching a **digital transformation initiative** — migrating core business processes to a cloud-based platform. You are the project leader.

1. **Identify** stakeholders (aim for at least 8)
2. **Map** interest × influence for each stakeholder
3. **Propose** engagement strategies per stakeholder group (using IAP2 spectrum)
4. **Design** a coalition-building sequence — who do you engage first? Through whom?

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group exercise (15 min total: 10 min groups, 5 min plenary).**

This exercise integrates all the session's concepts. Expected stakeholders: CEO (sponsor), CTO, department heads, IT team, end users, works council/labor union, cloud vendor, data protection officer, customers (indirect), competitors (monitoring).

Push groups to use social capital language: "Which ties are strong? Weak? Where are structural holes you can bridge? What's your coalition sequence?"

Challenge the engagement strategies: "Why did you choose to *involve* the works council rather than *collaborate*? What would happen if you only *informed* end users?"

In plenary, compare coalition sequences across groups. Highlight how second-order thinking changes the sequence: "If you start with the CTO, the IT team becomes easier. If you start with department heads, you build broader buy-in but risk technical objections later."
:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Latticework update

:::medium
**Which new models have you added to your latticework?**
:::

:::fragment
- Stakeholder salience (power × legitimacy × urgency)
- Engagement spectrum as situational tool
- Coalition logic and second-order stakeholder effects
:::

:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).**

Collect on the board alongside earlier models. Ask: "How do these connect to what we already had?"

Expected connections:
- Lateral leadership ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) now has a systematic stakeholder framework.
- Behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): different stakeholders require different engagement approaches — the same leader must adapt.
- Psychological safety ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)): trust (relational social capital) is the foundation for all stakeholder engagement.
- Network effects from systems thinking: stakeholder relationships create reinforcing loops.
:::

## Closing quote {.discussion-slide}

:::large
The core intuition guiding social capital research is that the goodwill that others have toward us is a valuable resource.\
[@adler2002social]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
Let this sit. Then transition to homework.
:::

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Reflect on your own cultural background and how it shapes your leadership assumptions:

:::incremental
- What **cultural values** (e.g., from Hofstede's dimensions) are most prominent in your context?
- Have you experienced a situation where **cultural differences** affected leadership or teamwork?
- What **ethical principles** guide your approach to leadership?
:::

:::notes
This reflection prepares for [Unit 8](../context/index.qmd) on cross-cultural leadership, ethical frameworks, and the integration of all course concepts. Students should arrive with a concrete cultural experience they can analyze.

"As you reflect, think about how your cultural background shapes what you expect from leaders — and what leaders you aspire to be."
