## History {visibility=hidden}

The concept of social capital has been relatively independently introduced by scholars from various disciplines at different times.

Seminal works particularly originate from

- @coleman1988social on the topic of education and utilization of human capital
- @putnam2000bowling on social participation
- @bourdieu1986forms on the relationship between economic, cultural, and social capital
- @burt2018structural on social networks

Since the 1990s the concept of social capital found its way into organizational and management sciences to explain e.g.

:::incremental
- value creation in intrafirm networks [@tsai1998social],
- creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social],
- productivity of R&D teams [@reagans2001networks],
- project performance [@di2012social], and
- business-IT alignment [@wagner2014social].
:::

:::

## Definitions

> Social capital is defined by its function. It is not a single entity, but a variety of different entities having two characteristics in common: They all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals who are within the structure. Like other forms of capital, social capital is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that would not be attainable in its absence *@coleman1988social [p. 98]*

:::fragment
> ... features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefits *@putnam1993prosperous [p. 67]*
:::

------

> ... the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance or recognition *@bourdieu1986forms [p. 21]*

:::fragment
> ... the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual or a social unit. Social capital thus comprises both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network. *@nahapiet1998social [p. 243]*
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

## Similarities and distinctions

The definitions of social capital share some similarities and distinctions:

:::incremental
- There is an emphasis on the **structure of social relations** (networks)
- Social capital is seen as **a resource for action** (individual goal achievement)
- The **level of analysis** stems from macro-level (e.g., societies) to meso/micro-level (e.g., organizations and groups)
- The **causal structure** of social capital is conceived differently\
  - Networks as source of social capital; social capital is a result of network embeddedness [e.g., @bourdieu1986forms; @coleman1988social].
  - The network of relations is equivalent to social capital [e.g., @putnam1993prosperous; @nahapiet1998social].
:::

:::

## Strong vs. weak ties

:::fragment
@coleman1988social argues that cohesion, that is to say the **strength of the relationship between actors**, is the source of social capital (*strong ties*)
:::

:::incremental
- Cohesion facilitates the creation of social norms, trust and sanctions within networks, which safeguard against opportunistic behavior
- Cohesion enables coordination and increases willingness of actors to engage in knowledge exchange (*bonding*)
:::

-------

@burt2018structural posits that social capital rather emerges from **opportunities to bridge disconnections** or non-equivalencies separating non-redundant sources of information (*structural holes*)

:::incremental
- Structural holes (i.e. 'weak ties') provide the opportunity to get access to diverse sets of perspectives, skills, or resources.
- Social capital emerges from structurally favorable positions between different group of actors (*bridging*)
:::

:::fragment
This strong/weak tie distinction maps directly onto stakeholder engagement: **bonding** ties for core allies, **bridging** ties for new stakeholder access.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

The strong/weak tie distinction is crucial for stakeholder management:
- Strong ties (bonding) are reliable but provide redundant information — your close allies tend to know what you know.
- Weak ties (bridging) are less reliable but provide access to new information and diverse perspectives — they connect you to different stakeholder groups.

Effective stakeholder managers need both: strong ties to maintain their core coalition, and weak ties to reach new stakeholder groups and detect emerging issues early.

Structural dimension
: The structural dimension reflects *"the overall pattern of connections between actors"* [@nahapiet1998social, p. 244] — the possibilities of actors to interact with others ('physical' ties)

Relational dimension
: The relational dimension *"relates to the nature and quality of the relationships among team members"* [@robert2008social, p. 319] — the relational strength of ties (trust, respect, norms, identification)

Cognitive dimension
: The cognitive dimension refers to *"those resources providing shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning among parties"* [@nahapiet1998social, p. 244] — the ability to communicate and effectively access resources

:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through the three dimensions with examples:

![Social capital in the creation of intellectual capital  [@nahapiet1998social, p. 251]](images/nahapiet.svg){#fig-nahapiet}

- **Structural dimension**: the pattern of connections — *who* is connected to *whom*? Network density, centrality, structural holes.
- **Relational dimension**: the quality of connections — trust, norms, identification, obligations. Two people can have the same network position but very different relational capital.
- **Cognitive dimension**: shared understanding — shared language, codes, narratives. Without cognitive capital, even well-connected, trusting relationships may fail to produce value because parties cannot communicate effectively.

Connect to stakeholder management: successful engagement requires attention to all three dimensions. You need network access (structural), trust and respect (relational), and shared understanding (cognitive).

:::notes
**Speed consulting (12 min total: 6 min rotation, 6 min plenary).**

"What was the most common social capital gap you diagnosed?" Common answer: cognitive dimension — people underestimate how much shared understanding matters.

Scientific Tie-in: Most will say Cognitive.

@nahapiet1998social: Social capital isn't just "knowing" people (Structural); it's having a "shared vision" (Cognitive). If you don't speak the same language as the Finance Office, your Structural connection is useless.

Transition: "Social capital tells us *why* relationships matter. Now let's build tools for systematically identifying and prioritizing stakeholders."

Opportunities
: The social network creates opportunities for social capital transactions to leverage external resources (*bridging*) and to act together (*bonding*) [@adler2002social].

Motivation
: Contact's motivation determines the share of potential resources. Motivation reflects the willingness to define and act on collective goals caused by shared interests, common identity, and commitment to the common good [@adler2002social].

Ability
: If social relations are mobilized is contingent on resources that enables actors to mobilize their social relations (e.g. shared representations, interpretations, and systems of meaning) [@adler2002social].

According to @adler2002social conceptual model, context plays a critical role in determining the value of social capital. They propose that the value of social capital is not universal or fixed but rather contingent on specific contextual factors. This contextual perspective is significant because it challenges simplistic views that social capital is universally beneficial. Instead, Adler and Kwon emphasize that the value of social capital is situational and dependent on these contextual factors, which helps explain why similar network structures or relationships might yield different outcomes in different settings.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}

## Recommendations

Leadership in modern organizations extends far beyond formal authority. As you develop in your leadership journey, consider these key insights:

- **Recognize that power is multifaceted** — while formal authority is limited, effective leaders cultivate diverse sources of power—both personal (expertise, track record, effort) and positional (relevance, centrality, visibility).
- **Embrace productive politics** — politics isn't inherently negative but rather "power in action." Skilled leaders engage in organizational politics functionally, using influence techniques to navigate interdependencies and resolve conflicts constructively.
- **Manage organizational seams** — pay particular attention to the interfaces between departments and units, as these are where political conflicts often emerge. Your ability to reduce friction at these seams directly impacts organizational effectiveness.
- **Invest strategically in social capital** — your network is a critical resource. Understand that the value of relationships is context-dependent—sometimes strong, cohesive ties are beneficial; other times, weak ties that bridge structural holes provide greater advantage.
  - Apply the opportunity-motivation-ability framework from Adler and Kwon to develop relationships that provide access to resources, information, and support across organizational boundaries.
  - Create alignment through shared values. Use your influence to foster a common vision that can overcome the natural political tensions arising from diversity and interdependence.

Remember that effective leadership requires constant attention to dependencies and relationships. As you progress, continuously reevaluate your sources of power, nurture your network, and adapt your political strategies to changing contexts. In the end, your effectiveness will be judged not by your formal position but by your ability to exercise influence across organizational boundaries.

# Stakeholder identification {.headline-only}

## Who is a stakeholder?

:::medium
> A stakeholder is any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives. *@freeman1984strategic [p. 46]*
:::

:::fragment
This definition is deliberately broad. It forces leaders to look beyond the obvious (shareholders, employees, customers) to include all groups that have a stake in the organization's actions and outcomes.
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The stakeholder concept challenges the shareholder primacy view that the organization's only obligation is to maximize returns for owners. Instead, stakeholder theory argues that long-term organizational success depends on managing relationships with multiple groups whose interests may diverge. This makes stakeholder management a leadership skill, not just a communication exercise.

For digital leaders, the stakeholder landscape is particularly complex: digital transformation affects employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, communities, and entire industries — often in ways that are difficult to predict.

The stakeholder concept challenges shareholder primacy. For digital leaders, the stakeholder landscape is particularly complex: digital transformation affects employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, communities, and entire industries — often in unpredictable ways.

Connect to [Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd): stakeholders are the people with whom you must build power relationships and manage potential conflicts.
:::
:::

## Stakeholder salience

Not all stakeholders are equally important at any given time. @mitchell1997toward proposed the **stakeholder salience model** based on three attributes:

:::incremental
- **Power:** the stakeholder's ability to influence the organization (coercive, utilitarian, or normative)
- **Legitimacy:** the perceived appropriateness of the stakeholder's claim or relationship
- **Urgency:** the degree to which the stakeholder's claim demands immediate attention (time-sensitivity and criticality)
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The three attributes combine to create seven stakeholder types:

1. **Dormant** (power only) — have power but no legitimate claim or urgent need; potential threat if activated
2. **Discretionary** (legitimacy only) — have legitimate claims but no power or urgency; often recipients of philanthropy
3. **Demanding** (urgency only) — make urgent claims but lack power and legitimacy; can be disruptive but are easily dismissed
4. **Dominant** (power + legitimacy) — have both power and legitimate claims; the stakeholders that formal governance structures typically address
5. **Dangerous** (power + urgency) — have power and urgency but may lack legitimacy; can resort to coercive tactics
6. **Dependent** (legitimacy + urgency) — have legitimate and urgent claims but depend on others to act on their behalf
7. **Definitive** (all three) — have power, legitimacy, and urgency; demand and deserve immediate managerial attention

The model is dynamic: stakeholder salience changes over time as attributes are gained or lost. A dormant stakeholder can become definitive if they gain legitimacy and urgency (e.g., a regulator that begins investigating the company).

:::
:::

## The 2×2 matrix

A complementary tool to the salience model: map stakeholders on **interest** (how much they care) × **influence** (how much they can affect outcomes):

:::fragment

|                         | **Low influence**                                              | **High influence**                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High interest[^int]** | **Keep informed** — regular updates, transparent communication | **Manage closely** — active engagement, involve in decisions       |
| **Low interest**        | **Monitor** — minimal effort, watch for changes                | **Keep satisfied** — address concerns proactively, don't overwhelm |

: Stakeholder map matrix {#tbl-smm}
:::

[^int]: People are "interested" because they have a valid claim (legitimacy) or a time-sensitive need (urgency).

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
The interest-influence matrix is widely used in practice because of its simplicity. It translates stakeholder analysis into concrete engagement strategies. However, it has limitations:

- It is a **static snapshot** — stakeholder positions change over time, especially during crises or organizational transitions
- It does not capture **network dynamics** — a low-influence stakeholder who is closely connected to a high-influence stakeholder may be more important than they appear
- It can **oversimplify** — the binary high/low categorization misses nuances

This is where social capital theory enriches the picture: network analysis reveals *how* stakeholders are connected, showing indirect influence paths that the 2×2 matrix misses. A stakeholder with low direct influence but high centrality in the network (a "bridge" in Burt's terms) may be critical for building coalitions.

2. Assess each stakeholder's power and interest (legitimacy and urgency)
3. Classify each using the salience model (dormant, discretionary, demanding, dominant, dangerous, dependent, or definitive)
4. Map them on the interest-influence matrix

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

## Matching engagement to salience

:::medium
The engagement level should match the stakeholder's salience:
:::

::::columns

- Stakeholders with veto power
- Groups whose buy-in is critical for implementation

:::

:::{.column .fragment}
[Lower engagement sufficient]{.h4}

- Dormant stakeholders (power only)
- Discretionary stakeholders (legitimacy only)
- Groups with low interest and low influence
- Stakeholders who are adequately represented by others
:::
::::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
The challenge arises when stakeholders *expect* a higher level of engagement than you plan to provide. A labor union that expects to be *collaborated with* but is only *consulted* will feel disrespected and may become oppositional. A board member who expects to be *informed* but is asked to *collaborate* on details may feel their time is wasted.

Getting this calibration right requires stakeholder empathy — the ability to see the situation from each stakeholder's perspective and anticipate their expectations. This connects to emotional intelligence ([Unit 2](../leader/index.qmd)) and, ultimately, to storytelling (Unit 9): different stakeholders need different narratives.
:::
:::

## Beyond the 2×2 map

Static stakeholder maps are useful starting points, but they miss the **network dynamics** that often determine outcomes.

:::fragment
:::medium
Key question: "Who connects whom? Where are the bridges and bottlenecks?"
:::
:::

:::fragment
Using social capital concepts to analyze stakeholder networks:
:::

:::incremental
- **Centrality:** which stakeholders are most connected? They are likely the most influential, even if they lack formal authority
- **Structural holes:** where are the gaps between stakeholder groups? Bridging these gaps creates opportunities for influence
- **Clusters:** which stakeholders form tight-knit groups? These clusters may act as blocks in coalition dynamics
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Stakeholder network analysis connects social capital theory directly to practical leadership action:

- A leader who identifies a **structural hole** between two important stakeholder groups can position themselves as a bridge, gaining influence by connecting otherwise disconnected parties
- A leader who identifies a **central connector** — a person with ties to many different stakeholder groups — can leverage that person's network position to amplify their message
- A leader who identifies **dense clusters** of opposition can develop targeted strategies for each cluster rather than treating all opponents as a monolithic group

This is the practical payoff of the social capital theory we studied earlier: it provides not just a theoretical framework but a diagnostic tool for real stakeholder challenges.

## Coalitions

Coalitions are a mechanism for achieving change without unilateral authority.

:::fragment
A coalition is a temporary alliance of stakeholders who share a common interest or goal and pool their resources to achieve it [@murnighan1978models].
:::

:::fragment
Key principles of coalition building:
:::

:::incremental
- **Identify potential allies and blockers** using the stakeholder map — who shares your objectives? Who opposes them? Who is undecided?
- **Start with easy wins:** build momentum by first engaging stakeholders who are predisposed to support you
- **Sequence carefully:** each new ally makes the next one easier to recruit [@lax20063d]. Build a critical mass of support before approaching skeptics.
- **Use reciprocity as currency:** coalitions run on mutual benefit. Understand what each ally needs and find ways to create value for them (connecting to social capital's relational dimension).
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Coalition building is where stakeholder management, social capital theory, and political navigation converge. The stakeholder map tells you *who* to engage. Social capital theory tells you *through whom* to reach them (leveraging structural holes and bridging ties). Political navigation ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) tells you *how* to exercise influence.

Effective coalition builders think several moves ahead — this is second-order thinking applied to political strategy. "If I engage stakeholder A first, how will that affect my ability to engage stakeholder B? What signal does it send to stakeholder C?"

# Latticework update

:::medium
New models added to your latticework:
:::

:::incremental
- Stakeholder salience (power × legitimacy × urgency)
- Engagement spectrum as situational tool
- Coalition logic and second-order stakeholder effects
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Expected connections:

- Lateral leadership ([Unit 6](../conflict-power/index.qmd)) now has a systematic stakeholder framework.
- Behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)): different stakeholders require different engagement approaches — the same leader must adapt.
- Psychological safety ([Unit 5](../team/index.qmd)): trust (relational social capital) is the foundation for all stakeholder engagement.
- Network effects from systems thinking: stakeholder relationships create reinforcing loops.

# Homework

Reflect on your own cultural background and how it shapes your leadership assumptions:

- What **cultural values** (e.g., from Hofstede's dimensions) are most prominent in your context?
- Have you experienced a situation where **cultural differences** affected leadership or teamwork?
- What **ethical principles** guide your approach to leadership?
