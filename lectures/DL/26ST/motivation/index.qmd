# Path-goal theory {.headline-only}

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Path-goal theory emphasizes that leaders need to **clarify the paths to goals**, remove obstacles, and provide necessary support to help followers reach their objectives efficiently. It highlights the importance of **adapting leadership behaviors** to suit the needs of followers and the situation they are working in. Ultimately, the theory reminds leaders that their primary role is to coach and guide followers towards goal achievement by **selecting behaviors that best fit followers' needs and the working environment.**
:::

## The core logic

:::medium
Leadership is the act of supplementing what is missing in the environment or the follower to ensure the goal is reachable and rewarding [@house1996path].
:::

:::fragment
The Path-Goal "formula":
:::

:::incremental
1. **Clarify the path.**\
   Remove ambiguity (How do I get there?).
2. **Remove the obstacles.**\
   Fix system problems (What is stopping me?).
3. **Increase the reward.**\
   Make the finish line worth it (Why should I care?).
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Connect to [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd): situational leadership told us to match style to follower readiness.
Path-goal theory goes further — it specifies *which* behaviors work *when* and *why* (through motivational mechanisms).

Walk through each clarifying behavior with a concrete example.
The key insight: path-goal theory is fundamentally about *reducing uncertainty* for followers.
When people know what is expected, how to get there, and what the payoff is, they are more motivated and effective.

Probe: "Which of these clarifying behaviors is most often neglected by leaders you've observed?"
This connects to the reading.
:::

## Leader behavior classes

:::fragment
Leadership behavior classes refers to types of actions and conduct that leaders incorporate into their management styles in order to effectively lead their teams, motivate them, and achieve their goals [@house1996path].
:::

:::fragment
To be effective, a leader must pick the right "tool" based on the follower's needs [@house1974path]:
:::

:::fragment
| Behavior class       | When to use it                        | The essence of the action                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directive            | Task is ambiguous/complex             | Scheduling, standards, and rules (*map*).                     |
| Supportive           | Task is boring/stressful              | Making the work pleasant and approachable (*buffer*).         |
| Participative        | Followers are autonomous/expert       | Consulting and involving them in the plan (*voice*).          |
| Achievement-oriented | Followers are high-performers         | Setting "stretch goals" and showing confidence (*challenge*). |

Which behavior class fits which situation?
:::

In groups of 3, take the behavior classes from @house1974path and:

1. **Match** each behavior class to a concrete leadership scenario.
2. **Identify** the follower and environmental conditions that make each behavior effective.
3. **Connect** at least two behavior classes to CVF quadrants from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd).

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

In plenary, one spokesperson per station presents the synthesized findings.
Push on CVF connections: "Which behavior class maps to the *collaborate* quadrant? The *compete* quadrant?"

Transition: "Path-goal theory tells leaders *what* to clarify.
But how do you create the conditions where followers are *intrinsically* motivated to walk the path?"
:::
:::
:::

## Main propositions

:::medium
Effective leaders do not provide *more of everything.*\
They provide only **what the environment lacks.**
:::

:::fragment
If a task is already clear, directive leadership is seen as annoying micromanagement.\
If a task is already fun, supportive leadership is redundant.
:::

:::fragment
According to @house1996path, goal-oriented/directive behavior is *helpful and instrumental* when:
:::

:::incremental
- **The task is ambiguous:** The path to the goal is unclear.
- **The task is stressful or boring:** The leader provides the structure the task lacks.
- **The followers are inexperienced:** They need the leader to "clear the path."
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Leaders' behavior complements subordinates' environments and abilities. Effective leaders engage in behaviors that align with and support their subordinates' environments and abilities. The higher the degree of subordinates self-perceived ability relative to task demands, the less subordinates will view path-goal clarifying behavior as acceptable (motivational). Leaders' path-goal clarifying behavior adapts to different situations. Effective leaders adjust their behavior based on the specific circumstances, tasks (e.g., ambiguity), and characteristics of their followers (e.g., preference for independence). This adaptability ensures that leaders can effectively guide and motivate their subordinates towards achieving goals [@house1996path].

# From path-goal to motivation {.headline-only}

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Path-goal theory tells leaders *what to clarify* — goals, means, standards, expectancies, and rewards. But how do you create the conditions where followers are **intrinsically motivated** to walk the path?

Self-Determination Theory and engaging leadership address exactly this: the *psychological mechanisms* that turn external guidance into internal drive.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Path-goal theory is largely about *extrinsic* motivation — clarifying what followers get for performing.

SDT shifts the focus to *intrinsic* motivation — creating conditions where followers perform because the work itself is meaningful.
:::
:::

## Expectancy theory

Before we explore intrinsic motivation, a brief look at **expectancy theory** — a complementary lens on motivation.

:::fragment
@vroom1964work proposed that motivation is a function of three beliefs:
:::

:::incremental
- **Expectancy** — "If I try, can I perform?" (from _effort_ to _performance_)
- **Instrumentality** — "If I perform, will I be rewarded?" (from _performance_ to _outcome_)
- **Valence** — "Do I value the reward?" (outcome attractiveness)
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Expectancy theory connects naturally to path-goal theory: a leader who clarifies goals and removes obstacles is directly increasing followers' *expectancy* beliefs ("I can do this"). A leader who links performance to meaningful outcomes is increasing *instrumentality*. And a leader who understands what followers value can ensure that rewards have high *valence*.

However, expectancy theory primarily explains *extrinsic* motivation — motivation driven by external outcomes. What about the deeper drive that comes from the work itself? This is where Self-Determination Theory enters.

# Self-Determination Theory {.headline-only}

## Three basic psychological needs

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [@deci2000what] proposes that humans have three **basic psychological needs** that, when satisfied, fuel intrinsic motivation and well-being:

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::large
[Autonomy]{.fragment}\
[Competence]{.fragment}\
[& Relatedness]{.fragment}
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
- **Autonomy:**  the need to feel volitional and self-directed, to experience choice and psychological freedom in one's actions
- **Competence:** the need to feel effective and capable, to master challenges and experience a sense of growth
- **Relatedness:** the need to feel connected to others, to experience belonging, care, and mutual respect

SDT distinguishes between different types of motivation along a continuum from *extrinsic* to *intrinsic*:

- **External regulation** — behavior driven by external rewards or punishments ("I do it because I'll be paid")
- **Introjected regulation** — behavior driven by internal pressure like guilt or ego ("I do it because I'd feel bad if I didn't")
- **Identified regulation** — behavior driven by personal importance ("I do it because it matters to me")
- **Intrinsic motivation** — behavior driven by inherent interest and enjoyment ("I do it because I find it fascinating")

As motivation moves along this continuum from external to intrinsic, it becomes more autonomous, more sustained, and more associated with well-being and performance. Leaders play a critical role in creating environments that support this internalization process.

## SDT in the workplace

:::medium
Why does SDT matter for leaders?
:::

::::columns
:::{.column .fragment}
**When needs are satisfied:**

- Greater intrinsic motivation
- Higher quality performance
- More creativity and innovation
- Stronger well-being and resilience
- Lower turnover intention

:::

:::{.column .fragment}
**When needs are thwarted:**

- Reliance on external incentives
- Compliance without commitment
- Disengagement and burnout
- Higher absenteeism and turnover
- Resistance to change

:::
::::

:::{.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Consider common leadership practices through the SDT lens:

- **Micromanagement** thwarts autonomy — when every decision must be approved, followers lose the sense of psychological freedom that fuels intrinsic motivation.
- **Unchallenging work** thwarts competence — when tasks are trivial or repetitive, followers cannot experience the mastery that drives engagement.
- **Isolation and competition** thwart relatedness — when team members are pitted against each other or work in silos, the sense of belonging erodes.

Conversely, leaders who delegate meaningful responsibility (autonomy), provide stretch assignments with support (competence), and build genuine team connections (relatedness) create the conditions for sustained high performance.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## SDT in practice {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think about your current study or work environment.
:::

1. Which of the three needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) is **best satisfied**?
2. Which is **most thwarted**?
3. What would a leader do to **address the thwarted need**?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
Expected pattern: autonomy is most often thwarted. Probe: "What would a leader do to address this?" This sets up engaging leadership perfectly.

Transition: "SDT provides the *motivational logic*. Engaging leadership tells us *what leaders actually do* to satisfy these needs."
:::
:::
:::

## From SDT to engaging leadership

:::medium
[SDT provides the **motivational logic;**]{.fragment}\
[Engaging leadership the **leadership operationalization.**]{.fragment}
:::

:::fragment
How do leaders translate SDT's three needs into concrete behaviors?\
This is precisely what engaging leadership theory addresses.
:::

# Engaging leadership {.headline-only}

------

:::large
One of the principal responsibilities of leaders is to [motivate their followers]{.highlight} so that they will perform well.
:::

:::fragment
Engaged employees invest highly in their job because they enjoy it,\
nevertheless they know when to stop [@schaufeli2021engaging].
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture start (3 min).**

Engaging leadership operationalizes SDT for the leadership context. It answers: "If I'm a leader who wants to satisfy my team's basic psychological needs, what exactly should I *do*?"
:::
:::

## Work engagement

:::fragment
Work engagement refers to "a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterized by *vigor*, *dedication*, and *absorption*" [@schaufeli2002measurement, p. 74]
:::

:::incremental
- **Vigor** refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one's work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties.
- **Dedication** refers to being strongly involved in one's work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.
- **Absorption** refers to being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work.
:::

:::fragment
Work engagement differs from **work addiction.** Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don't, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The distinction between engagement and workaholism is important. Engaged employees enjoy their work and know when to stop. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work. The former are attracted by work because it is fun; the latter are driven to work to avoid negative feelings associated with not working.

@taris2014beauty argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation.
:::
:::

## Effects of work engagement

Research shows that work engagement is good for employees as well as for the organizations they work for [see e.g., @schaufeli2013engagement].

:::incremental
- Engaged employees **suffer less from all kinds of stress complaints** (e.g., depression).
- They run a **lower risk of cardiovascular disease** and, hence, they show **lower sickness absenteeism**.
- Engaged employees also feel strongly committed to their organization and therefore show **lower turnover intentions**.
- They often show a **growth mindset** (e.g., like to learn and develop themselves, take personal initiative, and are innovative).
- Engaged employees **perform better** (e.g., make fewer mistakes).
:::

## Engaging leadership

**Engaging leadership** is defined as leadership behavior that facilitates, strengthens, connects and inspires employees in order to increase their work engagement [@schaufeli2021engaging, p. 4]

:::incremental
- **Facilitating** team-members satisfies the need for *autonomy* by giving them the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.
- **Strengthening**  team-members satisfies the need for *competence*, e.g., by delegating tasks and responsibilities, giving them challenging jobs and stimulating their talents.
- **Connecting** team-members satisfies the need for *relatedness*, e.g., by encouraging collaboration and creating a good team spirit.
- **Inspiring** team-members satisfies the need for *meaning*, e.g., by enthusing them about a particular vision, mission, idea or plan and recognising their personal contribution to the overall goal of the team or organisation.
:::

:::fragment
:::smaller
Engaging leadership builds on the principles of **Self-determination Theory (SDT)** [@deci2008self], which focuses on three core psychological needs that drive human motivation: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these needs are satisfied, people experience greater intrinsic motivation and well-being.
:::
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each behavior with a concrete example from a workplace context. Emphasize the SDT connection: each engaging behavior maps to a specific psychological need.

Key point: engaging leadership builds on SDT [@deci2008self]. When these needs are satisfied, people experience greater intrinsic motivation and well-being.
:::
:::

## Effects of engaging leadership

Engaging leadership is expected to lead to the satisfaction of **basic psychological needs**.

:::fragment
Satisfying basic psychological needs subsequently leads to
:::

:::incremental
- strengthened personal **job resources** (e.g., autonomy, task variety, role clarity, social support),
- an increased effect of HR policies (e.g., regarding training and education) on well-being,
- an increase in **work engagement** of employees,
- decrease of **boredom**, and
- increase in **individual performance** and **team performance**.
:::

## Disengaging leadership

According to @schaufeli2021engaging, engaging leadership can be contrasted with its opposite **disengaging leadership**.

:::fragment
Disengaging leadership is characterized by:
:::

:::incremental
- **Coercive behavior** — authoritarian behavior that restricts and controls employees
- **Eroding behavior** — hindering professional development and diminishing competence
- **Isolating behavior** — disconnecting staff from the team and pitting them against each other
- **Demotivating behavior** — creating the impression that employees' work is meaningless
:::

:::fragment
People that exhibit these behaviors thwart the basic needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning.
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This is the dark mirror of engaging leadership. Each disengaging behavior maps to a specific SDT need being thwarted: coercive → autonomy, eroding → competence, isolating → relatedness, demotivating → meaning.

## Leadership scenario #1 {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
A leader rotates meeting facilitation so every team member leads at least one meeting per quarter.
:::

1. Is the leader behavior **engaging** or **disengaging**?
2. Which **specific behavior** is at play (facilitating, strengthening, connecting, inspiring — or coercive, eroding, isolating, demotivating)?
3. Which **psychological need** is being satisfied or thwarted?
4. What would the **opposite** approach look like?

{{< countdown "6:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

Alternatives:

1. "A manager checks in daily with each team member to ask how she can remove obstacles to their work." (Facilitating → autonomy)
2. "A team lead assigns only routine tasks to junior members, saving interesting projects for senior staff." (Eroding → thwarting competence)
3. "A director celebrates team successes publicly but handles failures privately with individuals." (Connecting + strengthening)
4. "A manager uses monitoring software to track employee productivity every 15 minutes." (Coercive → thwarting autonomy)
5. "A leader rotates meeting facilitation so every team member leads at least one meeting per quarter." (Strengthening → competence)

## Leadership scenario #2 {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
A manager uses an automated AI system to assign tasks to the most capable teammate.
:::

1. Is the leader behavior **engaging** or **disengaging**?
2. Which **specific behavior** is at play (facilitating, strengthening, connecting, inspiring — or coercive, eroding, isolating, demotivating)?
3. Which **psychological need** is being satisfied or thwarted?
4. What would the **opposite** approach look like?

{{< countdown "6:00" top="0">}}

## Digital × disengaging leadership {.discussion-slide}

:::large
The digital × disengaging leadership
:::

Discuss in groups of 3:

1. How might "the digital" promote disengaging leadership, albeit unnoticed?
2. How can leaders prevent those they lead from disengaging?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Group discussion (8 min discussion, 4 min plenary).**

Steer the conversation toward examples:

- **Surveillance software** that thwarts autonomy (coercive)
- **Algorithmic task assignment** that erodes competence (eroding)
- **Remote work isolation** that undermines relatedness (isolating)
- **Automated feedback** that strips meaning from work (demotivating)

Push groups to also propose counter-strategies using the engaging leadership framework:

- How do you *facilitate* in a digital environment?
- How do you *connect* distributed team members?
- How do you *strengthen* when you can't observe performance directly?

# Conclusion {.headline-only}

------

:::medium
Leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that [complement]{.link-color}  subordinate's environments and abilities in a manner that [compensates]{.link-color} for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate [satisfaction]{.link-color}  and individual and work unit [performance]{.link-color} [@house1996path, p. 348].

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Plenary synthesis (3 min).**

Connect the full arc: path-goal theory → expectancy theory → SDT → engaging leadership. Each framework adds a layer of understanding about how leaders create conditions for high performance.

The key insight: effective leadership is not about a single behavior but about reading the situation and selecting the right approach. This is behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)) applied to motivation.
:::
:::

## Latticework update

:::medium
New models added to your latticework:
:::

:::incremental
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation continuum
- Path-goal contingency thinking
- Feedback loops: engagement → performance → engagement
:::

:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::{.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).**

Collect these on the board alongside earlier models. Ask: "How do these connect to what we already had?"

Expected connections:

- Behavioral complexity (Unit 3) now includes a motivational dimension — different situations require different motivational approaches.
- Trait paradoxes (Unit 2) connect to engaging/disengaging — the same leader trait can produce engaging or disengaging behavior depending on context.
- CVF quadrants each imply different motivational strategies.
