# Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. Explain Path-Goal Theory and how leaders clarify the path to follower goal achievement.
2. Compare extrinsic and intrinsic motivation using Self-Determination Theory's need framework.
3. Describe engaging leadership and how it operationalizes SDT's basic psychological needs.
4. Contrast engaging and disengaging leadership and their effects on work engagement.

# Path-goal theory {.headline-only}

::: notes
Path-goal theory emphasizes that leaders need to **clarify the paths to goals**, remove obstacles, and provide necessary support to help followers reach their objectives efficiently. It highlights the importance of **adapting leadership behaviors** to suit the needs of followers and the situation they are working in. Ultimately, the theory reminds leaders that their primary role is to coach and guide followers towards goal achievement by **selecting behaviors that best fit followers' needs and the working environment.**
:::

## The core logic

:::medium
Leadership is the act of supplementing what is missing in the environment or the follower to ensure the goal is reachable and rewarding [@house1996path].
:::

:::fragment
The Path-Goal "formula":
:::

:::incremental
1. **Clarify the path.**\
   Remove ambiguity (How do I get there?).
2. **Remove the obstacles.**\
   Fix system problems (What is stopping me?).
3. **Increase the reward.**\
   Make the finish line worth it (Why should I care?).

## Leader behavior classes

:::fragment
Leadership behavior classes refers to types of actions and conduct that leaders incorporate into their management styles in order to effectively lead their teams, motivate them, and achieve their goals [@house1996path].
:::

:::fragment
To be effective, a leader must pick the right "tool" based on the follower's needs [@house1974path]:
:::

:::fragment
| Behavior class       | When to use it                        | The essence of the action                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directive            | Task is ambiguous/complex             | Scheduling, standards, and rules (*map*).                     |
| Supportive           | Task is boring/stressful              | Making the work pleasant and approachable (*buffer*).         |
| Participative        | Followers are autonomous/expert       | Consulting and involving them in the plan (*voice*).          |
| Achievement-oriented | Followers are high-performers         | Setting "stretch goals" and showing confidence (*challenge*). |

## Main propositions

:::medium
Effective leaders do not provide *more of everything.*\
They provide only **what the environment lacks.**
:::

:::fragment
If a task is already clear, directive leadership is seen as annoying micromanagement.\
If a task is already fun, supportive leadership is redundant.
:::

:::fragment
According to @house1996path, goal-oriented/directive behavior is *helpful and instrumental* when:
:::

:::incremental
- **The task is ambiguous:** The path to the goal is unclear.
- **The task is stressful or boring:** The leader provides the structure the task lacks.
- **The followers are inexperienced:** They need the leader to "clear the path."
:::

:::notes
Leaders' behavior complements subordinates' environments and abilities. Effective leaders engage in behaviors that align with and support their subordinates' environments and abilities. The higher the degree of subordinates self-perceived ability relative to task demands, the less subordinates will view path-goal clarifying behavior as acceptable (motivational). Leaders' path-goal clarifying behavior adapts to different situations. Effective leaders adjust their behavior based on the specific circumstances, tasks (e.g., ambiguity), and characteristics of their followers (e.g., preference for independence). This adaptability ensures that leaders can effectively guide and motivate their subordinates towards achieving goals [@house1996path].

# From path-goal to motivation {.headline-only}

:::notes
Path-goal theory tells leaders *what to clarify* — goals, means, standards, expectancies, and rewards. But how do you create the conditions where followers are **intrinsically motivated** to walk the path?

Self-Determination Theory and engaging leadership address exactly this: the *psychological mechanisms* that turn external guidance into internal drive.
:::

## Expectancy theory

Before we explore intrinsic motivation, a brief look at **expectancy theory** — a complementary lens on motivation.

:::fragment
@vroom1964work proposed that motivation is a function of three beliefs:
:::

:::incremental
- **Expectancy** — "If I try, can I perform?" (from _effort_ to _performance_)
- **Instrumentality** — "If I perform, will I be rewarded?" (from _performance_ to _outcome_)
- **Valence** — "Do I value the reward?" (outcome attractiveness)
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence
:::
:::

:::notes
Expectancy theory connects naturally to path-goal theory: a leader who clarifies goals and removes obstacles is directly increasing followers' *expectancy* beliefs ("I can do this"). A leader who links performance to meaningful outcomes is increasing *instrumentality*. And a leader who understands what followers value can ensure that rewards have high *valence*.

However, expectancy theory primarily explains *extrinsic* motivation — motivation driven by external outcomes. What about the deeper drive that comes from the work itself? This is where Self-Determination Theory enters.
:::

# Self-Determination Theory {.headline-only}

## Three basic psychological needs

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [@deci2000what] proposes that humans have three **basic psychological needs** that, when satisfied, fuel intrinsic motivation and well-being:

:::html-hidden
:::large
[Autonomy]{.fragment}\
[Competence]{.fragment}\
[& Relatedness]{.fragment}
:::
:::

:::notes
- **Autonomy:**  the need to feel volitional and self-directed, to experience choice and psychological freedom in one's actions
- **Competence:** the need to feel effective and capable, to master challenges and experience a sense of growth
- **Relatedness:** the need to feel connected to others, to experience belonging, care, and mutual respect

SDT distinguishes between different types of motivation along a continuum from *extrinsic* to *intrinsic*:

- **External regulation** — behavior driven by external rewards or punishments ("I do it because I'll be paid")
- **Introjected regulation** — behavior driven by internal pressure like guilt or ego ("I do it because I'd feel bad if I didn't")
- **Identified regulation** — behavior driven by personal importance ("I do it because it matters to me")
- **Intrinsic motivation** — behavior driven by inherent interest and enjoyment ("I do it because I find it fascinating")

As motivation moves along this continuum from external to intrinsic, it becomes more autonomous, more sustained, and more associated with well-being and performance. Leaders play a critical role in creating environments that support this internalization process.
:::

## SDT in the workplace

:::medium
Why does SDT matter for leaders?
:::

::::columns
:::{.column .fragment}
**When needs are satisfied:**

- Greater intrinsic motivation
- Higher quality performance
- More creativity and innovation
- Stronger well-being and resilience
- Lower turnover intention

:::

:::{.column .fragment}
**When needs are thwarted:**

- Reliance on external incentives
- Compliance without commitment
- Disengagement and burnout
- Higher absenteeism and turnover
- Resistance to change

:::
::::

:::notes
Consider common leadership practices through the SDT lens:

- **Micromanagement** thwarts autonomy — when every decision must be approved, followers lose the sense of psychological freedom that fuels intrinsic motivation.
- **Unchallenging work** thwarts competence — when tasks are trivial or repetitive, followers cannot experience the mastery that drives engagement.
- **Isolation and competition** thwart relatedness — when team members are pitted against each other or work in silos, the sense of belonging erodes.

Conversely, leaders who delegate meaningful responsibility (autonomy), provide stretch assignments with support (competence), and build genuine team connections (relatedness) create the conditions for sustained high performance.
:::

## From SDT to engaging leadership

:::medium
[SDT provides the **motivational logic;**]{.fragment}\
[Engaging leadership the **leadership operationalization.**]{.fragment}
:::

:::fragment
How do leaders translate SDT's three needs into concrete behaviors?\
This is precisely what engaging leadership theory addresses.
:::

# Engaging leadership {.headline-only}

------

:::large
One of the principal responsibilities of leaders is to [motivate their followers]{.highlight} so that they will perform well.
:::

:::fragment
Engaged employees invest highly in their job because they enjoy it,\
nevertheless they know when to stop [@schaufeli2021engaging].
:::

## Work engagement

:::fragment
Work engagement refers to "a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterized by *vigor*, *dedication*, and *absorption*" [@schaufeli2002measurement, p. 74]
:::

:::incremental
- **Vigor** refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one's work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties.
- **Dedication** refers to being strongly involved in one's work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.
- **Absorption** refers to being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work.
:::

:::fragment
Work engagement differs from **work addiction.** Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don't, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.
:::

:::notes
@taris2014beauty argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation. The former are attracted by work because it is fun, whereas the latter are driven to work in an attempt to avoid the negative thoughts and feelings that are associated with not working.
:::

## Effects of work engagement

Research shows that work engagement is good for employees as well as for the organizations they work for [see e.g., @schaufeli2013engagement].

:::incremental
- Engaged employees **suffer less from all kinds of stress complaints** (e.g., depression).
- They run a **lower risk of cardiovascular disease** and, hence, they show **lower sickness absenteeism**.
- Engaged employees also feel strongly committed to their organization and therefore show **lower turnover intentions**.
- They often show a **growth mindset** (e.g., like to learn and develop themselves, take personal initiative, and are innovative).
- Engaged employees **perform better** (e.g., make fewer mistakes).
:::

## Engaging leadership

**Engaging leadership** is defined as leadership behavior that facilitates, strengthens, connects and inspires employees in order to increase their work engagement [@schaufeli2021engaging, p. 4]

:::incremental
- **Facilitating** team-members satisfies the need for *autonomy* by giving them the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.
- **Strengthening**  team-members satisfies the need for *competence*, e.g., by delegating tasks and responsibilities, giving them challenging jobs and stimulating their talents.
- **Connecting** team-members satisfies the need for *relatedness*, e.g., by encouraging collaboration and creating a good team spirit.
- **Inspiring** team-members satisfies the need for *meaning*, e.g., by enthusing them about a particular vision, mission, idea or plan and recognising their personal contribution to the overall goal of the team or organisation.
:::

:::fragment
:::smaller
Engaging leadership builds on the principles of **Self-determination Theory (SDT)** [@deci2008self], which focuses on three core psychological needs that drive human motivation: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. When these needs are satisfied, people experience greater intrinsic motivation and well-being.
:::
:::

## Effects of engaging leadership

Engaging leadership is expected to lead to the satisfaction of **basic psychological needs**.

:::fragment
Satisfying basic psychological needs subsequently leads to
:::

:::incremental
- strengthened personal **job resources** (e.g., autonomy, task variety, role clarity, social support),
- an increased effect of HR policies (e.g., regarding training and education) on well-being,
- an increase in **work engagement** of employees,
- decrease of **boredom**, and
- increase in **individual performance** and **team performance**.
:::

## Disengaging leadership

According to @schaufeli2021engaging, engaging leadership can be contrasted with its opposite **disengaging leadership**.

:::fragment
Disengaging leadership is characterized by:
:::

:::html-hidden
:::large
[coercive behavior, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[eroding behavior,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[isolating behavior,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and demotivating behavior.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

:::notes
- **Coercive behavior**, which refers to authoritarian behaviour that restricts and controls employees.
- **Eroding behavior** that aims to hinder staff members' professional development and diminish their sense of competence
- **Isolating behavior** that disconnects staff from the rest of the team and pits them against each other
- **Demotivating behavior** that aims to create the impression that employees' work is meaningless and that their work does not contribute to anything important.
:::

:::fragment
People that exhibit these behaviors thwart the basic needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning.
:::

# Conclusion {.headline-only}

------

:::medium
Leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that [complement]{.link-color}  subordinate's environments and abilities in a manner that [compensates]{.link-color} for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate [satisfaction]{.link-color}  and individual and work unit [performance]{.link-color} [@house1996path, p. 348].
