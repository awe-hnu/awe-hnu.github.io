:::notes
135 minutes total.

The session is designed as a flipped classroom — students have pre-read @house1996path and answered four guiding questions about the essence of path-goal theory, leader behavior classes, personal experiences, and empirical evidence.
:::

## Learning objectives

After completing this unit, you will be able to:

::: incremental
1. **Explain** Path-Goal Theory and how leaders clarify the path to follower goal achievement.
2. **Compare** extrinsic and intrinsic motivation using Self-Determination Theory's need framework.
3. **Describe** engaging leadership and how it operationalises SDT's basic psychological needs.
4. **Contrast** engaging and disengaging leadership and their effects on work engagement.

# Activation {.headline-only}

## Latticework check-in {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Which mental models from previous units might help us think about motivation?
:::

Think for yourself and share after the countdown is over.

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Expected connections:

- **Incentive structures** — how do rewards and punishments shape follower behavior?
- **Feedback loops** — how does engagement create performance which reinforces engagement?
- **Behavioral complexity** from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd) — leaders must adapt their motivational approach to the situation
- **CVF** — the *collaborate* quadrant is fundamentally about motivating through people
:::

## Individual reflection {.discussion-slide}

:::large
Write down your findings.
:::

1. **The essence** of path-goal theory in one sentence.
2. **One leader behavior class** from @house1996path that you have experienced personally.

After the countdown share your insights with your neighbor. Two minutes per person.

{{< countdown "4:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Students who did the reading should be able to articulate that path-goal theory is about leaders adapting their behavior to complement follower abilities and environmental conditions.

# Path-goal theory {.headline-only}

## The core logic

:::medium
Leadership is the act of supplementing what is missing in the environment or the follower to ensure the goal is reachable and rewarding [@house1996path].
:::

:::fragment
The Path-Goal "formula":
:::

:::incremental
1. **Clarify the path.**\
   Remove ambiguity (How do I get there?).
2. **Remove the obstacles.**\
   Fix system problems (What is stopping me?).
3. **Increase the reward.**\
   Make the finish line worth it (Why should I care?).
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Connect to [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd): situational leadership told us to match style to follower readiness. 
Path-goal theory goes further — it specifies *which* behaviors work *when* and *why* (through motivational mechanisms).

Walk through each clarifying behavior with a concrete example. 
The key insight: path-goal theory is fundamentally about *reducing uncertainty* for followers. 
When people know what is expected, how to get there, and what the payoff is, they are more motivated and effective.

Probe: "Which of these clarifying behaviors is most often neglected by leaders you've observed?" 
This connects to the reading.
:::

## Leader behavior classes

:::fragment
Leadership behavior classes refers to types of actions and conduct that leaders incorporate into their management styles in order to effectively lead their teams, motivate them, and achieve their goals [@house1996path].
:::

:::fragment
To be effective, a leader must pick the right "tool" based on the follower's needs [@house1974path]:
:::

:::fragment
| Behavior class       | When to use it                        | The essence of the action                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directive            | Task is ambiguous/complex             | Scheduling, standards, and rules (*map*).                     |
| Supportive           | Task is boring/stressful              | Making the work pleasant and approachable (*buffer*).         |
| Participative        | Followers are autonomous/expert       | Consulting and involving them in the plan (*voice*).          |
| Achievement-oriented | Followers are high-performers         | Setting "stretch goals" and showing confidence (*challenge*). |

## Leader behavior classes {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Which behavior class fits which situation?
:::

In groups of 3, take the behavior classes from @house1974path and:

1. **Match** each behavior class to a concrete leadership scenario.
2. **Identify** the follower and environmental conditions that make each behavior effective.
3. **Connect** at least two behavior classes to CVF quadrants from [Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd).

{{< countdown "10:00" top="0">}}

:::notes

| Behavior class       | When to use it                        | The essence of the action                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directive            | Task is ambiguous/complex             | Scheduling, standards, and rules (*map*).                     |
| Supportive           | Task is boring/stressful              | Making the work pleasant and approachable (*buffer*).         |
| Participative        | Followers are autonomous/expert       | Consulting and involving them in the plan (*voice*).          |
| Achievement-oriented | Followers are high-performers         | Setting "stretch goals" and showing confidence (*challenge*). |

In plenary, one spokesperson per station presents the synthesized findings. 
Push on CVF connections: "Which behavior class maps to the *collaborate* quadrant? The *compete* quadrant?"

Transition: "Path-goal theory tells leaders *what* to clarify. 
But how do you create the conditions where followers are *intrinsically* motivated to walk the path?"
:::

## Main propositions

:::medium
Effective leaders do not provide *more of everything.*\
They provide only **what the environment lacks.**
:::

:::fragment
If a task is already clear, directive leadership is seen as annoying micromanagement.\
If a task is already fun, supportive leadership is redundant.
:::

:::fragment
According to @house1996path, goal-oriented/directive behavior is *helpful and instrumental* when:
:::

:::incremental
- **The task is ambiguous:** The path to the goal is unclear.
- **The task is stressful or boring:** The leader provides the structure the task lacks.
- **The followers are inexperienced:** They need the leader to "clear the path."
:::

# From path-goal to motivation {.headline-only}

:::notes
Path-goal theory is largely about *extrinsic* motivation — clarifying what followers get for performing. 

SDT shifts the focus to *intrinsic* motivation — creating conditions where followers perform because the work itself is meaningful.
:::

## Expectancy theory

@vroom1964work proposed that motivation is a function of three beliefs:

:::incremental
- **Expectancy** — "If I try, can I perform?" (effort → performance)
- **Instrumentality** — "If I perform, will I be rewarded?" (performance → outcome)
- **Valence** — "Do I value the reward?" (outcome attractiveness)
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence
:::
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Connect naturally to path-goal theory: a leader who clarifies goals and removes obstacles increases *expectancy*. A leader who links performance to outcomes increases *instrumentality*. A leader who understands what followers value ensures high *valence*.

However, expectancy theory primarily explains *extrinsic* motivation. What about the deeper drive from the work itself? Transition to SDT.
:::

## Three basic psychological needs

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [@deci2000what] proposes three **basic psychological needs** that fuel intrinsic motivation:

:::large
[Autonomy]{.fragment}\
[Competence]{.fragment}\
[& Relatedness]{.fragment}
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

- **Autonomy** — the need to feel volitional and self-directed
- **Competence** — the need to feel effective and capable, to master challenges
- **Relatedness** — the need to feel connected to others, to experience belonging

SDT distinguishes motivation along a continuum from external regulation ("I do it because I'll be paid") through identified regulation ("I do it because it matters to me") to intrinsic motivation ("I do it because I find it fascinating").

As motivation moves from external to intrinsic, it becomes more autonomous, more sustained, and more associated with well-being and performance. Leaders play a critical role in creating environments that support this internalization process.
:::

## SDT in practice {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Think about your current study or work environment.
:::

1. Which of the three needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) is **best satisfied**?
2. Which is **most thwarted**?
3. What would a leader do to **address the thwarted need**?

{{< countdown "5:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Expected pattern: autonomy is most often thwarted. Probe: "What would a leader do to address this?" This sets up engaging leadership perfectly.

Transition: "SDT provides the *motivational logic*. Engaging leadership tells us *what leaders actually do* to satisfy these needs."
:::

# Engaging leadership {.headline-only}

## What is engaging leadership?

:::large
One of the principal responsibilities of leaders is to [motivate their followers]{.highlight} so that they will perform well.
:::

:::fragment
**Engaging leadership** is leadership behavior that facilitates, strengthens, connects and inspires employees to increase their work engagement [@schaufeli2021engaging, p. 4].
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture start (3 min).**

Engaging leadership operationalizes SDT for the leadership context. It answers: "If I'm a leader who wants to satisfy my team's basic psychological needs, what exactly should I *do*?"
:::

## Four engaging behaviors

:::incremental
- **Facilitating** satisfies the need for *autonomy* — giving team members the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.
- **Strengthening** satisfies the need for *competence* — delegating tasks, giving challenging jobs, stimulating talents.
- **Connecting** satisfies the need for *relatedness* — encouraging collaboration and creating good team spirit.
- **Inspiring** satisfies the need for *meaning* — enthusing team members about a vision and recognizing their contribution.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (5 min).**

Walk through each behavior with a concrete example from a workplace context. Emphasize the SDT connection: each engaging behavior maps to a specific psychological need.

Key point: engaging leadership builds on SDT [@deci2008self]. When these needs are satisfied, people experience greater intrinsic motivation and well-being.
:::

## Work engagement

Work engagement refers to "a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind characterized by *vigor*, *dedication*, and *absorption*" [@schaufeli2002measurement, p. 74].

:::incremental
- **Vigor** — high energy and mental resilience, willingness to invest effort, persistence in the face of difficulties.
- **Dedication** — being strongly involved, experiencing significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge.
- **Absorption** — being fully concentrated and happily engrossed, time passes quickly.
:::

:::fragment
Work engagement differs from **work addiction**: engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation; workaholics have a negative (avoidance) motivation [@taris2014beauty].
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

The distinction between engagement and workaholism is important. Engaged employees enjoy their work and know when to stop. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work. The former are attracted by work because it is fun; the latter are driven to work to avoid negative feelings associated with not working.
:::

## Disengaging leadership

Disengaging leadership is characterized by:

:::incremental
- **Coercive behavior** — authoritarian behavior that restricts and controls employees
- **Eroding behavior** — hindering professional development and diminishing competence
- **Isolating behavior** — disconnecting staff from the team and pitting them against each other
- **Demotivating behavior** — creating the impression that employees' work is meaningless
:::

:::fragment
People who exhibit these behaviors thwart the basic needs for autonomy, competence, relatedness, and meaning.
:::

:::notes
**Mini-lecture (3 min).**

This is the dark mirror of engaging leadership. Each disengaging behavior maps to a specific SDT need being thwarted: coercive → autonomy, eroding → competence, isolating → relatedness, demotivating → meaning.
:::

## Leadership scenario #1 {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
A leader rotates meeting facilitation so every team member leads at least one meeting per quarter.
:::

1. Is the leader behavior **engaging** or **disengaging**?
2. Which **specific behavior** is at play (facilitating, strengthening, connecting, inspiring — or coercive, eroding, isolating, demotivating)?
3. Which **psychological need** is being satisfied or thwarted?
4. What would the **opposite** approach look like?

{{< countdown "6:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Alternatives:

1. "A manager checks in daily with each team member to ask how she can remove obstacles to their work." (Facilitating → autonomy)
2. "A team lead assigns only routine tasks to junior members, saving interesting projects for senior staff." (Eroding → thwarting competence)
3. "A director celebrates team successes publicly but handles failures privately with individuals." (Connecting + strengthening)
4. "A manager uses monitoring software to track employee productivity every 15 minutes." (Coercive → thwarting autonomy)
5. "A leader rotates meeting facilitation so every team member leads at least one meeting per quarter." (Strengthening → competence)

:::

## Leadership scenario #2 {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
A manager uses an automated AI system to assign tasks to the most capable teammate.
:::

1. Is the leader behavior **engaging** or **disengaging**?
2. Which **specific behavior** is at play (facilitating, strengthening, connecting, inspiring — or coercive, eroding, isolating, demotivating)?
3. Which **psychological need** is being satisfied or thwarted?
4. What would the **opposite** approach look like?

{{< countdown "6:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
Build the pattern:
engaging and disengaging behaviors are context-dependent — the same action can be either, depending on how it's experienced.
:::

## Digital × disengaging leadership {.discussion-slide}

:::large
The digital × disengaging leadership
:::

Discuss in groups of 3:

1. How might "the digital" promote disengaging leadership, albeit unnoticed?
2. How can leaders prevent those they lead from disengaging?

{{< countdown "8:00" top="0">}}

:::notes
**Group discussion (8 min discussion, 4 min plenary).**

Steer the conversation toward examples:

- **Surveillance software** that thwarts autonomy (coercive)
- **Algorithmic task assignment** that erodes competence (eroding)
- **Remote work isolation** that undermines relatedness (isolating)
- **Automated feedback** that strips meaning from work (demotivating)

Push groups to also propose counter-strategies using the engaging leadership framework:

- How do you *facilitate* in a digital environment?
- How do you *connect* distributed team members?
- How do you *strengthen* when you can't observe performance directly?

:::

# Reflection & closing {.headline-only}

## Synthesis

:::medium
Leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that [complement]{.link-color} subordinate's environments and abilities in a manner that [compensates]{.link-color} for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate [satisfaction]{.link-color} and individual and work unit [performance]{.link-color} [@house1996path, p. 348].
:::

:::notes
**Plenary synthesis (3 min).**

Connect the full arc: path-goal theory → expectancy theory → SDT → engaging leadership. Each framework adds a layer of understanding about how leaders create conditions for high performance.

The key insight: effective leadership is not about a single behavior but about reading the situation and selecting the right approach. This is behavioral complexity ([Unit 3](../adaptive-behavior/index.qmd)) applied to motivation.
:::

## Latticework update {.discussion-slide}

:::medium
Which new models have you added to your latticework?
:::

:::incremental
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation continuum
- Path-goal contingency thinking
- Feedback loops: _engagement_ leads to _performance_ leads to _engagement_
:::

:::notes
**Plenary closing (5 min).**

Collect these on the board alongside earlier models. Ask: "How do these connect to what we already had?"

Expected connections:

- Behavioral complexity (Unit 3) now includes a motivational dimension — different situations require different motivational approaches.
- Trait paradoxes (Unit 2) connect to engaging/disengaging — the same leader trait can produce engaging or disengaging behavior depending on context.
- CVF quadrants each imply different motivational strategies.
:::

## Closing quote

:::large
Engaged employees invest highly in their job because they enjoy it — nevertheless they know when to stop
[@schaufeli2021engaging].

# Homework {.discussion-slide}

Read @nahapiet1998social and answer the following questions:

- What is social capital?
- What advantages does social capital bring?
- How does social capital relate to leadership?

:::notes
As you read, think about which types of relationships — strong or weak ties — are most valuable for leaders. 
We will return to this later in the course.
