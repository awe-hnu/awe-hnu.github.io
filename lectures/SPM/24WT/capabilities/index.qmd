# Internal audit {.headline-only  background-color="#0333ff"}

## Overview

:::html-hidden
:::medium
Assessing a firm's [strengths and weaknesses]{.fragment .highlight-blue} so that strategies can be formulated that [capitalize on internal strengths]{.fragment .highlight-blue} and [overcome weaknesses]{.fragment .strike}.
:::
:::

:::notes
The internal audit focuses on identifying and evaluating a firm's strengths and weaknesses in the functional areas of business, including management, marketing, finance, accounting, production/operations, research and development (R&D), and management of IT/the digital [@david2016strategic].

All organizations have strengths and weaknesses in the functional areas of business. No enterprise is equally strong or weak in all areas. Internal strengths and weaknesses, coupled with external opportunities and threats provide the basics for strategic planning. Objectives and strategies are established with the intention of capitalizing on internal strengths and overcoming weaknesses.

## Culture

:::large
> Culture eats strategy for breakfast. *Peter Drucker, Management consultant, educator and author*
:::

. . .

:::html-hidden
The most brilliant strategies can fail if they are not congruent with the prevailing culture within an organization. Successful organizations, thus, **integrate culture and strategy**. 
:::

:::notes

The phrase conveys the idea that a company's culture, which includes its shared values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can have a more substantial influence on the organization's outcomes than its strategic plans or strategies. In other words, a well-crafted strategy may look excellent on paper, but if it doesn't align with or is undermined by the prevailing organizational culture, it is less likely to succeed [@drucker1988coming].

- **An organization's culture influences how employees behave, make decisions, and interact with one another**. If a strategic plan contradicts cultural norms or values, employees are likely to prioritize cultural consistency over strategic alignment.
- **Culture can either enable or constrain the execution of strategic initiatives.** A supportive culture aligns with the strategy, fosters commitment, and drives performance. Conversely, a culture that resists change or lacks alignment can hinder even the most well-conceived strategy.
- **Leaders play a crucial role in shaping and aligning culture with strategy.** Effective leaders understand the culture's impact and work to foster a culture that supports the strategic vision.
- **Successful organizations integrate culture and strategy.** They develop strategies that not only consider external market dynamics but also respect and leverage the existing culture. Additionally, they may seek to evolve the culture to better support strategic goals.

**Implications** [@david2016strategic]:

- Strategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive changes can take considerable time and effort
- Political maneuvering consumes valuable time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some valuable employees
- Political biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded in strategy choice decisions

# Reading — key takeaways {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

Form small groups of 3 to 4 students and discuss what you have learned about the resource-based view (RBV) from reading @peteraf1993cornerstones. 

Summarize the key tenets of the RBV (at least one slide) and derive the key implications for strategic management (at least one slide). 

Be prepared to present your findings in a five-minute presentation.

<!--

The RBV posits that a firm's competitive advantage is primarily driven by its unique and valuable resources and capabilities. Peteraf's paper delves into the essential elements of this view, highlighting the following key points:

1. Resources as the Foundation: The RBV emphasizes that a firm's resources serve as the foundation of its competitive advantage. Resources encompass tangible and intangible assets such as physical assets, human capital, technology, brand reputation, and knowledge. These resources are unique to each firm and can lead to a competitive edge when strategically leveraged.

2. Resource Heterogeneity: Peteraf stresses the importance of resource heterogeneity, which means that firms possess different sets of resources, and these resources vary in terms of their rarity, value, inimitability, and non-substitutability. This heterogeneity is a critical factor in determining competitive advantage.

3. Resource Immobility: The paper also highlights the concept of resource immobility, suggesting that some resources are not easily transferable or replicable by competitors. This immobility can contribute to sustained competitive advantage.

4. Dynamic Capabilities: Peteraf introduces the idea of dynamic capabilities, which refers to a firm's ability to adapt, reconfigure, and innovate its resources and capabilities over time. Dynamic capabilities are crucial for firms to respond effectively to changing market conditions and maintain their competitiveness.

5. Competitive Advantage and Value Creation: The ultimate goal of the RBV is to create value for customers, and thus, competitive advantage. Firms that possess and effectively deploy valuable, rare, and inimitable resources can provide unique products or services, meet customer needs, and outperform rivals in the market.

6. Limitations and Challenges: While the RBV provides valuable insights into competitive advantage, the paper acknowledges that it is not without challenges. Identifying and measuring resources and capabilities, understanding their causal relationships, and managing dynamic capabilities can be complex tasks for organizations.

Implications for Business Administration: Peteraf's paper has significant implications for business administration. It underscores the importance of understanding and leveraging a firm's unique resources and capabilities to gain and sustain a competitive advantage. Business administrators and strategists should carefully assess their firm's resource portfolio, continually monitor changes in the competitive landscape, and develop dynamic capabilities to adapt and thrive in a dynamic business environment.

In summary, "The Cornerstones of Competitive Advantage: A Resource-Based View" provides a foundational understanding of the RBV and its relevance in explaining why some firms outperform others. It emphasizes the central role of resources, resource heterogeneity, and dynamic capabilities in shaping a firm's competitive advantage. This paper serves as a cornerstone for scholars and practitioners in the field of strategic management and business administration.

## Key assumptions

:::html-hidden
The RBV contends that **internal resources** are critical for achieving and sustaining **competitive advantage**, even more important than the environment.

:::medium
Questions of [value]{.fragment .highlight-blue}, [rareness]{.fragment .highlight-blue}, [imitability/substitutability]{.fragment .highlight-blue} (VRIN), and [organisation]{.fragment .highlight-blue} must be addressed.
:::
:::


:::notes
Understanding the sources of competitive advantages calls for an analysis of not only the company’s environment (opportunities and threats), but its own/internal strengths and weaknesses as well [@barney1995looking].

This point is clearly highlighted when we consider the success achieved by companies such as WalMart, Southwest Airlines and Nucor Steel, despite unfavorable environments.

A firm’s internal attributes – its resources and capabilities – include all the financial, physical, human and organisational assets used by a firm to develop, manufacture and deliver products/services to its customers.

Resources and capabilities that cannot be readily matched by competitors are referred to as **distinctive competencies**. To identify a company's distinctive competencies, resources and capabilities must be evaluated by considering four important questions:

- The question of value.
- The question of rareness.
- The question of imitability.
- The question of organisation.

## The question of value {visibility=hidden}

Resources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm's ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues [@barney1995looking].

Managers need to check if the firm’s resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats.

- Managers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities. 
- Managers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not.
- Managers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors.
- Managers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways.

## The question of rareness {visibility=hidden}

Resources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage [@barney1995looking].

Therefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them.

- If a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, i.e. it is valuable but common, then it forms a source of competitive parity.
- Resources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage.

## The question of imitability {visibility=hidden}

Resources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes or alternatives for the resource. In other words, competitors cannot easily find a different resource to replace or replicate the unique value of the resource or capability [@barney1995looking].

Thus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability identified as valuable and rare face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it, compared to firms that already possess it.

- If a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.  
- If competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage.
- Imitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources.

## The question of organization {visibility=hidden}

The organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the four VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization to maximize its impact. In addition, resources often work best when they are integrated with other resources and capabilities within the organization [@barney1995looking]? 

Thus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities.

- A firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage arising from the value, rareness and imitability of its resources and capabilities.
- The firm’s complementary resources – for example, its formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant/important for a firm to realize competitive advantage.
- To create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation.

# Dynamic capabilities {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Overview

:::medium
Dynamic capabilities refer to a firm's ability to [integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external resources]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to address [rapidly changing environments]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [[@teece1997dynamic].]{.smaller}
:::

:::notes
RBV emphasizes the assessment of internal resources and capabilities to identify those that can provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities play a critical role in adapting and reconfiguring these resources over time to maintain their competitiveness. 

By developing dynamic capabilities, organizations can better navigate change and respond effectively to new challenges. They are thus **a source of sustainable competitive advantage**, allowing firms to continuously renew and adapt their strategies. To cultivate dynamic capabilities, organizations must prioritize learning, adaptation, and the ongoing renewal of their strategic initiatives.

:::notes
@teece1997dynamic concept of dynamic capabilities essentially says that what matters for business is corporate agility: the capacity to (1) sense and shape opportunities and threats, (2) seize opportunities, and (3) maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise’s intangible and tangible assets.

**Sensing:** Dynamic capabilities begin with the ability to sense changes in the external environment, such as shifts in customer preferences or emerging market trends. This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.

**Seizing:** Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

**Reconfiguring:** In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization's structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation.

Dynamic capabilities reflect the evolutionary fitness of organizations, which describes how well an organization can adapt to its environment and maintain competitive advantage [@steininger2022dynamic].

What role do IT/information systems play?

:::notes
Apple Inc. provides a compelling illustration of dynamic capabilities in action. Over the years, Apple has demonstrated its ability to sense market changes, seize opportunities, and reconfigure its resources effectively, all of which are central elements of dynamic capabilities.

- Sensing: Apple constantly monitors consumer trends, technological advancements, and shifts in the global market.
They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.
- Seizing: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007.
The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.
- Reconfiguring: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple's app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.

Apple's success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. This adaptability and innovation have enabled Apple to consistently deliver products and services that resonate with consumers worldwide.

IT as an enabler of dynamic capabilities
: IT provides the tools and infrastructure necessary for developing dynamic capabilities. For example, advanced data analytics and cloud computing enable organizations to quickly process and analyze large volumes of data, facilitating better decision-making and faster responses to market changes.

IT embedded in dynamic capabilities
: In this perspective, IT is integrated into the very fabric of dynamic capabilities. For instance, IT systems are embedded in processes such as supply chain management and customer relationship management, enhancing the organization’s ability to sense and respond to changes in the environment.

IT as an outcome of dynamic capabilities
: Dynamic capabilities can lead to the development and enhancement of IT capabilities. For example, an organization that excels in innovation may develop new IT solutions or improve existing ones as a result of its dynamic capabilities.

IT as context
: IT shapes the context within which dynamic capabilities are developed and deployed. The digital environment, characterized by rapid technological advancements and digital transformation, creates a context that necessitates the development of dynamic capabilities to remain competitive. Environmental uncertainty and industry conditions are two critical contextual factors that shape how organizations develop and deploy their capabilities. Environmental uncertainty refers to the unpredictability and lack of information regarding external factors that can impact an organization. This includes changes in technology, market dynamics, regulatory shifts, and economic fluctuations. Industry conditions refer to the specific characteristics and dynamics of the industry in which an organization operates. This includes factors like industry structure, competitive intensity, and the rate of innovation. These need to be considered in the external audit.

![SWOT matrix](images/SWOT.svg){#fig-SWOT}

The environment reveals external opportunities and threats. The resource-based view emphasizes the significance of internal resources and capabilities in achieving competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities represent an organization's ability to adapt and reconfigure its resource base over time. 

When combined, these concepts offer a comprehensive framework for strategic management. By combining these perspectives, the **Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) framework** offers a starting point to develop and think through a strategy, particularly four types of strategies:

- **SO strategies** (strengths-opportunities): using a firm’s internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities
- **WO strategies** (weaknesses-opportunities): improving internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities
- **ST strategies** (strengths-threats): using a firm's strengths to avoid or reduce the impact of external threats
- **WT strategies** (weaknesses-threats): defensive tactics directed at reducing internal weakness and avoiding external threats

:::

## Process

Steps in using the SWOT framework:

:::incremental
1. Perform an *external audit* to identify opportunities and threats
2. Perform an *internal audit* to identify strengths and weaknesses
3. Allocate internal and external factors in the matrix
2. Review whether allocation to (one) box is correct
3. Structure the points in each box (i.e. group under headline, structure in sub-levels)
4. Review potential relevance (and disregard as appropriate)
5. Test whether statement is true and quantify where possible
6. Review, prioritize
7. Develop strategies based on the analysis:     
   *How to leverage strengths to exploit opportunities?*    
   *How to address weaknesses to mitigate threats?*

Widespread use of SWOT
: The SWOT Matrix lends itself to discussion among managers. It is conceptually simple with no numbers and includes key internal and external factors that provide the basis for alternative strategies. Brainstorming sessions are common in business and the SWOT is a nice framework for such an activity.

Limitations of SWOT
: Although the most widely utilized of all strategic planning tools, the SWOT analysis does
have some limitations. First, SWOT does not show how to achieve a competitive advantage, so
it must not be an end in itself. Second, SWOT is a static assessment (or snapshot) in time. Third,
SWOT analysis may lead the firm to overemphasize a single internal or external factor in
formulating strategies.
