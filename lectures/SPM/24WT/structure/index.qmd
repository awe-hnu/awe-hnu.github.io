# Organizational alignment {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Definition

::: medium
@powell1992organizational defines organizational alignment as [the
coherence among various components within an
organization,]{.fragment fragment-index="1"} [including structure,
processes, culture, and strategies.]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}
:::

## Efects

::: medium
Firms with a high degree of alignment [are better equipped to
]{.fragment fragment-index="1"}[adapt to changes in their external
environment,]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="1"} [are
more ]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}[resilient to threats]{.fragment
.highlight-current-blue fragment-index="2"} [and better able to
]{.fragment fragment-index="3"}[capitalize on emerging
opportunities]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="3"}
[@powell1992organizational][.]{.smaller}
:::

::: notes
@powell1992organizational shows empirically that same organizational
alignments produce supernormal profits, independent of the profits
produced by traditional industry and strategy variables, which is well
aligned with the resource based view of the firm [@teece1982towards].

Achieving a high level of organizational alignment can, thus, serve as a
unique source of competitive advantage. Firms that effectively align
their internal components are better equipped to enhance performance,
respond to market changes, and create a distinctive position in their
industries.
:::

## Components

@powell1992organizational identifies four dimensions of organizational
alignment that significantly relate to profitability:

::: medium
[Internal structural fit,]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue
fragment-index="1"} [size-structure fit,]{.fragment
.highlight-current-blue fragment-index="2"} [size-planning components
fit,]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="3"} [and locus
of control.]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="4"}
:::

::: fragment
Whereas structural fit seems to be the most significant source of
competetive advantage.
:::

::: notes
-   **Internal structural fit** refers to the coherence and alignment of
    various components within an organization's internal structure. This
    can include the alignment of strategies, processes, and
    organizational culture.
-   **Size-structure fit** relates to how well the organizational
    structure matches the size and complexity of the organization. It
    involves ensuring that the structure is appropriately scaled to the
    organization's operations.
-   **Size-planning components fit** focuses on the alignment between
    the organization's size and its planning components. This may
    include how well planning processes, such as budgeting and
    forecasting, align with the organization's size.
-   **Locus of control** refers to an individual's belief regarding the
    degree to which they can control events affecting them. In an
    organizational context, it can be relevant in understanding
    leadership styles and decision-making processes.

## 7s Framework

![McKinsey 7S Framework [@hayes2002theory, p.
137]](images/7s.svg){#fig-types}

::: notes
Based on an organizational alignment thinking, McKinsey proposed the 7s
Framework. The framework is a tool designed to help business owners and
managers to identify critical alignment issues by proposing seven
elements need to be aligned and mutually reinforcing. The model can be
used to help identify what needs to be realigned to improve performance,
or to maintain alignment during phases of change (e.g., restructuring,
new processes, organizational merger, new systems, change of
leadership).

The elements are [@channon2015mckinsey]:

-   **Strategy**: Strategy is defined as the set of actions that a firm
    plans in response or anticipation of changes to its external
    environment. These actions allow a firm to improve its competitive
    positioning. Purpose of the business and the way the organization
    seeks to enhance its competitive advantage.
-   **Structure**: Structure allow the firm to focus on areas that are
    deemed important for its evolution. This includes division of
    activities; integration and coordination mechanisms.
-   **Systems:** These include formal and informal procedures for
    measurement, reward and resource allocation.
-   **Shared values**: These values define the firm's key beliefs and
    aspirations that form the core of its corporate culture.
-   **Skills**: The organization's core competencies and distinctive
    capabilities. It is argued that old skills can often act as
    hindrance in developing new skills.
-   **Staff**: Staff considers people as a pool of resources, which need
    to be nurtured, developed, guarded, and allocated. It includes
    organization's human resources, demographic, educational and
    attitudinal characteristics.
-   **Style**: Typical behavior patterns of key groups, such as CEOs,
    managers, and other professionals.

# Organizational structures {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Simple structure

::: {.r-stack .html-hidden}
![Simple structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/simple-1.svg){.fragment height="420"}

![ ](images/simple.svg){.fragment height="420"}
:::

::: notes
A *simple structure* in organizational terms refers to a basic and
straightforward organizational design characterized by minimal
hierarchy, few rules and procedures, and centralization of
decision-making. It is often found in small, entrepreneurial
organizations, particularly in their early stages of development [see
e.g., @dess2014strategic].

![Simple structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/simple.svg){#fig-simple}

Key features of a simple structure include:

-   **Low formalization:** Procedures, rules, and processes are minimal.
    The organization relies on informal communication and flexibility.
    Simple structures often prevail in entrepreneurial environments
    where agility and quick decision-making are critical.
-   **Centralized decision-making:** Decision-making authority is
    concentrated at the top of the organization, usually with the
    founder or a small leadership team. Leaders can directly supervise
    and interact with employees, fostering close relationships.
-   **Low specialization:** Job roles and tasks are not highly
    specialized. Employees often wear multiple hats and perform a
    variety of functions.
-   **Quick response to changes:** The simplicity of the structure
    allows for quick adaptation to changes in the environment or market
    conditions.

While a simple structure has its advantages, such as flexibility and
quick decision-making, it may face challenges as the organization grows.
As the organization expands, there is often a need for more
formalization, departmentalization, and delegation of authority. This
evolution may lead to the adoption of more complex organizational
structures, such as functional structures or divisional structures, to
accommodate the increased size and complexity of the organization.
:::

## Functional structure

::: {.r-stack .html-hidden}
![Functional structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/functional-1.svg){.fragment height="420"}

![ ](images/functional.svg){.fragment height="420"}
:::

::: notes
In a *functional structure* is an organizational design that groups
employees based on their specialized functions or roles within the
organization. In a functional structure, employees with similar skills
and expertise are organized into functional departments or units, each
focused on a specific aspect of the organization's operations. This
structure is common in many types of organizations and is often
characterized by clear lines of authority and reporting
[@dess2014strategic; @david2016strategic].

![Functional structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/functional.svg){#fig-functional}

Key features of a functional structure include:

-   **Clear hierarchy:** The structure typically follows a clear
    hierarchical framework with a top-down chain of command. Each
    functional department is headed by a manager or director reporting
    to top leadership.
-   **Specialization and expertise:** Allows for a high level of
    specialization and expertise within each functional area. Employees
    focus on tasks related to their specific functions, leading to
    efficiency and depth of knowledge.
-   **Centralized decision-making:** Decision-making authority is often
    centralized at the top of the hierarchy, with top-level executives
    making key strategic decisions that affect the entire organization.
-   **Efficient use of resources:** Resources, such as personnel and
    equipment, are efficiently allocated within each functional
    department. This specialization can lead to economies of scale and
    resource optimization.
-   **Clarity of roles:** Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined
    within each functional department, contributing to role clarity and
    well-defined job descriptions.
-   **Communication within functions:** Communication predominantly
    occurs vertically within each functional department. Employees
    within the same function share a common language and understanding
    of their specific area of expertise.

Functional structures are well-suited for organizations with a
relatively simple product or service line, where efficiency, expertise,
and clear specialization are essential. However, they may face
challenges when it comes to interdepartmental coordination and
communication, especially in dynamic environments where cross-functional
collaboration is crucial. Organizations may also adopt additional
structures, such as matrix structures or divisional structures, to
address the limitations of a purely functional approach in more complex
or diversified settings.
:::

## Divisional structure

::: {.r-stack .html-hidden}
![Divisional structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/divisional-1.svg){.fragment height="420"}

![ ](images/divisional.svg){.fragment height="420"}
:::

::: notes
A *divisional structure* in organizational terms refers to a design that
organizes an enterprise into semi-autonomous units or divisions, each
responsible for a distinct product, service, or customer group. Each
division within the structure operates as a separate business entity
with its own functional areas, such as marketing, finance, and
operations, though some functional are performed in each separate
division and centrally (e.g., finance). The divisions are organized by
product or service, customer-types, or process (i.e., strategic business
units). This structure is often adopted by large organizations with
diverse product lines or those operating in multiple markets
[@dess2014strategic; @david2016strategic].

![Divisional structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/divisional.svg){#fig-divisional}

Key features of a divisional structure include:

-   **Divisional autonomy:** Divisions operate with a significant degree
    of autonomy. They have their own leadership, decision-making
    processes, and strategic initiatives.
-   **Product, market, or geographic focus:** This allows for
    specialization and focused attention on the unique needs of each
    market or product line.
-   **Functional independence:** Each division has its own set of
    functional areas (e.g., marketing, finance, operations) to support
    its specific activities. This enables divisions to adapt and respond
    more efficiently to the requirements of their particular markets.
-   **Profit and loss accountability:** Divisions are often held
    accountable for their own financial performance. This accountability
    is reflected in their profit and loss statements, making divisions
    responsible for their own costs, revenues, and profitability.
-   **Coordination at the corporate level:** While divisions operate
    independently, there is usually coordination at the corporate level.
    Corporate headquarters may provide support functions that serve all
    divisions, such as human resources, legal, and overall strategic
    planning.
-   **Strategic flexibility:** The divisional structure offers strategic
    flexibility, allowing each division to tailor its strategies to the
    specific demands of its market or product category. This
    adaptability can enhance responsiveness to changes in the business
    environment.
-   **Clear accountability:** The structure provides clear lines of
    accountability, making it easier to assess the performance of each
    division individually. This clarity helps in making informed
    decisions about resource allocation and strategic adjustments.

The divisional structure is particularly suitable for large and complex
organizations with diverse business interests. It allows for
specialization and focused management attention in each division,
fostering agility and responsiveness to market variations. However, it
also requires effective coordination and communication between the
corporate center and the individual divisions to ensure alignment with
overall organizational objectives.
:::

## International structure {visibility="hidden"}

::: notes
An *international structure* in organizational terms refers to a design
that reflects the geographical dispersion of an organization's
operations. It is similar to a divisional structure, where the divisions
are structured by geographical aspects. This structure is particularly
relevant for companies that operate in multiple countries or regions.
The international structure is crafted to address the complexities and
challenges associated with managing operations across different
geographic locations, each with its own cultural, legal, and economic
characteristics.

The adoption of an international structure is often driven by a
company's expansion into global markets. As organizations grow and seek
opportunities beyond their home country, the need for a structure that
accommodates and leverages the diversity of international markets
becomes imperative. This structure facilitates effective coordination
and adaptation to local conditions while maintaining a global
perspective and overall corporate strategy.
:::

## Matrix structure

::: {.r-stack .html-hidden}
![Matrix structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/matrix-1.svg){.fragment height="420"}

![ ](images/matrix.svg){.fragment height="420"}
:::

::: notes
A *matrix structure* in organizational terms is a hybrid organizational
design that combines elements of both functional and divisional
structures. In a matrix structure, employees have dual reporting
relationships - they report both to a functional manager and to a
product, project, or geographic manager. This structure is particularly
useful for organizations dealing with complex projects, multiple
products, or a combination of functional and divisional demands
[@dess2014strategic; @david2016strategic].

![Matrix structure based on
@dess2014strategic](images/matrix.svg){#fig-matrix}

Key features of a matrix structure include:

-   **Combines the functional dimension** (grouping by skills or
    expertise) **with the divisional dimension** (grouping by product,
    project, or geographic area). This allows for flexibility in
    addressing both functional and divisional needs.
-   **Dual reporting relationships:** Employees report to both a
    functional manager (based on their area of expertise, such as
    marketing or finance) and a project or divisional manager (based on
    the specific project, product, or geographic area they are working
    on). Functional and Divisional Dimensions:
-   **Enhanced communication and coordination:** Facilitates improved
    communication and coordination between different parts of the
    organization, as individuals from various functional areas
    collaborate on specific projects or products.
-   **Project-based teams:** Often involves the creation of
    project-based or cross-functional teams where individuals from
    different functional areas work together on specific tasks or
    projects.
-   **Flexibility and responsiveness:** Offers greater flexibility and
    responsiveness to changes in the external environment, as the
    organization can quickly adapt to new projects, market demands, or
    technological advancements.
-   **Resource efficiency:** Allows for efficient use of resources, as
    individuals with specific expertise can be allocated to projects or
    products as needed without being limited by the boundaries of a
    traditional functional structure.
-   **Complex decision-making:** Involves more complex decision-making
    processes, as employees may need to navigate and balance the
    expectations and priorities of both their functional and divisional
    managers.

While the matrix structure offers advantages in terms of flexibility and
responsiveness, it can also pose challenges related to potential
conflicts, power struggles, and the complexity of reporting
relationships. Effective communication, collaboration, and a clear
understanding of roles and responsibilities are crucial for the success
of a matrix structure. The matrix structure is often adopted in
industries such as information technology, aerospace, or complex
project-based organizations where interdisciplinary collaboration is
essential.

# Excursus: CIO/CDO {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Reflection {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

Form small groups of 3 to 4 students. Discuss your findings from reading
@lorenz2023perfect. Create a presentation that summarises the key
findings. Each presentation should last 5 minutes.

Your summary must include the following considerations:

-   the roles of CDO and CIO,
-   strategic reasons for introducing a CDO role,
-   the dynamics and challenges related to the relationship between CDOs
    and CIOs,
-   (structural) ambidexterity in relation to the roles of CIO and CDO,
-   and recommendations for the design and implementation of
    organisational structures that efficiently support digital
    transformation.

## Roles

The **Chief Information Officer (CIO)** [traditionally leads the IT
department, ensuring technology infrastructure supports organizational
goals. They manage data, information systems, and IT operations as well
as they address cybersecurity, data privacy, and compliance with IT
regulations.]{.fragment}

. . .

The **Chief Digital Officer (CDO)** [is responsible for driving digital
innovation and transformation across the organization. They often focus
on enhancing customer experiences through digital channels and
technologies. They collaborate across departments to integrate digital
solutions into various aspects of the business.]{.fragment}

. . .

::: medium
They may face challenges in aligning strategic objectives and
collaborating effectively.
:::

::: notes
-   CIOs often focus on stable IT operations, while CDOs prioritize
    innovation, sometimes causing tensions in their priorities.
-   Communication gaps can arise due to differing perspectives on
    technology's role in the organization.
:::

## Strategic imperative for a CDO

::: medium
The CDO role is typically introduced [with the objective of ]{.fragment
fragment-index="1"}[leading digital transformation
initiatives]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="1"} [and
ensuring that the organization ]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}[maintains
a competetive edge in the digital age]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue
fragment-index="2"}.
:::

::: notes
-   CDOs foster a culture of innovation, identifying opportunities for
    digital technologies to create new business models and revenue
    streams.
-   Organizations appoint CDOs to respond quickly to market changes and
    technological advancements (i.e., need for agility)
:::

## Structural ambidexterity

::: medium
Organizations need to balance [exploitation]{.fragment
.highlight-current-blue fragment-index="1"} (efficiency and
optimization, led by the CIO)\
[and ]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}[exploration]{.fragment
.highlight-current-blue fragment-index="2"} (innovation and new
opportunities, led by the CDO).
:::

::: notes
Recommendations for organizational structures:

-   Cultivate a culture that supports both roles
-   Establish effective coordination mechanisms allows CDOs and CIOs to
    work synergistically, e.g., foster open and continuous communication
    between the CDO and CIO to ensure alignment and shared goals.
-   Clearly define reporting lines and responsibilities for both the CDO
    and CIO to avoid ambiguity.
-   Encourage cross-functional collaboration and the formation of teams
    that integrate digital and IT expertise.

# Organizational evolution {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Prologue

> As the fit between strategy, structure, people and processes is never
> perfect, most successful firms go through **periods of convergence**
> --- in which they make only incremental changes, followed by
> **upheaval** -- in which they carry out major, system-wide changes or
> reorientations, to adapt to environmental shifts.
> @mintzberg2014strategy

## Periods of convergence

::: medium
In convergent periods [stable and interconnected social
systems]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="1"} emerge,
[in which ]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}[the most successful and
resilient actors maintain their position]{.fragment
.highlight-current-blue fragment-index="2"}.
:::

::: notes
Convergence starts with an effective integration of strategy, structure,
people and processes. It is an on-going process characterized by
incremental change [@mintzberg2014strategy]:

-   Refining policies, methods, and procedures.
-   Creating specialized units and linking mechanisms.
-   Developing personnel especially suited to the present strategy.
-   Fostering individual and group commitments to the company mission
    and to the excellence of one's own department.
-   Promoting confidence in the accepted norms, beliefs, and myths.
-   Clarifying established roles, power, status, dependencies, and
    allocation mechanism.
:::

::: fragment
Convergent periods are a double-edged sword, they

::: incremental
-   help the organisation develop internal forces for effectiveness and
    stability; and
-   lead to self-confidence and less flexibility (less vigilance and
    greater resistance to change)
:::
:::

## Frame-braking change

::: medium
Frame-braking change occurs in response to or, better yet, in
anticipation of major environmental changes.
:::

::: fragment
The need for such **discontinuous change** usually springs from one or a
combination of ...

::: incremental
-   industry discontinuities (e.g., emergence of substitutes),
-   product life-cycle shifts (e.g., shifting from the emergence phase
    to the maturity stage),
-   or internal company dynamics (e.g., changes in shareholder
    structure)
:::
:::

::: notes
Frame-breaking change is driven by shifts in the business strategy.
Frame-breaking changes are revolutionary changes of the system, as
opposed to incremental changes in the system.

Frame-breaking changes usually involves the following features:

-   Reformed mission and core values
-   Altered power and status
-   Reorganisation
-   Revised interaction patterns
-   New executives
:::

## Leadership

During **periods of convergence** ...

::: incremental
-   executive leadership focuses on maintaining congruence and fit
    within the organisation;
-   leadership re-emphasizes strategy, mission and core values, while
    keeping an eye on external opportunities/threats.
:::

**Frame-breaking** change requires ...

::: incremental
-   direct executive involvement in all aspects of the change;
-   this involves specification of the strategy, structure, people,
    processes and in the development of implementation plans;
:::

. . .

Effective executives foresee the need for major change, and act before
they are forced by circumstances/crisis to do so.

. . .

Most frame-breaking upheavals are managed by executives brought in from
outside the company. The process benefits from their fresh perspective,
new skills and the impetus for a new start.

## Exercise {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

Please turn to your neighbour and identify an example of an organisation
that has recently undergone or is currently undergoing a transformative
change (i.e., frame-breaking change).

Outline how the strategy has changed and how it has affected the
adaptation of other components, for example, those reflected by the 7s
framework.

Please prepare to present your findings.

# Review and consolidation

The following questions are designed to review and consolidate what you
have learned and are a good starting point for preparing for the exam.

::: smaller
-   Explain the concept of organizational alignment.
-   Relate the 7s framework to the concept of organizational alignment.
-   List reasons why firms with a high degree of organizational
    alignment are better able to adapt to changes in their external
    environment, are more resilient to threats and better able to
    capitalize on emerging opportunities.
-   Do a research on *Strategic Business Unit* (SBU) structure and
    explain the difference between a SBU structure and a divisional
    organizational structure.
-   Discuss advantages and disadvantages of a functional versus a
    divisional organizational structure.
-   Compare and contrast the roles of Chief Information Officer (CIO)
    and Chief Digital Officer (CDO) in an organization. How do their
    responsibilities contribute to strategy formation and strategy
    implementation?
-   Define and elaborate on the concept of structural ambidexterity in
    the context of CIO and CDO roles. How can organizations achieve a
    balance between exploitation and exploration in their structures?
-   How can organizational structures be designed to facilitate
    effective collaboration between different functional areas?
