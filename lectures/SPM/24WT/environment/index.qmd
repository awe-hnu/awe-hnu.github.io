# External audit {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Overview

:::html-hidden
:::medium
Scanning the [**environment**]{.fragment .highlight-blue} to identify [**key variables**]{.fragment .highlight-blue} so that strategies can be formulated to take advantage of [**the opportunities**]{.fragment .highlight-blue} and reduce the impacts of **[the threats]{.fragment .strike}**.
:::
:::

:::notes

The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition. Competition is caused not only by other players, but also by the broader environment (e.g., the underlying economics/structure of the industry) [@mintzberg2014strategy]. The *external strategic management audit*[^audit] focuses on identifying and evaluating environmental trends and events beyond the control of a single firm [@david2016strategic].

The purpose of an external audit is to develop a **finite list** of opportunities that could benefit a firm as well as threats that should be avoided. As the term finite suggests, the external audit is not aimed at developing an exhaustive list of every possible factor that could influence the business; rather, it is aimed at identifying **key variables** that offer actionable responses.

Identifying and evaluating external opportunities and threats enables organizations to develop a clear mission, to design strategies to achieve long-term objectives, and to develop policies to achieve annual objectives. Firms should be able to respond either offensively or defensively to the factors by formulating strategies that take advantage of external opportunities or that minimize the impact of potential threats.
:::

[^audit]: The external strategic management audit is sometimes also called environmental scanning or industry analysis.

## Key external forces

:::html-hidden
External forces can be divided into five broad categories: 

:::medium
[Economic;]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[social, cultural, demographic, and environmental;]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[political, governmental, and legal;]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[technological;]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[and competitive forces.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

:::notes
External forces can be divided into five broad categories: 

- economic forces
- social, cultural, demographic, and environmental (S C D E) forces
- political, governmental, and legal forces
- technological forces
- competitive forces

:::callout-note
#### Characteristics of forces

When identifying and prioritizing key external factors in strategic planning, make sure the factors selected are (1) specific (i.e., quantified to the extent possible); (2) actionable (i.e., meaningful in terms of having strategic implications); and (3) stated as external trends, events, or facts rather than as strategies the firm could pursue [@david2016strategic].
:::

## Key variables {visibility=hidden}

### Economic forces {visibility=hidden}

Relevant economic variables such as those listed below must be quantified and actionable to be useful [@david2016strategic, p. 222].

- Shift to service economy
- Availability of credit
- Level of disposable income
- Propensity of people to spend
- Interest rates
- Inflation rates
- GDP trends
- Consumption patterns
- Unemployment trends
- Currency rates
- Import/export factors
- Demand shifts for different goods and services
- Income differences by region and consumer group
- Price fluctuations
- Foreign countries’ economic conditions
- Monetary and Fiscal policy
- Stock market trends
- Tax rate variation by country and state
- Economic policies (e.g., OPEC policies)

### Social, cultural, demographic, and environmental forces {visibility=hidden}

SCDE-forces are shaping the way people live, work, produce, and consume, e.g. [@david2016strategic, p. 224]:

- Population changes by race, age, and geographic area
- Regional changes in tastes and preferences
- Number of marriages, divorces, births, deaths
- Immigration and emigration rates
- Life expectancy rates
- Per capita income
- Social media pervasiveness
- Attitudes toward retirement
- Energy conservation
- Attitudes toward product quality and customer service
- Social responsibility issues

### Political, governmental, and legal forces {visibility=hidden}

Local, state, and federal laws, as well as regulatory agencies and special-interest groups, can have a major impact on the strategies of small, large, for-profit, and nonprofit organizations [@david2016strategic, p. 226].

- Environmental regulations
- Protectionist actions by countries
- Changes in patent laws
- Equal employment opportunity laws
- Level of defense expenditures
- Unionization trends
- Antitrust legislation
- Political conditions in countries
- Local, state, and federal laws
- Import-export regulations
- Tariffs
- Local, state, and national elections

### Technological forces {visibility=hidden}

New technologies such as AI, the Internet of Things, 3d printing, biotech, and robotics are fueling innovation in many industries, and impacting strategic-planning decisions [@david2016strategic].

In high-tech industries, identification and evaluation of key technological opportunities and threats can be the most important part of the external strategic-management audit.

### Competitive forces {visibility=hidden}

An important part of an external audit is identifying rival firms and determining their strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, opportunities, threats, objectives, and strategies.

Key questions according to @david2016strategic [p. 227]:

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of our major competitors?
- What products and services do we offer that are unique in the industry?
- What are the objectives and strategies of our major competitors?
- How will our major competitors most likely respond to current economic, S C D E, political, governmental, legal, technological, and competitive trends affecting our industry?
- How vulnerable are the major competitors to our new strategies, products, and services?
- How vulnerable is our firm to successful counterattack by our major competitors?
- How does our firm compare to rivals in mastering the social-media conversation in this industry?
- To what extent are new firms entering and old firms leaving this industry?
- What key factors have resulted in our present competitive position in this industry?
- How are supplier and distributor relationships changing in this industry?
:::

## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

What are legal and ethical means of obtaining competitive intelligence, defined as the acquisition of insights about competitors that are important to one's own business?

:::notes
- Reverse-engineer rival firms’ products
- Use surveys and interviews of customers, suppliers, and distributors of rival firms
- Conduct fly-over and drive-by visits to rival firm operations
- Search online databases
- Contact government agencies for public information about rival firms
- Monitor relevant trade publications, magazines, and newspapers
- Purchase social-media data about customers of all firms in the industry
- Hire top executives from rival firms

# Porter's Five-Forces Model {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Overview

:::html-hidden
The essence of strategy formulation is **coping with competition**.

:::fragment
:::medium
Porter proposed a framework for [**competitive analysis**]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} of a specific industry based on [**five basic forces**]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} that determine the ultimate [**profit potential**]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} of that industry.
:::
:::
:::

:::notes

Porter’s Five-Forces Model of competitive analysis is a widely used approach for developing strategies in many industries [@porter1986competition].

According to @porter1986competition, the state of competition in an industry depends on five basic forces. The collective strength of these forces determines the ultimate profit potential of that industry.

Knowledge/analysis of the underlying sources of competitive pressures provides the groundwork for effective strategic courses of action.

## Contending forces {visibility=hidden}

### Threat of entry

New entrants bring new capacity, substantial resources and a desire to gain market share from the incumbents.

The seriousness of the threat of entry depends on the **barriers of entry.**

There are six major sources of barriers to entry:

1. Economies of scale
2. Product differentiation
3. Capital requirements
4. Cost disadvantages independent of size
5. Access to distribution channels
6. Government policy

It seems reasonable to posit that a new entrant will be deterred if:

- Incumbents have previously attacked new entrants.
- Incumbents possess substantial resources to fight back – excess cash, unused borrowing power, productive capacity, clout with distribution channels and customers.
- Incumbents can cut prices to keep market share.
- There is industry-wide excess capacity.
- Industry growth is slow.

### Powerful suppliers and buyers

Suppliers can exert bargaining power on industry players by raising prices, or reducing the quality of goods/services. A supplier group is powerful if:

- It is dominated by a few companies and is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
- Its product is unique, differentiated or if it has built up switching costs.
- It is not obliged to contend with other products for sale to the industry.
- It poses a credible threat of integrating forward into the industry's business.
- The industry is not an important customer of the supplier group.

Similarly, customers can force down prices, demand higher quality/more service or play competition off against each other. A buyer group is powerful if:

- It is concentrated or purchases in large volumes.
- The products it purchases from the industry are standard/undifferentiated.
- The purchases form a component of its own product, and represent a significant fraction of its cost.
- It earns low profits, and has an incentive to lower its purchasing costs.
- The industry’s product is unimportant to the quality of the buyer’s products/services.
- The industry’s product does not save the buyer money.
- Buyers pose a credible threat of integrating backward.

### Substitute products

Substitute products/services limit the potential of an industry by placing a ceiling on the prices that can be charged. The more attractive the price-performance trade-off offered by substitute products, the greater the impact on the industry’s profitability.

Substitute products that deserve the most attention strategically are those that:

1. are subject to trends improving their price-performance trade-off with the industry’s product and
2. are produced by industries earning high profits.

:::

## Tactics

:::medium
Maneuvers such as **price competition**, **product introductions**, **advertising battles**, etc. are often used by rivals jockeying for position (i.e., "ploys").
:::

:::notes

Intense rivalry is related to the presence of a number of factors:

- Competitors are numerous, or are roughly equal in size and power
- Industry growth is slow, precipitating fights for market share
- The product/service lacks differentiation or switching costs
- Fixed costs are high, or the product is perishable
- Capacity is normally augmented in large increments
- Exit barriers are high
- Rivals are diverse in strategies, origins and ‘personalities’

# Megatrends {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Overview

:::html-hidden
:::medium
**Long-term, global, and transformative trends** that bring about **fundamental changes** and transformations in **various domains** and at **multiple levels**.
:::
:::

:::notes
The concept of megatrends in strategic management refers to long-term, global, and transformative trends that significantly impact various aspects of society, the economy, industries, and organizations. These trends are characterized by their sustained and pervasive influence over many years, often spanning decades. Megatrends shape the business landscape, influence consumer behavior, drive technological innovation, and create both opportunities and challenges for businesses and other stakeholders.

Key characteristics and aspects of the concept of megatrends include:

- **Long-term perspective:** Megatrends unfold over extended periods, typically spanning 10 to 20 years or more. They represent enduring shifts in societal, economic, and technological dynamics.
- **Global impact:** Megatrends transcend geographical boundaries and affect countries, regions, and industries worldwide. They have a broad and pervasive reach.
- **Transformational effects:** Megatrends bring about fundamental changes and transformations in various domains, including demographics, technology, environment, politics, and culture. They reshape the way people live, work, and interact.
- **Cross-industry relevance:** Megatrends impact multiple industries and sectors, often requiring organizations to adapt, innovate, and adjust their strategies to remain competitive and relevant.
- **Strategic implications:** Organizations must consider megatrends in their strategic planning processes. Failure to do so can result in missed opportunities or exposure to risks associated with not aligning with the evolving landscape.
:::

## Examples

The [Zukunftsinstitut](https://www.zukunftsinstitut.de/dossier/megatrends/) identifies 12 long-term, transformative forces that impact all aspects of society, economy, and individual lives:

:::html-midden

## Climate Change {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000" .no-headline}

:::medium
Neo-ecology: climate change requires sustainable and environmental practices.
:::

Form groups of three to four students, discuss the reading material provided by @hallegatte2009strategies, and create a summary of the key findings concerning **the importance of climate change** for contemporary firms, **the difficulties** encountered when dealing with it, and **strategies for robust decision-making**. Additionally, reflect on the implications these findings have for strategic management. 

Each group should be prepared to present their findings in a five-minute presentation. Please prepare slides for this within the next 25 minutes.

## Excursus: Two-way door decisions

> Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. *Jeff Bezos, 2015 Letter to the shareholders*

:::notes
A **two-way door decision** is a concept popularized by Jeff Bezos, referring to decisions that are easily reversible. If you make a two-way door decision and it turns out to be wrong, you can simply “walk back through the door” and return to your previous state without significant consequences.

**Implications for strategic management:**

- **Flexibility and agility:** Two-way door decisions allow organizations to be more flexible and agile. Since these decisions can be reversed, they encourage experimentation and innovation without the fear of long-term negative impacts.
- **Speed of decision-making:** These decisions can be made quickly, enabling faster responses to market changes and opportunities. This can be a significant competitive advantage in dynamic industries.
- **Risk management:** By distinguishing between one-way (irreversible) and two-way (reversible) decisions, companies can allocate resources and attention more effectively. Critical, irreversible decisions can be given the thorough analysis they require, while reversible decisions can be made swiftly.
- **Empowerment:** employees can be empowered to make two-way door decisions on their own, fostering a culture of trust and autonomy. This can lead to higher job satisfaction and innovation.

The concept relates well to the idea of **incremental decision-making**, which involves making decisions through small, manageable steps rather than large, irreversible changes. This approach allows organizations to test and adjust their strategies incrementally, reducing the risk of significant failures.

# EFE matrix {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Purpose

**An External Factor Evaluation (EFE) matrix** allows strategists to summarize and evaluate economic, social, cultural, demographic, environmental, political, governmental, legal, technological, and competitive information.

. . .

The EFE matrix shows **how the organization responds** to existing opportunities and threats in its industries. Or, in other words, how the firm's existing strategies effectively take advantage of existing opportunities and minimize the potential adverse effects of external threats.

## Development

The following steps should be taken in order to create a EFE matrix:

:::incremental
1. List the key external factors (grouped by opportunities and threats).
2. Assign a weighting to the factors (on a scale of 0-100%).
3. Rate the effectiveness of the current strategies on a scale of 1-4.
4. Multiply the weight by the rating.
5. Sum the weighted scores.
:::

. . .

A total weighted score of 4.0 indicates that the organization is responding in an outstanding way to existing threats and opportunities in the industry.
