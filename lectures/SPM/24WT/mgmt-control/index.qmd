> What gets measured gets managed — even when it’s pointless to measure and manage it, and even if it harms the purpose of the organisation to do so. *Simon Caulkin, management editor of the Guardian summarizing @ridgway1956dysfunctional*
:::

:::notes
The saying "what gets measured gets managed" is often thought to be from Peter Drucker, a management expert. But in fact, Drucker never said it. We know that even in 1956, this "what gets measured gets managed" idea had some major flaws. In his paper “Dysfunctional Consequences of Performance Measurements” @ridgway1956dysfunctional already concluded that not everything that matters can be measured and not everything that we can measure matters.

## Reflection {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

Form small groups and engage in a discussion of the findings from the reading by Chakravarthy (2016) on the measurement of strategic performance, addressing the following questions: 

1. What are the difficulties encountered when attempting to accurately measure strategic performance?
2. Why are traditional financial metrics inadequate for capturing the strategic impact of various strategic initiatives and decisions?
3. How can the quality of a firm's adaptation be evaluated?
4. How should strategic performance be evaluated in accordance with the findings of the study?

In addition, examine the most recent Annual Review of the NVIDIA cooperation and assess its financial performance, as well as its slack resources and uses.

![@anthony2014management's perspective on management control](images/management-control.svg){#fig-managementControl}

- **Organization structure** specifies the roles, reporting relationships, and division of - responsibilities that shape the decision-making within an organization.
- **Human resource management** is the selection, training, evaluation, promotion, and termination of employees so as to develop the knowledge and skills required to execute organizational strategy.
- **Culture** refers to a set of common beliefs, attitudes, and norms that explicitly or implicitly guide managerial actions.

![Formal management control system [@anthony2014management, p. 105]](images/mcs.svg){#fig-mangementControlSystem}

Management control’s task is the implementation of the set organizational strategies, which means that divergences have to be controlled. Thus, MCS are defined as “[...] system[s] used by
management to control the activities of an organization is called management control
system” [@anthony2014management, p. 17].

Such traditional management control approaches often focus on top-down command and control mechanisms, where authority and decision-making are centralized at the top levels of the organization. The emphasis is on planning, setting targets, monitoring performance, and taking corrective actions if necessary. The control mechanisms are typically based on formal rules, procedures, and hierarchical structures.

# Planning hierarchies {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Four hierarchies

::: {.r-stack .html-hidden}

![&nbsp;](images/planningHierarchies.svg){.fragment height="420"}

:::

:::notes
@mintzberg2000rise structures traditional planning into two domains—performance control and action planning.

**Performance control** sets general performance standards (i.e., the desired output) over a period of time, without specifying any particular actions. The aim is to regulate the overall results of a given unit (i.e., standardizing outputs). Objectives, budgets, operating plans and other general standards are set for the unit, and its performance is later measured against these standards and the results fed back up the hierarchy.

- *Budgets* allocate resources to different parts of the organization. They are essential for translating strategic plans into actionable financial plans, ensuring that resources are available to achieve the set objectives.
- *Objectives* are the broad goals that an organization aims to achieve. Objectives provide a sense of direction and purpose, guiding the overall strategy.

**Action planning** is about making decisions about specific actions – things like marketing new products, building new factories or selling old machines. Some of the actions can be done by one unit, but others need to be done across different units. Because it's about making specific decisions, action planning isn't a pure form of standardising outputs. It's somewhere between that and standardising work processes.

- *Strategies* are the specific plans or courses of action designed to achieve the objectives. They outline how the organization intends to compete in the market and achieve its goals.
- *Programs* are the detailed steps or initiatives that implement the strategies. They include specific projects, timelines, and responsibilities to ensure that the strategies are executed effectively.

So whereas performance control says, "Increase sales by 10 percent this year [in any way you care to]", action planning says, "Do it by introducing blue widgets". 

The diagram in @fig-hierarchies explains how performance control and action planning work. The arrows in the diagram go in both directions, showing that performance control can happen in two ways. The first way is top-down, where objectives set by top management become more detailed as they move down the hierarchy. The second way is bottom-up, where lower-level units set their own performance standards. These standards are then combined as they move up the hierarchy and eventually become overall objectives for the entire organization at the top level.

In real-world practice, the performance control system is likely to operate not just as a pure top-down or bottom-up process, but as a combination of both. Some performance standards are detailed by top management and trickle down the hierarchy, while others are proposed by employees and aggregate up. At each level, managers try to set standards for their teams, and employees may suggest less strict ones. Through this negotiation process, a mix of composite and detailed performance standards emerges at all levels of the organization.

The action planning system primarily follows a top-down approach. In theory, it starts with strategic planning, where the organization evaluates its strengths and weaknesses based on environmental trends. It then creates a comprehensive set of strategies for the future. These strategies are translated into programs, which involve specific capital projects (e.g., launching a new product line and constructing a new factory) or operating projects (i.e., projects where costs are not capitalized typically evolving around enhancing and streamlining existing operations such as developing a marketing campaign). These programs are further detailed and scheduled, eventually becoming specific operating specifications that prompt direct actions.

@mintzberg2000rise argues that these hierarchies often operate independently rather than in a cohesive, integrated manner. This separation can lead to misalignment and inefficiencies within the organization.

![Four planning hierarchies according to @mintzberg2000rise](images/planningHierarchies.svg){#fig-hierarchies}


Strategic planning procceses move through the planning hierarchies. As a result of strategic planning, objectives are set, strategies developed, budgets created, and programs implemented. However, the focus and approach differ. @mintzberg2000rise identifies three main types of strategic planning:

- **Conventional atrategic planning** emphasizes comprehensive, long-term planning.
- **Numbers game** focuses on achieving specific numerical targets.
- **Capital budgeting** prioritizes financial returns and efficient resource allocation.
:::

## Conventional strategic planning

![Conventional strategic planning according to @mintzberg2000rise](images/planning-1.svg){#fig-planning_1}

:::notes
This approach involves a formalized process where organizations attempt to predict the future and develop detailed plans to achieve their strategic goals. It typically includes extensive data analysis, forecasting, and the creation of comprehensive strategic plans. @mintzberg2000rise criticizes this method for being too rigid and often disconnected from the realities of day-to-day operations.

- In this process, organizations start by setting broad, long-term **objectives** based on extensive data analysis and forecasting.
- Detailed strategic plans are developed to achieve these **objectives.** This involves identifying specific actions and initiatives that align with the overall goals.
- Financial resources are allocated to support the **strategic plans**. Budgets are created to ensure that the necessary funds are available for each strategic initiative.
- The strategies are broken down into specific **programs and projects**. These programs include detailed steps, timelines, and responsibilities to ensure effective implementation.
:::

## Strategic planning as a “numbers game”

![Strategic planning as a “numbers game” according to @mintzberg2000rise](images/planning-2.svg){#fig-planning_2}

:::notes
In this process, strategic planning becomes more about meeting numerical targets and less about genuine strategic thinking. Organizations focus on setting and achieving specific financial or performance metrics, often driven by short-term goals. This approach can lead to a narrow focus on quantitative measures, potentially neglecting qualitative aspects and long-term strategic vision. @mintzberg2000rise refers to this as the *numbers game* and criticizes it for being a "ritualistic strategy formation" that hinders real strategic change. Characteristics include being top-down, driven by numbers, and formalistic.

- The focus is on setting specific numerical targets, often driven by short-term **goals** and performance metrics.
- **Strategies** are developed with the primary aim of meeting these numerical targets. This can sometimes lead to a narrow focus on achieving specific metrics.
- **Budgets** are aligned with the numerical targets, ensuring that resources are allocated to meet the set performance metrics.
- **Programs and projects** are designed to achieve the numerical targets. These programs are often closely monitored to ensure they meet the specified metrics.
:::

## Capital budgeting as ad hoc control

![Capital budgeting as ad hoc control](images/planning-3.svg){#fig-planning_3}


:::notes
This approach is on the action planning side of the diagram. It is characterized by being bottom-up driven and more ad-hoc than planned. Capital budgeting involves allocating financial resources to various projects and initiatives based on their expected returns. It is a more financially driven approach, where strategic decisions are heavily influenced by capital investment considerations. While it ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, it can sometimes overlook broader strategic objectives and the need for flexibility and adaptability. 

- Objectives are often financially driven, focusing on maximizing returns on investment.
- Strategies are developed based on capital investment considerations. The focus is on identifying projects and initiatives that offer the best financial returns.
- Budgets play a central role in this process. Financial resources are allocated based on the expected returns of different projects and initiatives.
- Programs are designed to implement the strategies, with a strong emphasis on financial efficiency and return on investment.

# Performance measurement frameworks {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Overview

:::large
[Du Pont Pyramid,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Tableau du Bord,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Balanced Scorecard,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Performance Pyramid,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and Performance Prism.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

:::notes
- The **Du Pont Pyramid** focuses on analyzing return on investment (ROI) by breaking it down into key financial ratios. It examines profitability through the relationships between net income, sales, and asset turnover. The framework is useful for understanding the drivers of financial performance.
- A **Tableau du Bord** (a French term for "dashboard") provides a comprehensive approach to performance measurement. It encompasses both financial and non-financial metrics, presenting a holistic view of organizational performance. This framework is particularly useful for monitoring and managing various aspects of performance in a visually intuitive manner.
- The **Balanced Scorecard** is a strategic performance measurement framework that takes a balanced approach by considering multiple perspectives. It includes financial metrics along with customer satisfaction, internal processes, and learning and growth. This framework is valuable for aligning organizational activities with the overall strategy and ensuring a balanced assessment of performance.
- The **Performance Pyramid** offers a hierarchical representation of performance metrics, starting from financial indicators at the top and extending to operational metrics at the base. This framework organizes metrics into different levels based on their strategic relevance and impact. It provides a structured approach to performance measurement with a clear linkage to strategic goals.
- The **Performance Prism** is a holistic framework that goes beyond traditional measures by considering stakeholders and their interests. It incorporates key elements such as stakeholders, strategies, processes, capabilities, and stakeholder satisfaction. This framework is valuable for providing a broader perspective on performance and assessing the impact on various stakeholders.

Each framework offers a unique perspective on performance measurement. A combination of these frameworks may provide a more comprehensive understanding of performance.

## Group work {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

Form small groups of 3 to 4 students, take 15 minutes to do a research on one of the frameworks and to prepare a short presentation (5 minutes) that summarizes the key-tenets of the framework.

Prepare yourself to present your insights.

## Conclusion

The frameworks reflect key ideas to today's understanding of performance measurement system design:

:::incremental
- Inclusion of non-financial and financial metrics
- Creating a balanced set of multidimensional measures
- Identifying trade-offs between measures
- Include a mix of historical or lagged indicators and predictive measures
- Linking measures in terms of a cascading system and means-ends relationships
- Linking measures and targets with actions
- Inclusion of internal (e.g. costs, quality) and external perspectives (e.g. competitiveness)
- The integration of multiple stakeholders
- The dynamics of performance measurement systems over time (with changing priorities and strategic focus)
