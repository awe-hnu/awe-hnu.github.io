## External audit

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
Scanning the [**environment**]{.fragment .highlight-blue} to identify [**key variables**]{.fragment .highlight-blue} so that strategies can be formulated to take advantage of [**the opportunities**]{.fragment .highlight-blue} and reduce the impacts of [**the threats**]{.fragment .strike}.
:::
::::

::: notes
The essence of strategy formulation is coping with competition. Competition is caused not only by other players, but also by the broader environment [@mintzberg2014strategy]. The external strategic management audit focuses on identifying and evaluating environmental trends and events beyond the control of a single firm [@david2016strategic].

The purpose of an external audit is to develop a **finite list** of opportunities that could benefit a firm as well as threats that should be avoided. The external audit is aimed at identifying **key variables** that offer actionable responses, not developing an exhaustive list of every possible factor.

Identifying and evaluating external opportunities and threats enables organizations to develop a clear mission, design strategies to achieve long-term objectives, and develop policies to achieve annual objectives.
:::

## PESTEL framework

External forces can be systematically analyzed using the PESTEL framework [@david2016strategic]:

#### Characteristics of key factors

When identifying and prioritizing key external factors in an external audit, make sure the factors selected are (1) specific (i.e., quantified to the extent possible); (2) actionable (i.e., meaningful in terms of having strategic implications); and (3) stated as external trends, events, or facts rather than as strategies the firm could pursue [@david2016strategic].

## Porter's Five-Forces Model

::: medium
The essence of strategy is **coping with competition**.
:::

::: fragment
Thus, in addition to the PESTEL forces, also **competitive forces** need to be analyzed.
:::

::::: html-hidden
:::: fragment
::: medium
Porter proposed a framework for [competitive analysis]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} of a specific industry based on [five basic forces]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} that determine the ultimate [profit potential]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} of that industry.
:::
::::
:::::

::: notes
Porter's Five-Forces Model of competitive analysis is a widely used approach for identifying **key competetive forces** and developing strategies in many industries [@porter1986competition].

According to @porter1986competition, the state of competition in an industry depends on five basic forces. The collective strength of these forces determines the ultimate profit potential of that industry. Knowledge/analysis of the underlying sources of competitive pressures provides the groundwork for effective strategic courses of action.

#### Threat of entry {visibility="hidden"}

New entrants bring new capacity, substantial resources and desire to gain market share. The seriousness depends on **barriers of entry:**

Six major sources of barriers to entry are:

1.  **Economies of scale**: Cost advantages from large-scale operations
2.  **Product differentiation**: Brand loyalty and switching costs\
3.  **Capital requirements**: Financial resources needed to compete
4.  **Cost disadvantages independent of size**: Access to raw materials, technology
5.  **Access to distribution channels**: Established distributor relationships
6.  **Government policy**: Regulations limiting or preventing entry

Deterrent factors:

-   Previous attacks on new entrants by incumbents
-   Substantial resources to fight back (cash, borrowing power, capacity)
-   Ability to cut prices to maintain market share
-   Industry-wide excess capacity and slow growth

#### Powerful suppliers and buyers {visibility="hidden"}

Suppliers are powerful when:

-   Dominated by few companies, more concentrated than buying industry
-   Products are unique, differentiated, or have high switching costs
-   Not obliged to contend with substitute products
-   Pose credible threat of forward integration
-   Industry is not important customer

Buyers are powerful when:

-   Concentrated or purchase in large volumes
-   Products purchased are standard/undifferentiated
-   Purchases represent significant fraction of buyer's costs
-   Earn low profits, creating incentive to lower costs
-   Industry's product unimportant to buyer's quality
-   Pose credible threat of backward integration

#### Substitute products {visibility="hidden"}

Substitute products limit industry potential by placing ceiling on prices. More attractive price-performance trade-off = greater impact on profitability.

Key substitutes are those subject to trends improving price-performance and produced by industries earning high profits.

#### Intensity of rivalry {visibility="hidden"}

Rivalry intensifies when:

-   Competitors numerous or roughly equal in size and power
-   Industry growth slow, precipitating market share fights
-   Products lack differentiation or switching costs
-   Fixed costs high or products perishable
-   Capacity augmented in large increments
-   Exit barriers high
-   Rivals diverse in strategies, origins, and 'personalities'

## Megatrends

:::: html-hidden
:::fragment
::: large
[Long-term, global trends]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}\
[that bring about fundamental changes and transformations]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}\
[in various domains]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}\
[and at multiple levels.]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}
:::
:::
::::

::: notes
The concept of megatrends refers to long-term, global, and transformative trends that significantly impact various aspects of society, economy, industries, and organizations. These trends are characterized by their sustained and pervasive influence over many years, often spanning decades.

**Key characteristics:**

-   **Long-term perspective:** unfold over 10-20+ years
-   **Global impact:** transcend geographical boundaries\
-   **Transformational effects:** bring fundamental changes in demographics, technology, environment, politics, culture
-   **Cross-industry relevance:** impact multiple industries and sectors
-   **Strategic implications:** must be considered in strategic planning processes
:::

### Examples

The [Zukunftsinstitut](https://www.zukunftsinstitut.de/dossier/megatrends/) identifies 12 long-term, transformative forces that impact all aspects of society, economy, and individual lives:

::::: html-midden

# Positioning {.headline-only}

## Porter's generic strategies

::::: html-hidden
::: medium
To gain competitive advantage, organizations\
can pursue **three generic strategies**:\
:::

::: medium
[**Cost Leadership:**]{.fragment .fade-in} [becoming lowest-cost producer]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[**Differentiation:**]{.fragment .fade-in} [unique products with distinct value]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[**Focus:**]{.fragment .fade-in} [targeting specific market segment or niche]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::::

::: notes
@porter1980competitive proposed three generic strategies that organizations can pursue to gain competitive advantage in their respective industries. These strategies are based on the scope of the target market and the competitive advantage sought.
:::

::: notes
### Cost leadership strategy {visibility="hidden"}

Focus on becoming lowest-cost producer in industry:

-   Achieve through economies of scale, efficient operations, cost-saving measures
-   Target broad market scope with competitive pricing
-   Maintain profitability while offering lower prices than competitors

**Risks:** Intense price competition, potential need to sacrifice quality/innovation

### Differentiation strategy {visibility="hidden"}

Offer unique products or services with distinct value:

-   Achieve through innovation, quality, branding, customer service
-   Target broad market willing to pay premium prices
-   Create products perceived as superior

**Risks:** Sustaining differentiation requires ongoing investment, vulnerability to imitation

### Focus strategy {visibility="hidden"}

Target specific market segment or niche:

-   Concentrate on serving unique needs better than competitors
-   Can be cost focus (lower prices within niche) or differentiation focus (specialized products)
-   Build strong relationships within targeted segment

**Risks:** Vulnerability to changes in chosen market, competition from larger players

### Stuck in the Middle {visibility="hidden"}

Inability to pursue one generic strategy effectively:

-   Cannot justify higher prices (lacks differentiation)
-   Lacks cost structure to compete on price
-   Struggles to attract customers and achieve competitive advantage
-   Demonstrates need for clear strategic focus and trade-offs
:::

## Ansoff's Growth Matrix

::::: html-hidden
::: medium
The Ansoff matrix provides **four growth strategies** based on existing or new products and markets:
:::

::: medium
[**Market penetration:**]{.fragment .fade-in} [existing products, existing markets]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}  [**Market development:**]{.fragment .fade-in} [existing products, new markets]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[**Product development:**]{.fragment .fade-in} [new products, existing markets]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[**Diversification:**]{.fragment .fade-in} [new products, new markets]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::::

::: notes
The Ansoff-matrix [@ansoff1965corporate] is a strategic planning framework that helps businesses determine growth strategies by examining their current and potential markets and products. The matrix groups growth strategies based on two main factors: products (what they offer) and markets (who they serve).
:::

::: notes
### Market penetration {visibility="hidden"}

Increase market share and sales within existing markets with existing products:

-   Focus on selling more to current customer base
-   Tactics include price adjustments, marketing campaigns, enhancing customer loyalty

**Consider when:** Markets not saturated, customer usage rates can increase, competitors' market shares declining, economies of scale offer advantages

**Example:** Coca-Cola using market penetration through increased marketing efforts and seasonal promotions

### Market development {visibility="hidden"}

Expand into new markets or customer segments with existing products:

-   Identify and enter new geographic regions or demographic segments
-   Leverage existing market knowledge and customer base

**Consider when:** New reliable distribution channels available, organization highly successful, untapped markets exist, excess production capacity available

**Example:** Starbucks expanding into Asia (China, India) with existing coffee products

### Product development {visibility="hidden"}

Create and introduce new products or services into existing markets:

-   Leverage existing market knowledge and customer relationships
-   May involve R&D efforts or technology acquisitions

**Consider when:** Products in maturity stage, rapid technological developments, competitors offer better products, strong R&D capabilities exist

**Example:** Apple introducing new iPhone, iPad, MacBook versions to existing customer base

### Diversification {visibility="hidden"}

Enter entirely new markets with new products or services:

-   Most ambitious and risky strategy
-   Can be related (limited connection) or unrelated (no connection) diversification

**Consider related diversification when:** Competing in slow-growth industry, adding related products enhances sales, strong management team exists

**Consider unrelated diversification when:** Competing in highly competitive industry, new products significantly increase revenue, financial synergy exists

**Example:** Amazon diversifying from e-commerce to cloud computing (AWS), entertainment (Prime Video), grocery retail (Whole Foods)
:::

## Blue ocean strategy

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
Create and capture value without intense competition by [**identifying uncontested market spaces**]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} through [**value innovation**]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}.
:::
::::

::: notes
Blue ocean strategy is a business strategy framework that encourages organizations to seek new and uncontested market spaces, where they can create and capture value without intense competition [@kim2005blue].

**Key concepts:**

-   **Blue ocean:** Uncharted waters free from competition
-   **Red ocean:** Saturated and highly competitive markets
-   **Value innovation:** Simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost

The strategy focuses on creating new demand rather than fighting over existing demand, making competition irrelevant by opening up new and uncontested market space.
:::

### Four actions framework

:::: html-hidden
Organizations should consider four key questions:

::: medium
[**Eliminate** factors well below industry standard]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[**Reduce** factors well below industry standard]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[**Raise** factors well above industry standard]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[**Create** factors industry never offered]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
:::
::::

::: notes
The four actions framework helps organizations break the value-cost trade-off and create blue ocean:

1.  **Eliminate:** What factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
2.  **Reduce:** What factors should be reduced well below the industry's standard?
3.  **Raise:** What factors should be raised well above the industry's standard?\
4.  **Create:** What factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

This framework forces companies to examine every factor of competition, guiding them to pursue both differentiation and low cost simultaneously.
:::

### Identifying blue oceans

:::::: html-hidden
::: medium
Organizations can explore [**six paths**]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to identify new market spaces and convert [**three tiers of noncustomers**]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}.
:::

::: fragment
**Six paths to blue oceans:** look across [industries,]{.fragment} [strategic groups,]{.fragment} [buyer groups,]{.fragment} [complementary offerings,]{.fragment} [functional/emotional appeal,]{.fragment} [and time.]{.fragment}
:::

::: fragment
**Three tiers of noncustomers:** [soon-to-be noncustomers,]{.fragment} [refusing noncustomers,]{.fragment} [and unexplored noncustomers.]{.fragment}
:::
::::::

::: notes
[**Six paths to blue oceans:**]{.h4}

1.  **Look across industries:** Identify alternatives serving similar functions
2.  **Look across strategic groups:** Analyze different strategic groups within industries\
3.  **Look across buyer groups:** Examine chain of buyers influencing purchasing
4.  **Look across complementary offerings:** Consider complementary products and services
5.  **Look across functional/emotional appeal:** Balance rational and emotional buyer appeals
6.  **Look across time:** Identify and leverage trends shaping the future

[**Three tiers of noncustomers:**]{.h4}

1.  **Soon-to-be noncustomers:** Currently dissatisfied, likely to leave if needs not addressed
2.  **Refusing noncustomers:** Consciously choose not to engage despite having alternatives\
3.  **Unexplored noncustomers:** Never considered as potential customers, fall outside traditional boundaries

By understanding and converting these noncustomers, organizations can unlock new sources of demand and create blue ocean opportunities.
:::

## Trade-offs

::::: html-hidden
Trade-offs are necessary to [secure strategic position]{.fragment .highlight-blue} against activities that are incompatible.

:::: fragment
::: medium
The essence of strategy is [choosing what not to do]{.fragment .highlight-blue} as much as choosing what to do.
:::
::::
:::::

::: notes
For instance, positioning trade-offs arise for three reasons [@porter1996strategy]:

1.  **Inconsistencies in image or reputation**: Different positions require different branding
2.  **Different configurations required**: Different positions need different product configurations, equipment, skills, management systems
3.  **Limits on coordination and control**: Internal limitations on managing multiple approaches

Positioning trade-offs are essential to strategy because they:

-   Create the need for choice and purposefully limit what company offers
-   Deter 'straddling' and 'repositioning' by competitors
-   Force organizations to make clear strategic commitments
-   Enable focus and resource concentration

### Two-way door decisions

> Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible —one-way doors— and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that —they are changeable, reversible— they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. *Jeff Bezos, 2015 Letter to the shareholders*

::: notes
A **two-way door decision** is a concept popularized by Jeff Bezos, referring to decisions that are easily reversible. If you make a two-way door decision and it turns out to be wrong, you can simply “walk back through the door” and return to your previous state without significant consequences.

**Implications for strategic management:**

-   **Flexibility and agility:** Two-way door decisions allow organizations to be more flexible and agile. Since these decisions can be reversed, they encourage experimentation and innovation without the fear of long-term negative impacts.
-   **Speed of decision-making:** These decisions can be made quickly, enabling faster responses to market changes and opportunities. This can be a significant competitive advantage in dynamic industries.
-   **Risk management:** By distinguishing between one-way (irreversible) and two-way (reversible) decisions, companies can allocate resources and attention more effectively. Critical, irreversible decisions can be given the thorough analysis they require, while reversible decisions can be made swiftly.
-   **Empowerment:** employees can be empowered to make two-way door decisions on their own, fostering a culture of trust and autonomy. This can lead to higher job satisfaction and innovation.

# Excursus: Climate Change {.headline-only .html-hidden .unlisted}

## Group exercise {.discussion-slide}

::: medium
Neo-ecology: climate change requires sustainable and environmental practices.
:::

Form groups of three to four students, discuss the reading material provided by @hallegatte2009strategies, and create a summary of the key findings concerning **the importance of climate change** for contemporary firms, **the difficulties** encountered when dealing with it, and **strategies for robust decision-making**. Additionally, reflect on the implications these findings have for strategic management.

Each group should be prepared to present their findings in a five-minute presentation. Please prepare slides for this within the next 25 minutes.

::: notes
Climate change represents a critical megatrend requiring strategic attention [@hallegatte2009strategies]:

**Strategic importance:**

-   Requires sustainable and environmental practices
-   Creates new business opportunities and risks
-   Influences regulatory environment and stakeholder expectations
-   Demands robust decision-making under high uncertainty

**Robust decision-making strategies:**

1.  **No-regret measures:** Beneficial regardless of climate scenario
2.  **Low-regret measures:** Low cost with potentially large benefits\
3.  **Flexible/adaptive measures:** Can be adjusted as conditions change
4.  **Synergistic measures:** Address multiple objectives simultaneously
5.  **Precautionary measures:** Minimize worst-case scenario impacts

**Two-way door decisions:** Climate strategies should often be reversible to allow adaptation as understanding improves
:::

# Key takeaways

-   **External audit** provides systematic approach to identifying opportunities and threats in the environment
-   **Five external forces** (economic, SCDE, political/legal, technological, competitive) must be analyzed for strategic relevance
-   **Megatrends** shape long-term strategic context and create both opportunities and threats over 10-20+ year periods
-   **Porter's Five Forces** help understand industry structure and competitive dynamics affecting profit potential
-   **Generic strategies** offer frameworks for finding effective positions in the marketg and achieving competitive advantage (e.g., Porter's generic strategies, Ansoff matrix, blue ocean strategy)
-   **Trade-offs** are essential — strategy is as much about choosing what not to do as choosing what to do
-   **Climate change** represents critical strategic factor requiring robust decision-making under uncertainty

# Review and consolidation {.scrollable}

The following questions are designed to review and consolidate what you have learned and are a good starting point for preparing for the exam.

::: smaller
-   Describe the nature and purpose of an external assessment in formulating strategies.
-   What is Porter’s Five-Forces Model and what is its relevance in formulating strategies?
-   What are (legal) key sources of information for identifying opportunities and threats?
-   Why is \[a megatrend\] considered as a megatrend? Justify your answer.
-   How have external factors resulted in a major overhaul to the traditional retail industry as we once knew it?
-   Describe how political elections can be an important external factor for companies to consider. Select an industry and reveal some key political factors impacting firms.
-   Explain how Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can represent a major threat or opportunity for a company in different industries.
-   Discuss the following statement: Major opportunities and threats usually result from an interaction among key environmental trends rather than from a single external event or factor.
-   Do you agree with Porter’s view that competitive positioning within an industry is a key determinant of competitive advantage(s)?
-   Explain the effects of [a generic strategy] on the value stick framework.
-   Why do anual reports often state external risk information in really vague terms; why should strategists avoid including such vagueness in external assessments (e.g., in developing an EFE Matrix)?
