# Reflection {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .discussion-slide}

Before we start: Any questions or comments regarding the competition and positioning concepts discussed last week?

# Learning objectives

After this section, you should have a solid understanding of

::: incremental
-   the nature and purpose of an internal audit in formulating strategies;
-   major internal factors that impact competitive advantage;
-   the tenets of the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities;
-   the construction and application of the Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) matrix;
-   how internal resources create sustainable competitive advantage.

# Internal perspective {.headline-only}

## Internal audit

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
Assessing a firm's [strengths and weaknesses]{.fragment .highlight-blue} so that strategies can be formulated that [capitalize on internal strengths]{.fragment .highlight-blue} and [overcome weaknesses]{.fragment .strike}.
:::
::::

::: notes
The internal audit focuses on identifying and evaluating a firm's strengths and weaknesses in the functional areas of business, including management, marketing, finance, accounting, production/operations, research and development (R&D), and management of IT/the digital [@david2016strategic].

All organizations have strengths and weaknesses in the functional areas of business. No enterprise is equally strong or weak in all areas. Internal strengths and weaknesses, coupled with external opportunities and threats provide the basics for strategic planning. Objectives and strategies are established with the intention of capitalizing on internal strengths and overcoming weaknesses.
:::

## Key resources

Key internal areas/resources an internal assessment should focus on:

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
[Tangible resources,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [intangible resources,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [organizational capabilities,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [competitive assets,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [knowledge management,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [strategic flexibility,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [technology]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [as well as culture & values.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

- Exclusive contracts: exclusive contracts or agreements that offer preferential treatment or access to key resources 
- Market position: the firm's position within its target markets and industry, including market share and market dominance

**Knowledge management:** 

- Knowledge repository: the firm's ability to capture, share, and apply knowledge effectively across the organization 
- Learning organization: culture of continuous learning, adaptation, and knowledge creation

**Strategic flexibility:** 

- Adaptability: the firm's ability to adapt to changing market conditions, competitive threats, and external disruptions 
- Resource mobility: ability to reallocate resources strategically to exploit emerging opportunities or address weaknesses

**Technological capabilities:**

## Excursus: culture

::: large
> Culture eats strategy for breakfast. *Peter Drucker, Management consultant, educator and author*
:::

::: fragment
::: html-hidden
The most brilliant strategies can fail if they are not congruent with the prevailing culture within an organization. Successful organizations, thus, **integrate culture and strategy**.
:::
:::

::: notes
The phrase conveys the idea that a company's culture, which includes its shared values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can have a more substantial influence on the organization's outcomes than its strategic plans or strategies [@drucker1988coming].

-   **An organization's culture influences how employees behave, make decisions, and interact with one another**. If a strategic plan contradicts cultural norms or values, employees are likely to prioritize cultural consistency over strategic alignment.
-   **Culture can either enable or constrain the execution of strategic initiatives.** A supportive culture aligns with the strategy, fosters commitment, and drives performance. Conversely, a culture that resists change or lacks alignment can hinder even the most well-conceived strategy.
-   **Leaders play a crucial role in shaping and aligning culture with strategy.** Effective leaders understand the culture's impact and work to foster a culture that supports the strategic vision.
-   **Successful organizations integrate culture and strategy.** They develop strategies that not only consider external market dynamics but also respect and leverage the existing culture.

**Implications** [@david2016strategic]: - Strategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive changes can take considerable time and effort - Political maneuvering consumes valuable time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some valuable employees - Political biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded in strategy choice decisions

# Resource-based view {.headline-only}

## Reading — key takeaways {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide}

Form small groups of *3–4 students* and discuss what you have learned about the *Resource-Based View (RBV)* from 
reading @peteraf1993cornerstones and clarify issues of understanding. Focus on following questions:

1. How can the RBV’s key tenets be summarized\
   (i.e., main concepts, definitions, and underlying logic).
2. What are key implications for strategic management?

## Key assumptions

::::fragment
:::large
The RBV contends that [internal resources]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} are critical for achieving and sustaining [competitive advantage]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, even more important than the environment.
:::
::::

::: notes
Understanding the sources of competitive advantages calls for an analysis of not only the company's environment (opportunities and threats), but its own/internal strengths and weaknesses as well [@barney1995looking].

This point is clearly highlighted when we consider the success achieved by companies such as WalMart, Southwest Airlines and Nucor Steel, despite unfavorable environments.

A firm's internal attributes – its resources and capabilities – include all the financial, physical, human and organisational assets used by a firm to develop, manufacture and deliver products/services to its customers.

Resources and capabilities that cannot be readily matched by competitors are referred to as **distinctive competencies**. 
:::

## VRIO framework

:::: html-hidden
::::fragment
:::large
To create [sustained competitive advantage]{.fragment .highlight-blue}, resources must be [valuable]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, [rare]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, [inimitable/non-substitutable]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, and [organizationally supported]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@barney1995looking].
:::
::::
::::

::: notes

#### The question of value {visibility=hidden}

Resources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm's ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues [@barney1995looking].

Managers need to check if the firm's resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats: - Managers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways

#### The question of rareness  {visibility=hidden}

Resources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage [@barney1995looking].

Therefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them: - If a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, it forms a source of competitive parity - Resources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage

#### The question of imitability {visibility=hidden}

Resources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes [@barney1995looking].

Thus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it: - If a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage - If competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage - Imitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources

#### The question of organization  {visibility=hidden}

The organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization [@barney1995looking].

Thus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities: - A firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage - The firm's complementary resources – formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant for a firm to realize competitive advantage - To create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation
:::

## Limits to competition

:::: html-hidden
::: large
@peteraf1993cornerstones identifies [ex-ante and ex-post limits]{.fragment .highlight-blue} to competition that are crucial for [sustaining competitive advantage]{.fragment .highlight-blue}.
:::
::::

::: notes
@peteraf1993cornerstones uses the terms *ex-post* and *ex-ante* to describe different types of limits to competition:

**Ex-post limits to competition** are barriers that protect competitive advantage *after* it's been established. They preserve the sustainability of rents (profits) by making it difficult for competitors to imitate or substitute resources and by preventing competitive forces from eroding the firm's advantage. Examples are patents, complex social relationships, and causal ambiguity that make it hard for competitors to replicate a successful firm's capabilities.

*Example:* A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug. Ex-post limits include patents making it legally difficult for competitors to produce the same drug, proprietary knowledge about formulation and manufacturing, strong brand loyalty among consumers and healthcare providers, and rigorous regulatory approvals that competitors would need to achieve.

**Ex-ante limits to competition** refer to barriers that exist *before* a firm establishes a superior position. These limits ensure that costs don't offset the potential benefits of a strategic position. They limit competition for a position before any firm has established it, prevent the costs of acquiring resources from consuming all future profits.

*Example:* A tech company acquiring a patent for groundbreaking technology. Ex-ante limits include information asymmetry (better information about patent value), first-mover advantage (acting quickly before others), and unique complementary assets that make the patent more valuable to them than to competitors.

Together, these limits ensure that firms can acquire resources at costs below their ultimate value (ex-ante) and maintain their competitive advantage once established (ex-post).

## Mini case: Salesforce {.discussion-slide}

:::fragment
In the early 2000s, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software was dominated by on-premise solutions like Siebel and SAP. Salesforce, founded in 1999, pioneered cloud-based CRM with its "No Software" mantra. By 2025, Salesforce controls approximately 23% of the global CRM market—more than its four largest competitors combined.
:::

:::fragment
Despite numerous competitors entering the cloud CRM space (Microsoft Dynamics, HubSpot, Zoho, Oracle), Salesforce has maintained market leadership for over two decades. The company grew from $1.3 billion in revenue (2010) to over $34 billion (2024).
:::

:::fragment
[Your task:]{.h4}

- Research Salesforce's resources and capabilities
- Identify 3-4 key resources/capabilities and analyze each using the VRIO framework
- What gave Salesforce an advantage before competition began? (*ex-ante limits*)
- What prevents competitors from imitating Salesforce now? (*ex-post limits*)
- Which resources provide temporary vs. sustained competitive advantage?

#### Solution hints

Salesforce pioneered cloud CRM in 1999, grew from $1.3B (2010) to $34B revenue (2024), and maintains 23% market share despite competition from Microsoft, Oracle, HubSpot, and Zoho.

[VRIO Analysis - Key Resources]{.h4}

**AppExchange ecosystem**

- **V**: 7,000+ apps create platform value, network effects, reduce switching costs
- **R**: Competitors have hundreds of apps vs. thousands; depth/maturity rare
- **I**: Path dependence (2005 launch = 20yr head start), social complexity (ISV relationships), time compression diseconomies, network effects make it extremely difficult to replicate
- **O**: Dedicated partner programs, revenue sharing, certification processes
- *Verdict: Most defensible resource; would take competitors 10-15 years to build equivalent*

**Multi-tenant architecture**

- **V**: Automatic upgrades, lower operational costs, rapid customization, economies of scale
- **R**: True multi-tenancy at enterprise scale is rare; 25+ years of refinement
- **I**: Architectural lock-in from 1999 decisions, causal ambiguity, legacy competitors face massive technical debt to switch
- **O**: Core to business model, entire R&D structured around it
- *Verdict: Extremely costly for existing competitors to imitate; new entrants could build from scratch*

**Trailhead learning platform**

- **V**: 6M+ users, creates trained workforce, builds community, reduces customer implementation costs
- **R**: Scale and gamification distinctive, but competitors (Microsoft Learn, HubSpot Academy) closing gap
- **I**: Moderate - concept replicable, but community culture and network effects harder to copy
- **O**: Integrated into sales, onboarding, certification programs
- *Verdict: Advantage narrowing; 3-5 years before competitive parity on platform (culture may last longer)*

**Customer success model**

- **V**: Reduces churn, increases LTV, drives >100% net retention
- **R**: No - widely adopted across SaaS industry
- **I**: No - easily copied, no IP protection, low barriers
- **O**: Yes at Salesforce, but this alone doesn't create advantage
- *Verdict: Once differentiated (2005-2010), now industry standard requirement*

[Ex-ante limits]{.h4}

- **Non-obvious insight**: Cloud CRM for enterprise was uncertain in 1999; competitors skeptical about security/customization
- **Resource position barriers**: No legacy tech debt or channel conflicts; clean-slate architecture while Oracle/SAP invested billions in on-premise
- **Founder resources**: Benioff's Oracle experience + Silicon Valley networks
- **Timing**: Dot-com era receptivity, SMB frustration with expensive implementations, improving bandwidth

[Ex-post limits ]{.h4}

- **Path dependence**: Architecture lock-in; 20-year ecosystem head start; customer data informing product development
- **Causal ambiguity**: Unclear which factors drive success; tacit organizational knowledge; complex resource interactions
- **Social complexity**: Ohana culture, Trailblazer community bonds, ISV trust relationships built over decades
- **Time compression diseconomies**: Can't buy ecosystem maturity or community trust faster with more spending
- **Switching costs**: Data migration complexity, user training, integration ecosystem, institutional knowledge
- **Network effects**: More customers → more apps → more value → more customers (virtuous cycle)
- **Economies of scale**: Multi-tenant per-customer costs decrease with growth

[Temporary vs. sustained advantages]{.h4}

**Sustained (10+ years)**

- AppExchange ecosystem - Strong network effects, path dependence, social complexity
- Multi-tenant architecture - Extreme path dependence, causal ambiguity
- Brand & trust - Social complexity, time-dependent (moderate threat from service issues)

**Temporary (1-5 years)**

- Trailhead - Concept imitable, first-mover advantage diminishing (3-5 years to parity)
- Product features - Copyable within 6-18 months; requires continuous innovation
- Sales/marketing excellence - Methodologies portable, execution imitable (2-4 years)
- Customer Success - Already at competitive parity

[Emerging threats to sustainability]{.h4}

- **Vertical specialists**: Purpose-built CRMs (Veeva pharma, Toast restaurants) better for narrow use cases
- **Low-code/no-code**: Airtable, Notion reduce "build vs. buy" barriers in SMB
- **AI disruption**: AI-native architectures could leapfrog legacy systems; autonomous agents may change CRM paradigm
- **Open-source**: SuiteCRM, Odoo create commoditization pressure
- **Decreasing switching costs**: Better migration tools, standardized APIs reduce lock-in over time

[Key RBV takeaways]{.h4}

1. **Resources need V AND R**: Customer Success valuable but common = parity; shows advantage erosion
2. **Multiple imitability sources**: Social complexity (ecosystem), path dependence (architecture), causal ambiguity (all)
3. **Ex-ante ≠ ex-post**: Before = uncertainty (didn't know cloud would work); after = isolating mechanisms (know it 
   works but can't copy)
4. **Dynamic competition**: 2005 advantages (CS model) now standard; continuous innovation required
5. **Resource combinations**: Ecosystem + training + community > individual parts
6. **RBV limits**: Doesn't explain resource acquisition; assumes resources primary (ignores positioning); backward-looking (hard to predict AI disruption)

[Deep dive]{.h4}

- If you were Microsoft, how would you compete given these isolating mechanisms?
- Which resource most vulnerable to AI disruption and why?
- Can resources be simultaneous strengths/weaknesses?

# Dynamic capabilities {.headline-only}

## Overview

::: medium
Dynamic capabilities refer to a firm's ability to [integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external resources]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to address [rapidly changing environments]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [[@teece1997dynamic].]{.smaller}
:::

::: notes
RBV emphasizes the assessment of internal resources and capabilities to identify those that can provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities play a critical role in adapting and reconfiguring these resources over time to maintain their competitiveness.

By developing dynamic capabilities, organizations can better navigate change and respond effectively to new challenges. They are thus **a source of sustainable competitive advantage**, allowing firms to continuously renew and adapt their strategies.
:::

## Core elements

[Sensing,]{.large}\
[(**identifying** and assessing opportunities)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[seizing,]{.large}\
[(mobilizing your resources to **capture** value from those opportunities)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[and transforming]{.large}\
[(**continuously renewing** the organization)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

::: notes
@teece1997dynamic concept of dynamic capabilities essentially says that what matters for business is corporate agility: the capacity to (1) sense and shape opportunities and threats, (2) seize opportunities, and (3) maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise's intangible and tangible assets.

**Sensing:** Dynamic capabilities begin with the ability to sense changes in the external environment, such as shifts in customer preferences or emerging market trends. This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.

**Seizing:** Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

**Reconfiguring:** In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization's structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation.

Dynamic capabilities reflect the evolutionary fitness of organizations, which describes how well an organization can adapt to its environment and maintain competitive advantage [@steininger2022dynamic].

## Example: Apple Inc.

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
Apple provides a compelling illustration of [dynamic capabilities in action]{.fragment .highlight-blue} through [sensing, seizing, and transforming]{.fragment .highlight-blue}.
:::
::::

::: notes
Apple Inc. provides a compelling illustration of dynamic capabilities in action:

-   **Sensing**: Apple constantly monitors consumer trends, technological advancements, and shifts in the global market. They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.
-   **Seizing**: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.
-   **Reconfiguring**: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple's app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.
:::

:::fragment
Apple's success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge.

IT plays multiple roles in dynamic capabilities:
as enabler, embedded component, outcome, and context [@steininger2022dynamic].

:::column-page-inset
![Nomological net of DC in IS research based on @steininger2022dynamic [p. 454]](images/dc.svg){#fig-dc}
:::

**IT as context:** IT shapes the context within which dynamic capabilities are developed and deployed. The digital environment creates a context that necessitates the development of dynamic capabilities to remain competitive. Environmental uncertainty and industry conditions are critical contextual factors that shape how organizations develop and deploy their capabilities.

**IT as an enabler of dynamic capabilities:** IT provides the tools and infrastructure necessary for developing dynamic capabilities. Advanced data analytics and cloud computing enable organizations to quickly process and analyze large volumes of data, facilitating better decision-making and faster responses to market changes.

**IT embedded in dynamic capabilities:** IT is integrated into the very fabric of dynamic capabilities. IT systems are embedded in processes such as supply chain management and customer relationship management, enhancing the organization's ability to sense and respond to changes.

**IT as an outcome of dynamic capabilities:** Dynamic capabilities can lead to the development and enhancement of IT capabilities. An organization that excels in innovation may develop new IT solutions or improve existing ones as a result of its dynamic capabilities.

[Key theoretical insight]{.h4}

This diagram illustrates that IT's relationship to dynamic capabilities is multifaceted:

- IT isn't simply a "tool" or "resource"—it can play multiple roles simultaneously
- IT enables capabilities (left side), but capabilities also create IT (right side)
- From external factor → tool → component → output shows deepening IT-organization fusion

[Practical implications]{.h4}

- Don't think of IT as just infrastructure (context/enabler view)
- Recognize when IT becomes inseparable from your competitive advantage (embedded view)
- Understand that developing new IT capabilities is itself a strategic outcome (outcome view)

# SWOT framework {.headline-only}

## Overview

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
The Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) framework integrates [internal and external analysis]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to develop [four types of strategies]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}.
:::
::::

::: notes
The environment reveals external opportunities and threats. The resource-based view emphasizes the significance of internal resources and capabilities in achieving competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities represent an organization's ability to adapt and reconfigure its resource base over time.

When combined, these concepts offer a comprehensive framework for strategic management. The SWOT framework offers a starting point to develop and think through a strategy, particularly four types of strategies:

-   **SO strategies** (strengths-opportunities — matching): using a firm's internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities
-   **WO strategies** (weaknesses-opportunities — conversion): improving internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities
-   **ST strategies** (strengths-threats — neutralization): using a firm's strengths to avoid or reduce the impact of external threats
-   **WT strategies** (weaknesses-threats — defense): defensive tactics directed at reducing internal weakness and avoiding external threats

**SO Strategies (Matching)**: Use internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities - Leverage core competencies to exploit market opportunities - Build on competitive advantages to capture growth potential

**WO Strategies (Conversion)**: Improve internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities - Address capability gaps to pursue opportunities - Use market opportunities to justify investments in weak areas

**ST Strategies (Neutralization)**: Use internal strengths to avoid or reduce impact of external threats - Leverage competitive advantages to defend against threats - Apply strengths to minimize vulnerability to external risks

**WT Strategies (Defense)**: Minimize internal weaknesses and avoid external threats - Defensive tactics to reduce exposure to threats - Consider divestiture or strategic restructuring
:::

## Process for SWOT development

Steps in using the SWOT framework:

::: incremental
1.  Perform an *external audit* to identify opportunities and threats
2.  Perform an *internal audit* to identify strengths and weaknesses
3.  Allocate internal and external factors in the matrix
4.  Review whether allocation to (one) box is correct
5.  Structure the points in each box (i.e. group under headline, structure in sub-levels)
6.  Review potential relevance (and disregard as appropriate)
7.  Test whether statement is true and quantify where possible
8.  Review, prioritize
9.  Develop strategies based on the analysis
:::

::: notes
The SWOT development process ensures systematic analysis: - External and internal audits provide comprehensive factor identification - Proper allocation ensures factors are placed in correct categories - Structuring and prioritizing focuses attention on most important factors - Testing and quantification adds rigor to the analysis - Strategy development translates analysis into actionable initiatives

Key questions for strategy development: - *How to leverage strengths to exploit opportunities?* - *How to address weaknesses to mitigate threats?* - *How to use strengths to neutralize threats?* - *How to convert weaknesses into strengths using opportunities?*

Building on the Five Forces analysis of the GenAI industry, now analyze ONE
company's strategic position using SWOT analysis.
:::

**Select ONE company**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google (DeepMind), or Mistral

1. Identify 3-4 key **strengths** (internal) that give your company competitive advantage
2. Identify 3-4 key **weaknesses** (internal) or limitations your company faces
3. Select 3-4 **opportunities** (external) in the environment that you could exploit (see Five Forces)
4. Select 3-4 **threats** (external) that could harm your company (see Five Forces)
5. Discuss which strategic combination (SO, WO, ST, WT) is most critical for your company:
6. Propose a specific strategic action for your chosen combination.

# Key takeaways
