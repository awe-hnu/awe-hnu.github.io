## Internal audit

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
Assessing a firm's [strengths and weaknesses]{.fragment .highlight-blue} so that strategies can be formulated that [capitalize on internal strengths]{.fragment .highlight-blue} and [overcome weaknesses]{.fragment .strike}.
:::
::::

::: notes
The internal audit focuses on identifying and evaluating a firm's strengths and weaknesses in the functional areas of business, including management, marketing, finance, accounting, production/operations, research and development (R&D), and management of IT/the digital [@david2016strategic].

All organizations have strengths and weaknesses in the functional areas of business. No enterprise is equally strong or weak in all areas. Internal strengths and weaknesses, coupled with external opportunities and threats provide the basics for strategic planning. Objectives and strategies are established with the intention of capitalizing on internal strengths and overcoming weaknesses.
:::

## Key resources

Key internal areas/resources an internal assessment should focus on:

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
[Tangible resources,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [intangible resources,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [organizational capabilities,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [competitive assets,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [knowledge management,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [strategic flexibility,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [technology]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [as well as culture & values.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

## Excursus: culture

::: large
> Culture eats strategy for breakfast. *Peter Drucker, Management consultant, educator and author*
:::

::: fragment
::: html-hidden
The most brilliant strategies can fail if they are not congruent with the prevailing culture within an organization. Successful organizations, thus, **integrate culture and strategy**.
:::
:::

::: notes
The phrase conveys the idea that a company's culture, which includes its shared values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can have a more substantial influence on the organization's outcomes than its strategic plans or strategies [@drucker1988coming].

-   **An organization's culture influences how employees behave, make decisions, and interact with one another**. If a strategic plan contradicts cultural norms or values, employees are likely to prioritize cultural consistency over strategic alignment.
-   **Culture can either enable or constrain the execution of strategic initiatives.** A supportive culture aligns with the strategy, fosters commitment, and drives performance. Conversely, a culture that resists change or lacks alignment can hinder even the most well-conceived strategy.
-   **Leaders play a crucial role in shaping and aligning culture with strategy.** Effective leaders understand the culture's impact and work to foster a culture that supports the strategic vision.
-   **Successful organizations integrate culture and strategy.** They develop strategies that not only consider external market dynamics but also respect and leverage the existing culture.

**Implications** [@david2016strategic]: - Strategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive changes can take considerable time and effort - Political maneuvering consumes valuable time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some valuable employees - Political biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded in strategy choice decisions

# Reading — key takeaways {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide}

Form small groups of *3–4 students* and discuss what you have learned about the *Resource-Based View (RBV)* from reading @peteraf1993cornerstones.

**Your task:**

1. Summarize the RBV’s key tenets — include the main concepts, definitions, and underlying logic.
2. Derive the key implications for strategic management — what does RBV mean for how firms should compete and organize?.
3. Prepare to present your findings in a short presentation.

# Resource-based view {.headline-only}

## Key assumptions

::::fragment
:::large
The RBV contends that [internal resources]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} are critical for achieving and sustaining [competitive advantage]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, even more important than the environment.
:::
::::

::: notes
Understanding the sources of competitive advantages calls for an analysis of not only the company's environment (opportunities and threats), but its own/internal strengths and weaknesses as well [@barney1995looking].

This point is clearly highlighted when we consider the success achieved by companies such as WalMart, Southwest Airlines and Nucor Steel, despite unfavorable environments.

A firm's internal attributes – its resources and capabilities – include all the financial, physical, human and organisational assets used by a firm to develop, manufacture and deliver products/services to its customers.

Resources and capabilities that cannot be readily matched by competitors are referred to as **distinctive competencies**. 
:::

## VRIO framework

:::: html-hidden
::::fragment
:::large
To create [sustained competitive advantage]{.fragment .highlight-blue}, resources must be [valuable]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, [rare]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, [inimitable/non-substitutable]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, and [organizationally supported]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@barney1995looking].
:::
::::
::::

::: notes

#### The question of value {visibility=hidden}

Resources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm's ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues [@barney1995looking].

Managers need to check if the firm's resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats: - Managers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways

#### The question of rareness  {visibility=hidden}

Resources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage [@barney1995looking].

Therefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them: - If a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, it forms a source of competitive parity - Resources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage

#### The question of imitability {visibility=hidden}

Resources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes [@barney1995looking].

Thus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it: - If a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage - If competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage - Imitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources

#### The question of organization  {visibility=hidden}

The organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization [@barney1995looking].

Thus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities: - A firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage - The firm's complementary resources – formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant for a firm to realize competitive advantage - To create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation
:::

## Limits to competition

:::: html-hidden
::: large
@peteraf1993cornerstones identifies [ex-ante and ex-post limits]{.fragment .highlight-blue} to competition that are crucial for [sustaining competitive advantage]{.fragment .highlight-blue}.
:::
::::

::: notes
@peteraf1993cornerstones uses the terms *ex-post* and *ex-ante* to describe different types of limits to competition:

**Ex-post limits to competition** are barriers that protect competitive advantage *after* it's been established. They preserve the sustainability of rents (profits) by making it difficult for competitors to imitate or substitute resources and by preventing competitive forces from eroding the firm's advantage. Examples are patents, complex social relationships, and causal ambiguity that make it hard for competitors to replicate a successful firm's capabilities.

*Example:* A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug. Ex-post limits include patents making it legally difficult for competitors to produce the same drug, proprietary knowledge about formulation and manufacturing, strong brand loyalty among consumers and healthcare providers, and rigorous regulatory approvals that competitors would need to achieve.

**Ex-ante limits to competition** refer to barriers that exist *before* a firm establishes a superior position. These limits ensure that costs don't offset the potential benefits of a strategic position. They limit competition for a position before any firm has established it, prevent the costs of acquiring resources from consuming all future profits.

*Example:* A tech company acquiring a patent for groundbreaking technology. Ex-ante limits include information asymmetry (better information about patent value), first-mover advantage (acting quickly before others), and unique complementary assets that make the patent more valuable to them than to competitors.

Together, these limits ensure that firms can acquire resources at costs below their ultimate value (ex-ante) and maintain their competitive advantage once established (ex-post).

# Dynamic capabilities {.headline-only}

## Overview

::: medium
Dynamic capabilities refer to a firm's ability to [integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external resources]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to address [rapidly changing environments]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [[@teece1997dynamic].]{.smaller}
:::

::: notes
RBV emphasizes the assessment of internal resources and capabilities to identify those that can provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities play a critical role in adapting and reconfiguring these resources over time to maintain their competitiveness.

By developing dynamic capabilities, organizations can better navigate change and respond effectively to new challenges. They are thus **a source of sustainable competitive advantage**, allowing firms to continuously renew and adapt their strategies.
:::

## Core elements

::: html-hidden
[Sensing,]{.large}\
[(identifying and assessing opportunities)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[seizing,]{.large}\
[(mobilizing your resources to capture value from those opportunities)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[and transforming]{.large}\
[(continuous renewal)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

::: notes
@teece1997dynamic concept of dynamic capabilities essentially says that what matters for business is corporate agility: the capacity to (1) sense and shape opportunities and threats, (2) seize opportunities, and (3) maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise's intangible and tangible assets.

**Sensing:** Dynamic capabilities begin with the ability to sense changes in the external environment, such as shifts in customer preferences or emerging market trends. This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.

**Seizing:** Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

**Reconfiguring:** In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization's structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation.

Dynamic capabilities reflect the evolutionary fitness of organizations, which describes how well an organization can adapt to its environment and maintain competitive advantage [@steininger2022dynamic].

## Example: Apple Inc.

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
Apple provides a compelling illustration of [dynamic capabilities in action]{.fragment .highlight-blue} through [sensing, seizing, and transforming]{.fragment .highlight-blue}.
:::
::::

::: notes
Apple Inc. provides a compelling illustration of dynamic capabilities in action:

-   **Sensing**: Apple constantly monitors consumer trends, technological advancements, and shifts in the global market. They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.
-   **Seizing**: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.
-   **Reconfiguring**: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple's app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.
:::

:::fragment
Apple's success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge.

:::column-page-inset
![Nomological net of DC in IS research based on @steininger2022dynamic [p. 454]](images/dc.svg){#fig-dc}
:::

**IT as an enabler of dynamic capabilities:** IT provides the tools and infrastructure necessary for developing dynamic capabilities. Advanced data analytics and cloud computing enable organizations to quickly process and analyze large volumes of data, facilitating better decision-making and faster responses to market changes.

**IT embedded in dynamic capabilities:** IT is integrated into the very fabric of dynamic capabilities. IT systems are embedded in processes such as supply chain management and customer relationship management, enhancing the organization's ability to sense and respond to changes.

**IT as an outcome of dynamic capabilities:** Dynamic capabilities can lead to the development and enhancement of IT capabilities. An organization that excels in innovation may develop new IT solutions or improve existing ones as a result of its dynamic capabilities.

**IT as context:** IT shapes the context within which dynamic capabilities are developed and deployed. The digital environment creates a context that necessitates the development of dynamic capabilities to remain competitive. Environmental uncertainty and industry conditions are critical contextual factors that shape how organizations develop and deploy their capabilities.

# SWOT framework {.headline-only}

## Overview

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
The **Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) framework** integrates [internal and external analysis]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to develop [four types of strategies]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}.
:::
::::

::: notes
The environment reveals external opportunities and threats. The resource-based view emphasizes the significance of internal resources and capabilities in achieving competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities represent an organization's ability to adapt and reconfigure its resource base over time.

When combined, these concepts offer a comprehensive framework for strategic management. The SWOT framework offers a starting point to develop and think through a strategy, particularly four types of strategies:

-   **SO strategies** (strengths-opportunities — matching): using a firm's internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities
-   **WO strategies** (weaknesses-opportunities — conversion): improving internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities
-   **ST strategies** (strengths-threats — neutralization): using a firm's strengths to avoid or reduce the impact of external threats
-   **WT strategies** (weaknesses-threats — defense): defensive tactics directed at reducing internal weakness and avoiding external threats

![SWOT matrix](images/SWOT.svg){#fig-SWOT}
:::

**SO Strategies (Matching)**: Use internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities - Leverage core competencies to exploit market opportunities - Build on competitive advantages to capture growth potential

**WO Strategies (Conversion)**: Improve internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities - Address capability gaps to pursue opportunities - Use market opportunities to justify investments in weak areas

**ST Strategies (Neutralization)**: Use internal strengths to avoid or reduce impact of external threats - Leverage competitive advantages to defend against threats - Apply strengths to minimize vulnerability to external risks

**WT Strategies (Defense)**: Minimize internal weaknesses and avoid external threats - Defensive tactics to reduce exposure to threats - Consider divestiture or strategic restructuring
:::

## Process for SWOT development

Steps in using the SWOT framework:

::: incremental
1.  Perform an *external audit* to identify opportunities and threats
2.  Perform an *internal audit* to identify strengths and weaknesses
3.  Allocate internal and external factors in the matrix
4.  Review whether allocation to (one) box is correct
5.  Structure the points in each box (i.e. group under headline, structure in sub-levels)
6.  Review potential relevance (and disregard as appropriate)
7.  Test whether statement is true and quantify where possible
8.  Review, prioritize
9.  Develop strategies based on the analysis
:::

::: notes
The SWOT development process ensures systematic analysis: - External and internal audits provide comprehensive factor identification - Proper allocation ensures factors are placed in correct categories - Structuring and prioritizing focuses attention on most important factors - Testing and quantification adds rigor to the analysis - Strategy development translates analysis into actionable initiatives

Key questions for strategy development: - *How to leverage strengths to exploit opportunities?* - *How to address weaknesses to mitigate threats?* - *How to use strengths to neutralize threats?* - *How to convert weaknesses into strengths using opportunities?*
:::
