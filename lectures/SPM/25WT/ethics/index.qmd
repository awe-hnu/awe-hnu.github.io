> If you have integrity, nothing else matters. If you don't have integrity, nothing else matters. *Alan Simpson, Institute for Business Ethics*
:::

:::notes
The quotes introduce two key themes we'll explore in this chapter: the nature of ethical behavior and the amplified consequences when organizations act unethically. Recent corporate scandals demonstrate how ethical failures can rapidly destroy decades of value creation, making ethics a critical strategic consideration rather than just a compliance issue.

:::notes
Ethics is the branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. The term comes from the Greek word 'ethos,' which means character.

Ethical theories reflect on what is morally good and how individuals ought to behave, offering guidance for making moral decisions in various contexts, including business situations.

In strategic management, ethics provides frameworks for evaluating the rightness or wrongness of strategic choices, not just their effectiveness or efficiency. This distinction is crucial because effective strategies that are ethically problematic can create long-term risks and undermine sustainable competitive advantage.

## Values and moral systems

[The right conduct]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} includes those [lines of actions that are desirable]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} in terms of [the objectives and moral values of our society]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@bowen1953social].

:::notes
The right conduct includes those lines of actions that are desirable in terms of the objectives and moral values of our society [@bowen1953social].

Key considerations for strategic management:

- Morality is an aspect of culture—different cultures have different moral systems
- Moral values also change over time
- Some moral values change slowly, over centuries
- Others change more quickly, needing just decades
- Catastrophic events may cause moral values to change abruptly

This temporal and cultural variation in moral systems creates complexity for multinational organizations operating across different cultural contexts and time periods.

Research by @hofstede2010cultures demonstrates significant cultural variations in ethical values, while studies by @inglehart2018cultural show how values evolve within societies over time. This creates strategic challenges for global organizations that must navigate different ethical expectations across markets.

The COVID-19 pandemic provides a recent example of how external shocks can rapidly shift societal expectations regarding corporate responsibility, particularly around employee safety, community support, and stakeholder care.

Is there a moral (or social) responsibility for firms?
:::

If so, what is the extend and type of the responsibiliy?

## Corporate moral responsibility

::::: html-hidden
:::: medium
::: fragment
Firms function in [the context of a wider social environment]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, which imposes on them [certain moral demands and responsibilities]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@mintzberg2014strategy].

Business ethics is about doing the right thing in business.
:::
:::::

:::notes

Firms do not function in a vacuum. They function in the context of a (wider) social environment, which imposes on them certain moral demands and responsibilities [@mintzberg2014strategy].

Foundation of corporate responsibility:

- A company is a collection of human and social groupings
- General expectations regarding acceptable conduct underpins such groupings
- Values such as loyalty, credibility, diligence, cooperation, moral conduct are manifest in organisations

Research by @freeman2010stakeholder demonstrates that organizations exist within networks of relationships that create mutual obligations and expectations, making ethical behavior a strategic necessity rather than an optional add-on.

In essence: business ethics is about doing the right thing in business, but "right" is defined by the intersection of moral principles and stakeholder expectations within specific social and cultural contexts.
:::

## Business ethics

::::: html-hidden
:::: medium
::: fragment
Business ethics refers to [the principles of right and wrong conduct within organizations]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} that [guide decision making and behavior]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@david2016strategic].
:::
::::
:::::

:::notes
Business ethics refers to the principles of right and wrong conduct within organizations that guide decision making and behavior [@david2016strategic].

Business ethics is a form of *applied ethics* that deals with ethical principles and moral issues that arise in business environments. It encompasses all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the behavior of individuals and entire organizations.

Business ethics ensures that business practices, decisions, and operations adhere to ethical standards and contribute positively to society while fulfilling the company's objectives and obligations to stakeholders [@drucker1981business]. This is particularly important when *ethical dilemmas* occur. Ethical dilemma occurs when individuals or groups face challenging situations requiring choice between conflicting moral principles or values.

Research by @trevino2014managing shows that ethical dilemmas in business often involve conflicts between different stakeholder interests, short-term vs. long-term considerations, or competing ethical frameworks.

Understanding the foundations of ethics and values, why do these concepts become strategically relevant for organizations?

# Ethics x strategy {.headline-only}

## Strategic imperatives

Following concerns make the idea of an ethical strategy relevant:

:::incremental
- The concept of ethics and morals applies to corporations just as it applies to individuals
- The question of doing right is not easy in complex organizational contexts
- Ethical business practices can create "shared value" and **competetive advantage** [@porter2011creating]
- Wrong actions by companies can not only prove expensive (i.e., value destruction), but also cause **long-term damage**
- Organizations are difficult to turn once strategic direction is set
:::

:::notes
Recent examples of rapid value destruction through ethical failures such as Volkswagen's emissions scandal (2015) - over $30 billion in fines and settlements — and Facebook/Cambridge Analytica (2018) - lost $120 billion in market value in one day.

This demonstrates that ethical considerations are fundamental to strategic risk management and long-term value creation.

## Amplification effect

:::: medium
::: fragment
Strategic decisions affect [multiple stakeholders]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} across [extended time horizons]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} with [amplified consequences]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}.
:::
::::

:::fragment
This amplification effect makes organizational ethics both more complex and more critical than individual ethical decisions.
:::

:::notes
The transition from individual to organizational ethics involves several key amplification factors:

- Scale amplification: Organizations can affect thousands of employees, millions of customers, and entire communities through single strategic decisions.
- Time amplification: Strategic decisions create path dependencies that influence organizational behavior for years or decades.
- Complexity amplification: Organizations operate across multiple jurisdictions, cultures, and stakeholder groups with different ethical expectations.
- Visibility amplification: Organizational actions receive greater scrutiny from media, activists, and regulatory bodies than individual actions.
- This amplification makes ethical strategic management both more challenging and more important for long-term organizational success.
:::

## Cultural and value changes

Two current social and cultural changes create **ethical conflicts and dilemmas of strategic concern** [@mintzberg2014strategy]:

::::: html-hidden
[[Rapid technological development]{.medium}, e.g.]{.fragment}

:::fragment
- AI and algorithmic decision-making in business processes
- Data privacy and digital rights management
:::

[[Environmental changes]{.medium}, e.g.]{.fragment}

:::fragment
- Climate change and sustainability reporting requirements
- Supply chain transparency and human rights compliance
:::
:::::

:::notes
**Rapid technological development**

- New technology could harm people's personal integrity
- Fast pace leaves little time for moral reflection
- Creates unforeseen ethical challenges (AI, data privacy concerns)
- Generative AI raises questions about intellectual property, bias, and misinformation

Research by @floridi2019translating highlights how digital technologies create new ethical challenges that require proactive organizational responses.

**Environmental changes**

- Increased awareness of environmental issues and effects on future generations
- New moral and ethical concerns about sustainability
- Climate change as moral imperative for business action
- Increased stakeholder expectations for environmental responsibility

Studies by @eccles2014impact show that stakeholder expectations regarding environmental responsibility have fundamentally shifted, creating new strategic imperatives for organizations.

These changes create strategic imperatives for organizations to anticipate and prepare for ethical challenges ahead.

## Corporate Social Responsibility

::::: html-hidden
::: fragment
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has evolved from [consideration of issues beyond narrow requirements]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@davis1973case] to [societal expectations of organizations]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@carroll1979three] to [policies reflecting wider societal good]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@matten2008implicit].
:::
::::fragment
:::medium
> CSR is context-specific organizational actions and policies that take into account stakeholders' expectations and the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance. *@aguinis2012what*
:::

:::::

:::notes
Historical evolution of CSR definitions:

> The firm’s **consideration of, and response to**, issues beyond the narrow economic, technical, and legal requirements of the firm. *@davis1973case*

> The economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary **expectations** that society has of organizations at a given point in time. *@carroll1979three*

> The **policies** and practices of corporations that reflect business responsibility for some of the wider societal good. Yet the precise manifestation and direction of the responsibility lie at the discretion of the corporation. *@matten2008implicit*

This evolution shows increasing sophistication in understanding corporate social responsibility as both a response to societal expectations and a strategic choice by organizations.

More recently, research by @aguinis2012what provides a contemporary definition: "CSR is context-specific organizational actions and policies that take into account stakeholders' expectations and the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance."

## Core features

:::html-hidden
CSR captures three core features [@moon2014corporate]:

:::medium
Responsibilities of organizations
[**to society** (i.e., being accountable)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and **for society**  (i.e., compensation and value add)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[as well as **good business practices.**]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

:::notes
CSR definitions capture three core features [@moon2014corporate]:

1. **Responsibility to society** (being accountable): Organizations are accountable to societal stakeholders for their actions and impacts
2. **Responsibility for society** (compensating for negative impacts and adding to societal welfare): Organizations have obligations to contribute positively to society and mitigate negative effects
3. **Good business practices** (ethically, responsibly, and sustainably): Organizations should conduct business in ways that meet ethical, responsible, and sustainable standards

These features reflect the multi-dimensional nature of CSR as both a social obligation and a business strategy.

Research by @kramer2011creating emphasizes that the most effective CSR initiatives address social challenges that intersect with business opportunities, creating "shared value" for both society and the organization.

![The CSR pyramid [@carroll1991pyramid]](images/CSR-pyramid.svg){#fig-pyramid}

Carroll's CSR pyramid [@carroll1991pyramid] helps managers recognize that different types of obligations are in constant tension with each other and are not mutually exclusive. The model includes four levels:

**1. Economic responsibility** (required by society)

Core principle: Be profitable

- Generate high and consistent profitability
- Establish and maintain strong competitive position
- Operate at high efficiency level
- Maximize sales, minimize costs

Stakeholder impact: Primarily affects owners, shareholders, and employees

**2. Legal responsibility** (required by society)

Core principle: Obey all laws and regulations

- Operate consistently with government and legal expectations
- Show complete compliance with all regulations
- Adhere to laws governing business operations

Stakeholder impact: Affects owners, shareholders, employees, and consumers

**3. Ethical responsibility** (expected by society)

Core principle: Do what is right, fair, and just

- Meet expectations of social and ethical standards
- Adapt to new or developing ethical and moral standards
- Assert ethical leadership in industry and community

Stakeholder impact: Affects all stakeholder groups

*Ethical responsibilities change over time based on societal expectations*

**4. Philanthropic responsibility** (desired by society)

Core principle: Be a good corporate citizen

- Give to charitable organizations
- Provide community support programs
- Engage in voluntary social initiatives

*Stakeholder impact: Most affects the community*

Note: Left to managerial judgment as society provides no clear guidance

| Type of Responsibility               | Societal Expectation                        | Explanations                                                |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Economic responsibility              | *Required* of business by society           | Be profitable. Maximize sales, minimize costs               |
| Legal responsibility                 | *Required* of business by society           | Obey all laws, adhere to all regulations                    |
| Ethical responsibility               | *Expected* of business by society           | Do what is right, fair, and just. Assert ethical leadership |
| Philanthropic responsibility         | *Desired/expected* of business by society   | Be a good corporate citizen.                                |

: The levels of the CSR pyramid [@carroll1991pyramid] {#tbl-pyramid}

The pyramid structure suggests that economic and legal responsibilities form the foundation, with ethical and philanthropic responsibilities building upon them.

Recent research by @schwartz2003integrative has critiqued the hierarchical nature of the pyramid, arguing for a more integrated approach where all dimensions can be simultaneously important.

## CSR-performance relationship

::::: html-hidden
:::: medium
::: fragment
Studies suggest [a U-shaped relationship]{.fragment .highlight-blue} between social and financial performance: [moderate CSR can positively impact performance]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, but [excessive CSR may have diminishing returns]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@barnett2012does].
:::
::::
:::::

:::notes
Research by @barnett2012does suggests a U-shaped relationship between social and financial performance for many organizations:

Key insights:
- Moderate social responsibility can positively impact financial performance
- Excessive social responsibility might not necessarily lead to better financial results
- Need to find optimal level aligned with strategic goals and business context
- Strategic balance required between social responsibility and financial objectives

The authors emphasize that while moderate level of social responsibility can be associated with improved financial performance, pursuing excessive social responsibility might not always be conducive to improved financial outcomes. The findings call for strategic balance in integrating social responsibility into business practices.

This challenges both economists (who generally say CSR doesn't pay) and philanthropists (who say it always does) by suggesting the relationship is more nuanced and context-dependent.

Meta-analysis by @margolis2003misery examining 127 studies found a small but positive correlation between CSR and financial performance, while @orlitzky2003corporate found stronger relationships when CSR is strategically aligned with business capabilities.
:::

## Strategic investment decisions

The U-shaped relationship suggests organizations must make strategic choices about CSR investment levels:

::::html-hidden
:::medium
[**underinvestment risk** (missing stakeholder value creation opportunities)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out fragment-index=1}\
[[**optimal investment zone**]{.link-color} — CSR aligned with capabilities and stakeholder priorities]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=3}\
[**overinvestment risk** (resources diverted without proportional benefit)]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out fragment-index=2}
:::
::::

:::notes

**Underinvestment risk** 

Organizations that invest too little in CSR may miss opportunities for:

- Stakeholder value creation and loyalty building
- Competitive differentiation through responsible practices
- Risk mitigation and reputation protection
- Access to socially conscious consumers and investors

**Overinvestment risk** 

Excessive CSR investment may result in:

- Resource diversion from core business activities
- Diminishing returns on social investment
- Stakeholder skepticism about authenticity
- Competitive disadvantage if costs exceed benefits

**Optimal investment zone**

CSR initiatives should be:

- Aligned with organizational core competencies and capabilities
- Responsive to key stakeholder priorities and expectations
- Integrated with business strategy rather than peripheral add-ons
- Measurable in terms of both social and business impact

Organizations can identify their optimal investment level through stakeholder analysis, materiality assessments, and business case development for each CSR initiative.

# Implementation {.headline-only}

## Strategic response framework

:::html-hidden
Given that there are grounds for ethical strategic concerns, it is desirable to develop ethics sensitivity in the company:

::::medium
:::incremental
- Identify core values
- Teach employees about ethics
- Make moral views clear
- Plan for the future
:::
::::

:::

:::notes
Given that there are always grounds for ethical strategic concerns, it is desirable to develop ethics sensitivity in the company, and a routine to probe the general ethical climate of the firm [@mintzberg2014strategy].

Strategic response framework:

1. Identify core values: Establish clear organizational values and principles that guide decision-making
2. Teach employees about ethics: Educate employees about ethical behavior and decision-making processes
3. Make moral views clear: Communicate standards throughout organization with clear and consistent expression of moral convictions
4. Plan for the future: Anticipate and prepare for ethical challenges ahead, including possible cultural and value-related changes

Implementation mechanisms:

- Codes of conduct: Useful means of influencing ethical climate when properly implemented and visibly supported by management
- Cultural expression: Has strong unifying cultural effect and provides intellectual power to manage ethical conflicts
- Future preparation: Predict and prepare for cultural and value-related changes

:::

## Implementation framework

Practical framework for implementing ethical strategy:

:::incremental
- **Ethical audit integration:**\
  Include ethical factors in SWOT analysis and strategic reviews [@carroll2004managing]
- **Stakeholder impact assessment:**\
  Evaluate strategic options through comprehensive stakeholder lens [@harrison2010stakeholder]
- **Ethical risk management:**\
  Identify and mitigate ethical risks in strategy implementation [@kaplan2012managing]
- **Performance metrics:**\
  Develop KPIs balancing financial and ethical outcomes [@kaplan2001balanced]
- **Cultural alignment:**\
  Ensure organizational culture supports ethical strategy execution [@schein2010organizational]

## Ethics in practice

::::html-hidden

**Case example:** Patagonia's $10 million tax cut donation to environmental causes:

:::incremental
- Reinforced brand values and customer loyalty
- Attracted environmentally conscious employees  
- Generated positive media coverage worth millions
- Aligned with long-term business sustainability strategy
:::
::::

:::notes

Patagonia's $10 million tax cut donation to environmental causes illustrates how ethical decisions can create strategic value:

- **Customer value:** the tax cut donation reinforced Patagonia's environmental positioning, strengthening customer loyalty among environmentally conscious consumers willing to pay premium prices.
- **Employee value:** the tax cut donation attracted and retained employees who share environmental values, improving engagement and reducing turnover costs.
- **Media value:** the the tax cut donation generated extensive positive media coverage, providing marketing value far exceeding the $10 million donation.
- **Brand value:** the the tax cut donation strengthened Patagonia's authentic positioning as an environmental advocate, differentiating it from competitors perceived as "greenwashing."

Overall, The decision aligned with Patagonia's mission and long-term business sustainability strategy, as environmental degradation threatens outdoor recreation markets.

This example demonstrates how ethical decisions that appear costly in the short term can create significant strategic value when aligned with organizational purpose and stakeholder expectations.

Similar examples include Ben & Jerry's social activism, Interface Inc.'s Mission Zero environmental initiative, and Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan - all demonstrating strategic value creation through ethical positioning.

# Key takeaways

:::incremental
- **Ethics foundations** provide the basis for all business ethical decisions through understanding right and wrong conduct
- **Cultural and temporal variation** in moral systems creates complexity for global organizations
- **Strategic amplification** effects make organizational ethics critically important due to scale, time, complexity, and visibility
- **CSR pyramid** shows four responsibility levels with different societal expectations and business implications
- **U-shaped CSR relationship** requires strategic balance between underinvestment and overinvestment in social responsibility
- **Implementation framework** demands integration across audit processes, risk management, and cultural alignment
- **Value creation mechanisms** demonstrate how ethics enhance rather than constrain strategic performance across stakeholder relationships
