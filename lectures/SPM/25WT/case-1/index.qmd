# Learning objectives


After today’s session, you will be able to:

::: incremental
- apply competition frameworks to a real-world tech case;
- analyse deliberate and emergent strategy formation in practice;
- identify and assess resource-based advantages and capability building;
- evaluate organisational design choices in a scaling global company;
- and discuss ethical challenges in strategic decision-making.
:::

# Pre-class preparation

:::medium
You listened to the full [Meta: The Complete History & Strategy](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/meta) episode
:::

You prepared:

:::incremental
1. One key strategic decision
2. The lecture theme it best illustrates
3. One question for discussion
:::

# Roadmap for today

::: incremental
1. Warm-up and recap
2. Theme mapping
3. Group deep-dives
4. Cross-group synthesis
5. Trade-off debate
6. Final reflections
:::

:::fragment
We will make short breaks between the major blocks
:::

## Warm-up {.discussion-slide}

:::large
What stood out?
:::

:::incremental
- Form groups of four
- Share the **most surprising or counterintuitive** thing you learned from the Meta episode
- Explain **how it connects** to topics from previous classes
- Be rady to share your findings
:::

## Theme mapping: Episode highlights {.discussion-slide}

::: incremental
- Review key milestones from the Meta episode
- In pairs: connect **3–4 events** to the five themes
- Share at least one example with the class
:::

::: notes
**Timing:** 30 minutes  
- Use the **timestamp guide** in the Appendix as reference  
- Encourage students to go beyond “obvious” matches — some events touch multiple themes  
- After pair work, invite quick shares; note examples on the board for use in the next block
:::

## Group exercise: Deep dive into your assigned theme {.discussion-slide}

::: incremental
- Form **five theme groups**:
  - Competition & Positioning
  - Strategy Formation
  - Resources & Capabilities
  - Organization & Structure
  - Ethics & Values
- Identify **3–4 Meta decisions/events** for your theme
- Analyse:
  - Strategic logic
  - Theory connections
  - Strengths & risks
:::

::: notes
**Timing:** 50 minutes  
- 5 min: Assign groups and clarify task  
- 30 min: Group discussion and slide preparation  
- 15 min: Optional gallery walk or internal rehearsal  

**Facilitation tips:**  
- Circulate, prompt with episode examples if groups stall  
- Push for balance: identify both positive and negative outcomes  
- Emphasise linking to specific lecture concepts, not just telling the story
:::

---

## Cross-group synthesis: Connecting the dots {.discussion-slide}

::: incremental
- Each group presents findings (5–6 min)
- Note overlaps and tensions between themes
- Discuss where themes reinforce or conflict
:::

::: notes
**Timing:** 40 minutes  
- Use a shared board or digital doc to record connections live  
- Look for patterns: e.g., competitive moves driving ethical issues; resource strengths enabling organisational change  
- Keep Q&A short after each presentation — save extended debate for next block
:::

---

## Trade-off debate: Alternative histories {.discussion-slide}

::: incremental
- Discuss:
  - If Meta had emphasised *one* theme more, how might history differ?
  - Where did success in one theme create risks in another?
- Challenge each other’s views
:::

::: notes
**Timing:** 30 minutes  
- Frame as a constructive debate, not a right/wrong contest  
- Encourage references to specific moments in the podcast  
- Possible prompts:  
  - “Would stronger ethics focus have slowed competitive gains?”  
  - “Did resource overinvestment in VR weaken other capabilities?”
:::

---

## Reflection & key takeaways {.discussion-slide}

::: incremental
- Return to warm-up poll: Did your answer change?
- Key insight from each theme
- Applying this analysis to other companies
:::

::: notes
**Timing:** 15 minutes  
- Ask for 1–2 sentences from each group on their main insight  
- Encourage connections to other cases students know  
- Reinforce the integrative nature of strategy — themes rarely operate in isolation
