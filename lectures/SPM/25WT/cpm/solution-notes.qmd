## Discussion questions

### Profitability

*Which company is more profitable in percentage terms? What might explain the differences given both operate in AI?*

**OpenAI is more profitable** across most metrics with higher Gross Margin (43.2% vs 35.0%), ROA (3.0% vs 1.4%), and ROE (6.0% vs 2.2%). Operating and Net Margins are similar (both around 4-5%).

**Possible explanations:**

- **Scale advantages**: OpenAI's higher revenue enables better economies of scale in computing
- **Revenue mix**: ChatGPT consumer subscriptions may have higher margins than enterprise focus
- **Infrastructure efficiency**: Microsoft partnership may provide advantageous computing costs
- **Product maturity**: Established products command premium pricing
- **Development stage**: Anthropic may be investing more heavily in R&D relative to revenue



### Asset efficiency

*Which company uses its assets more efficiently? What does this suggest about their business models or stage of development?*

**OpenAI uses assets more efficiently** with Asset Turnover of 0.74 vs Anthropic's 0.36, generating nearly twice as much revenue per euro of assets.

**What this suggests:**

OpenAI:

- More mature business model with established revenue streams
- Better capacity utilization
- Closer to optimal operational scale

Anthropic:

- Earlier development stage with assets not yet fully productive
- May have raised significant capital ahead of revenue growth
- Possible overcapacity built for anticipated future demand
- Heavy investment in foundational research

OpenAI's consumer-focused approach may generate faster asset returns, while Anthropic's enterprise focus may require longer payback periods.


### Inventory

*Both companies hold GPU inventory. Which manages this more efficiently? What business factors might influence how much hardware inventory an AI company should maintain?*

**OpenAI manages GPU inventory more efficiently** with Inventory Turnover of 14.0 times vs 6.5 times, cycling through inventory twice as fast.

**Business factors influencing GPU inventory:**

Operational:

- Computational demand patterns (predictable vs. variable)
- Training vs. inference balance
- Cloud vs. owned infrastructure reliance

Strategic:

- GPU availability and supply chain lead times
- Technology refresh cycles and obsolescence risk
- Scaling plans and growth expectations

Financial:

- Capital availability for bulk purchasing
- Opportunity cost of tied-up capital
- Depreciation concerns as new generations emerge

Anthropic's lower turnover might indicate building capacity ahead of demand or more conservative planning.



### ROE

*If you invested €1 million in equity in each company, which would generate better returns based on ROE? What cautions should you consider?*

**OpenAI would generate better returns** with ROE of 6.0% vs 2.2% (€60,000 vs €22,000 annual return on €1M).

**Critical cautions:**

Leverage and sustainability:

- ROE can be inflated by high debt levels
- Historical returns may not predict future performance
- Current margins may not be sustainable as competition intensifies

Growth stage:

- Early-stage companies often suppress ROE through reinvestment
- Anthropic's lower ROE may reflect strategic growth prioritization
- Private valuations may be many multiples of book equity

Risk factors:

- ROE doesn't account for risk differences
- Significant intangible assets not captured in book value
- Should consider volatility, competitive positioning, and execution risk

Better analysis would include multi-year trends, market valuations, qualitative factors, and forward projections.


### Short-term obligations

*Which company appears better positioned to meet short-term obligations? Why is this important for AI companies?*

**Anthropic is better positioned** with Current Ratio of 2.25 vs 1.50 and Quick Ratio of 2.00 vs 1.31. Both are healthy, but Anthropic has a stronger cushion.

**Why liquidity is critical for AI companies:**

Operational demands:

- High fixed computing costs (cloud bills, infrastructure) due monthly regardless of revenue
- Cannot easily reduce costs without disrupting operations
- Revenue may be unpredictable in rapidly evolving market

Growth and competition:

- Cash burn during scaling (model training costs millions)
- Cannot afford service interruptions that drive customers to competitors
- Must continue investing to stay competitive

Financial flexibility:

- Private companies can't quickly access public markets
- Raising new funding rounds takes months
- Cloud providers may require significant deposits

OpenAI's 1.50 ratio is adequate but tighter. Anthropic's 2.25 provides significant safety margin, possibly reflecting recent funding or conservative management.



### R&D 

*AI companies typically have high R&D costs not fully captured in COGS. How might this affect the profitability ratios?*

**R&D treatment:** R&D costs appear as operating expenses (below gross profit), not in COGS.

*In COGS:* Direct computing for serving models, data acquisition  
*In operating expenses:* Research scientist salaries, experimental training, safety research

**Impact on ratios:**

Gross Margin appears artificially high:

- Both show healthy margins (43.2%, 35.0%)
- Doesn't reflect true cost of developing AI capabilities
- Makes AI companies look like software (high margins) rather than biotech (high R&D)

Operating Margin better reflects reality:

- Much lower (5.4%, 5.0%), showing true profitability challenge
- Includes R&D expenses
- Better metric for AI company comparison

ROA implications:

- R&D creates intangible assets (models) not capitalized
- Assets are understated, making returns appear lower
- Heavy R&D spending today creates competitive moats tomorrow

**Better approach:** Focus on operating margin as primary metric, assess R&D productivity, and understand that current expenses create future advantages.

### Scale

*These companies are scaling rapidly. How might growth stage affect the interpretation of ROA and Asset Turnover?*

**Growth stage distortions:**

Timing mismatches:

- Assets deployed before revenue materializes
- Infrastructure and teams built months before revenue impact
- Creates temporarily depressed metrics during scaling
- "J-curve" effect: metrics decline initially, then improve rapidly

Capacity building:

- OpenAI's higher Asset Turnover (0.74): More mature, operating near capacity
- Anthropic's lower turnover (0.36): Building capacity for 2-3x growth, not at steady-state

Different asset bases:

- Recent funding inflates assets relative to operations
- Cash sits as "unproductive" until deployed
- Makes metrics look worse for recently-funded companies

**Better analytical questions:**

Instead of "Is ROA high enough?":

- Is ROA improving quarter-over-quarter?
- What's the trajectory as infrastructure comes online?
- Are assets being deployed productively?

Instead of "Is Asset Turnover strong?":

- What's capacity utilization rate?
- How much growth runway do current assets support?
- What's expected turnover at maturity?

**Investment perspective:** Don't penalize low current metrics if intentional for growth. Look for operating leverage and compare to peers at similar stages.

### Revenue 

*OpenAI has partnership revenue from Microsoft, while Anthropic is developing enterprise solutions. How might different business models influence these financial ratios?*

**Business model characteristics:**

OpenAI:

- Consumer subscriptions (high volume, lower per-unit)
- API business (usage-based, scalable)
- Microsoft partnership (infrastructure advantages)

Anthropic:

- Enterprise solutions (lower volume, higher per-unit, longer sales cycles)
- API business (similar to OpenAI)
- Safety focus (appeals to regulated industries)

**Impact on ratios:**

Gross Margin (43.2% vs 35.0%):

- OpenAI's economies of scale and consumer mix drive higher margins
- Anthropic's enterprise support and customization increase COGS
- Enterprise deals require dedicated teams and implementations

Asset Turnover (0.74 vs 0.36):

- Self-service products generate revenue faster per asset
- Enterprise sales have 3-12 month cycles; infrastructure built before contracts close
- Expensive sales teams are assets not generating immediate returns

Liquidity (Anthropic stronger at 2.25 vs 1.50):

- Enterprise contracts often have milestone payments creating cash reserves
- Fewer, larger customers create lumpier but larger cash inflows
- May reflect capital raised for longer sales cycles

**Strategic trade-offs:**

*OpenAI advantages:* Faster growth, better asset utilization, viral adoption, lower CAC  
*OpenAI risks:* Higher churn, pricing pressure, commoditization

*Anthropic advantages:* Stickier customers, higher lifetime value, premium pricing  
*Anthropic risks:* Slower growth, higher CAC, execution complexity



### Intangible assets

*Both companies likely have significant intangible assets (models, datasets, talent) not fully reflected on balance sheets. How does this limitation affect your analysis?*

**Intangible assets not captured:**

Trained AI models:

- Development costs billions but expensed as R&D
- Not capitalized on balance sheet
- True "asset" value far exceeds book value

Proprietary datasets:

- Curated training data is competitive advantage
- Data partnerships and licenses not reflected
- Cleaning and curation efforts expensed immediately

Human capital:

- Top AI researchers worth millions in competitive value
- Team expertise and culture not quantified
- Retention risk not visible in financials

Brand and market position:

- "ChatGPT" brand recognition has enormous value
- First-mover advantages not captured
- Reputation in safety/ethics matters for enterprise sales

**How this affects analysis:**

Asset-based ratios (ROA, Asset Turnover) are misleading:

- Denominators (Total Assets) dramatically understated
- True ROA likely much higher than calculated
- Companies with better models show artificially low ratios

Equity value misrepresented:

- Book equity far below market value
- ROE doesn't reflect true return on capital invested
- Private valuations (billions) vs. book equity mismatch

Competitive position unclear:

- Can't assess "moat" strength from financials
- Quality differences between models not quantified
- Strategic advantages invisible

**Better analytical approach:**

*Supplement with qualitative assessment:*

- Model benchmark performance (MMLU, HumanEval scores)
- Research output (papers, citations, breakthroughs)
- Team quality (notable hires, retention rates)
- Market position indicators (API adoption, customer logos)

*Use market-based metrics:*

- Funding round valuations as proxy for true value
- Revenue multiples from comparable companies
- Cost per model capability improvement

*Focus on operating metrics:*

- Model performance per dollar spent
- Revenue per researcher/engineer
- Customer acquisition and retention rates
- Time-to-market for new capabilities

**Investment implication:** Traditional financial ratios significantly understate the value and competitive position of AI companies. Must combine quantitative financials with qualitative assessment of intangible assets and capabilities.
