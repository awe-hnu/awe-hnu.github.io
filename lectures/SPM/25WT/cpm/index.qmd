> What gets measured gets managed — even when it’s pointless to measure and manage it, and even if it harms the purpose of the organisation to do so. *Simon Caulkin, management editor of the Guardian summarizing @ridgway1956dysfunctional*
:::

::: notes
The saying "what gets measured gets managed" is often thought to be from Peter Drucker, a management expert. But in fact, Drucker never said it. We know that even in 1956, this "what gets measured gets managed" idea had some major flaws. In his paper “Dysfunctional Consequences of Performance Measurements” @ridgway1956dysfunctional already concluded that not everything that matters can be measured and not everything that we can measure matters.

## Concepts

::::::: html-hidden
:::: medium
::: fragment
[Corporate performance management (CPM)]{.link-color} is an organization-wide approach to steering results across both financial and non-financial dimensions.
:::
::::

::: fragment
It integrates [goals, measures, feedback, and learning]{.link-color} at individual, team, and enterprise levels to ensure strategy is executed effectively [@presti2021integrating].
:::

::: fragment
[Management control]{.link-color} is the subset of CPM concerned with processes by which managers influence other members of the organization to implement the organization's strategies [@anthony2007management].

::: notes
**Corporate Performance Management (CPM)** is an organization-wide approach to steering results across both financial and non-financial dimensions.\
It integrates **goals, measures, feedback, and learning** at individual, team, and enterprise levels to ensure strategy is executed effectively [@presti2021integrating]:

-   Broad system integrating **strategy execution**, **KPI frameworks** (e.g., BSC), **review meetings**, and **continuous improvement cycles**.\
-   Includes people/HR processes (goal setting, appraisals, recognition) and cultural enablers that drive sustained performance.

**Management control** is the subset of CPM concerned with processes by which managers influence other members of the organization to implement the organization's strategies [@anthony2007management]:

-   Core element within CPM that acts as the **bridge** between *strategy formulation* (“what we want to do”) and *task control* (“how we execute specific tasks”).\
-   Focuses on **measurement, analysis, and corrective action** to keep the organization aligned with strategic objectives.\
:::

## Theoretical foundations

:::: medium
::: fragment
Performance management bridges the [strategy–implementation gap]{.fragment .highlight-blue} by providing [systematic measurement]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, [behavioral incentives]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, and [feedback mechanisms]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} that ensure strategic objectives are achieved.
:::
::::

::: fragment
But these levers do not operate in isolation — their design must be grounded in an understanding of how **people**, **systems**, and **incentives** interact in real organizations.
:::

::: notes
Theories from economics, psychology, and systems thinking help us understand:

-   **Why** performance management is necessary\
-   **How** management control systems can be designed\
-   **What** factors influence their effectiveness
:::

## Agency theory

:::: medium
::: fragment
Agency theory explains how [goal conflicts]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} between principals and agents can be managed through [performance measurement]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} and [incentive design]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to align [self-interested behaviors]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} with [organizational objectives]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@eisenhardt1989agency].
:::
::::

::: incremental
-   **Problem:** Information asymmetry and moral hazard create misaligned interests.\
-   **Solutions:** Outcome-based contracts (pay for results) vs. behavior-based contracts (monitor actions) and risk sharing based on measurability & agent risk tolerance\
-   **Limits:** Overemphasis on extrinsic incentives; ignores intrinsic motivation.
:::

::: notes
Agency theory informs:

-   **KPI selection:** Choosing measurable, outcome-focused indicators (e.g., ROI, sales growth) when outputs are controllable; process KPIs (e.g., quality defect rate) when tasks are complex and harder to measure.\
-   **Incentive design:** Aligning bonus schemes or commission structures with strategic priorities.\
-   **Contracting:** Structuring SLAs, supplier scorecards, or internal service agreements to balance monitoring costs and performance risk.
:::

## Motivation theory

::::: html-hidden
:::: medium
::: fragment
Performance management effectiveness depends on [expectancy]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} (effort-performance link), [instrumentality]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} (performance-reward link), and [valence]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} (reward value) relationships [@porter1968managerial].
:::
::::
:::::

::: notes
**Expectancy theory** [@vroom1964work; @porter1968managerial] breaks motivation into three linked beliefs:

-   **Expectancy** – “If I put in effort, I can perform.” Influenced by skills, resources, and clarity of the task.\
-   **Instrumentality** – “If I perform, I will be rewarded.” Strengthened by transparent links between KPIs and rewards.\
-   **Valence** – “I value the reward.” Depends on personal preferences and circumstances.

Performance managenet should ensure that goals are achievable, the link between performance and reward is explicit, and rewards match what employees value.

**Goal-setting theory** [@locke1990theory] states that specific, challenging goals lead to better performance than vague or easy ones. Feedback during the process sustains motivation and enables adjustments to be made, while participation in goal setting can improve commitment.

Performance managenet should use measurable KPIs with clear targets; combine quantitative feedback (dashboards) with coaching conversations.

**Self-determination theory** [@deci1985intrinsic] highlights intrinsic drivers:

-   **Autonomy** – choice and control over how work is done.\
-   **Mastery** – opportunities to develop competence.\
-   **Purpose** – connection to meaningful organizational goals.\
-   **Recognition** – acknowledgment of contributions.

Performance managenet should balance extrinsic incentives (bonuses) with intrinsic enablers (job design, recognition programs).
:::

::: fragment
Motivation varies across individuals and cultures. Some respond strongly to monetary incentives, others to recognition or development opportunities. Performance management systems should thus allow customization within a consistent overall framework.
:::

## Political and power perspectives

:::: medium
::: fragment
Performance measurement systems are not neutral — they can [reinforce or challenge power structures]{.fragment .highlight-blue} by [legitimizing authority]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, [influencing resource allocation]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, and [framing organizational discourse]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@burchell1980roles; @hopwood1976accounting].
:::
::::

::: notes
Mechanisms of power in performance management:

- **Information as power**: Those who control measurement definitions, data access, and interpretation can shape decisions and priorities.
- **Framing effects**: Measures influence what is seen as “important” or “successful” — shifting discourse and perceptions.
- **Resource leverage**: Performance results are often tied to budget allocations, promotions, and strategic project approval.
-   **Political behavior**: Managers may lobby for favorable metrics, resist changes that reduce influence, or selectively report results.
- **Positive potential**: PM systems can also be used to empower marginalized voices and surface neglected priorities.

Political and power perspectives should inform:

- **Budgeting processes:** Anticipating that resource requests will be shaped by internal influence, not just ROI.
- **KPI governance:** Recognizing that metric definitions may be contested and reflect political compromises.
- **Portfolio steering:** Designing transparent criteria for project selection to reduce hidden agendas and favoritism.
:::

## Performance measurement dysfunctions

Common dysfunctions that can undermine performance management effectiveness:

::: incremental
-   **Tunnel vision:** Overemphasis on measured areas at expense of unmeasured aspects
-   **Gaming:** Manipulating measures rather than improving underlying performance
-   **Short-termism:** Focus on immediate results at expense of long-term value creation
-   **Suboptimization:** Local optimization that undermines overall organizational performance
-   **Rigidity:** Inability to adapt measures as circumstances change
:::

::: notes
Prevention mechanisms:

-   **Tunnel vision:** broader measure set; review.
-   **Gaming:** audits, qualitative checks.
-   **Short-termism:** include long-term capability KPIs.
-   **Suboptimization:** cross-functional/system KPIs.
-   **Rigidity:** periodic KPI governance.

# Financial reports {.headline-only}

::: notes
Before we design performance management systems, we must speak the language they rely on: accounting and finance.
:::

## Overview

:::: medium
::: fragment
Companies report performance through [three primary financial statements]{.link-color}: [Profit & Loss Statement,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [Balance Sheet, and]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [Cash Flow Statement.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
::::

::: fragment
Understanding these reports is essential for performance measurement as they provide the raw data for most financial performance indicators used in management control systems.
:::

## Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement

::: notes
The P&L or Income Statement shows revenues and expenses over a specified period (year, quarter)

-   "Bottom line" contains profit or loss for the period
-   Structure: Revenue - Costs = EBITDA - Depreciation = EBIT - Interest = EBT - Taxes = Net Income
-   Can be organized by expense type or multi-step format differentiating direct/indirect expenses
:::

[^1]: Earnings that are not part of the company’s main operating activities, but still come from business lines the company is keeping (e.g., rental income)

## Balance Sheet

::: notes
The Balance Sheet shows financial position in terms of assets and liabilities at a single point in time

-   Assets = Liabilities + Equity (fundamental accounting equation)
-   Current assets (cash, inventory, receivables) vs. Non-current assets (property, plant, equipment)
-   Current liabilities (short-term) vs. Non-current liabilities (long-term debt)
:::

::::: {.columns .inline}
::: {.column .smaller .fragment}
**Assets**

| Category | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Non-current (fixed) Assets** | Long-term assets, e.g., real estate, machines, patents/licences, and property, plant & equipment |
| **Inventories** | Finished goods, raw materials |
| **Accounts receivable** | Invoices to customers not yet paid |
| **Cash & cash equivalents** | Cash, balances of current bank accounts, sovereign bonds |

*Current assets* include inventories, accounts receivable, and cash & cash equivalents.
:::

::: {.column .smaller .fragment}
**Liabilities & Equity**

| Category | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Equity** | Money paid in by shareholders plus retained profits minus accumulated losses |
| **Non-current liabilities** | Long-term obligations, e.g., bonds, long-term bank loans |
| **Current liabilities** | Short-term obligations, e.g., open invoices from suppliers, bank overdraft |

*Equity* is the delta between the sum of all assets and the sum of all debt.\
*Debt* includes both non-current and current liabilities.
:::
:::::

## Cash Flow Statement

::: notes
The Cash Flow Statement shows changes in cash and cash equivalents over a specified period

-   Three categories: operating activities, investing activities, financing activities
-   Can be derived directly or indirectly from P&L and Balance Sheet changes
-   Critical for understanding actual cash generation vs. accounting profits
:::

Components of a Cash Flow Statement

::::::::: columns
:::: {.column .fragment width="33%"}
[**Cash from operating activities**]{.link-color}

::: smaller
Mainly revenues and cash flows due to expenditures (OPEX):

-   Cash **inflow** from revenues\
    *Shows in P&L as revenue (timing may differ)*
-   Cash **outflow** for salaries, materials, rent, etc.\
    *Shows in P&L as expenses (timing may differ)*
:::
::::

:::: {.column .fragment width="36%"}
[**Cash from investing activities**]{.link-color}

::: smaller
Mainly capital expenditures (CAPEX):

-   Cash **outflow** for investments in non-current assets\
    *Not in P&L; affects Balance Sheet*
-   Cash **inflow** when non-current assets are sold\
    *Non-current assets hit P&L only via depreciation*
:::
::::

:::: {.column .fragment width="31%"}
[**Cash from financing activities**]{.link-color}

::: smaller
Any cash flow due to financing:

-   Cash **outflow** for interest\
    *Expense in P&L*
-   Cash **outflow** for loan repayment\
    *Not in P&L; Balance Sheet only*
-   Cash **inflow** from new loans\
    *Balance Sheet only*
-   Cash **inflow** from financial investments\
    *Can be in P&L (non-operating income)*
:::
::::
:::::::::

::: fragment
Cash flows either show up in the **P&L** (as revenues or expenses, possibly in different periods)\
**or** appear as **changes in the Balance Sheet**.

#### Turnover vs day-based ratios

Turnover ratios (Table 1) express **frequency** (times per period).\
Days-based ratios (Table 2) express **duration** (average days).

Both describe the same reality from different angles:

-   High turnover ↔ low days outstanding (good)
-   Low turnover ↔ high days outstanding (needs improvement)

# Time value of money {.headline-only}

## Overview

Money has different values at different points in time due to its earning potential — a euro today is worth more than a euro tomorrow because of:

::: incremental
-   **Opportunity cost**: money can be invested and earn a return.
-   **Risk**: future cash flows may be uncertain.
-   **Inflation**: purchasing power decreases over time.
-   **Preference**: people prefer current consumption to future consumption.
:::

:::: fragment
::: medium
[Key idea:]{.link-color} to compare cash flows at different times, we convert them to a common basis — either all future values or all present values.
:::
::::

## Future value (FV)

The formula for calculating the future value (FV) from the present value (PV) is as follows:

$FV = PV \times (1 + i)^n$

::: smaller
-   $PV$ = present value\
-   $i$ = interest rate per period\
-   $n$ = number of periods
:::

**Example:**

FV of 1,000 € in 3 years given a 5% annual interest rate:\
$FV = 1000 \times (1 + .05)^3 = 1,157.63$

## Present value (PV)

Formula to discount the present value (PV) from a future value (FV) is as follows:

$PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + i)^n}$

::: smaller
-   $PV$ = present value\
-   $i$ = interest rate per period\
-   $n$ = number of periods
:::

**Example:**

PV of 1,000 received in 3 years given a 5% annual interest rate:\
$PV = \frac{1000}{(1.05)^3} = 863.84$

## Interest rates

There are two differnt interest rates being used:

-   **Nominal interest rate**: stated annual rate, not accounting for compounding frequency.
-   **Effective annual rate (EAR)**: accounts for intra-year compounding.

$EAR = \left( 1 + \frac{i_{nom}}{m} \right)^m - 1$

::: smaller
-   $i_{nom}$ = nominal annual interest rate\
-   $m$ = number of compounding periods per year
:::

**Example:**\
Nominal rate 12%, monthly compounding ($m = 12$):\
$EAR = (1 + 0.12/12)^{12} - 1 \approx 12.68\%$

## Annuities

::: medium
An annuity is a [series of equal payments]{.link-color} or receipts occurring at [regular intervals]{.link-color}.
:::

::: notes
In financial valuation, the concept is used to calculate the present and future value of cash flows, which is critical for making business decisions.
:::

**Future value of an annuity:**\
*What is the future value of a constant annual cash flow have at the end of the period?* $FV_{OA} = PMT \times \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i}$

**Present value of an annuity:**\
*What is the present value today of a future annual cash flow for multiple years?* $PV_{OA} = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}{i}$

::: smaller
$PMT$ = payment per period
:::

## Net Present Value (NPV)

::: medium
Net present value (NPV) is a financial metric used to [evaluate the profitability of an investment]{.link-color} or project.
:::

Steps:

1.  Estimate cash inflows and outflows over time.
2.  Chose a discount rate[^2] and discount each cash flow to present value.
3.  Sum present values — if positive, project adds value.

[^2]: The discount rate is the rate of return you could earn on an alternative investment with a similar level of risk. It's used to "discount" future cash flows back to their present-day value. A common discount rate is a company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

$NPV = \sum_{t=0}^n \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}$

::: smaller
-   $CF_t$ = cash flow in period $t$\
-   $r$ = discount rate
:::

## NPV example

What is the NPV of an investment with cash flows shown below if the Weigthed Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is 10%?

::: fragment
| Year    | Cash Flow (€) | Discount Factor (10%) | Present Value (€) |
|---------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 0       | -10,000       | 1.0000                | -10,000.00        |
| 1       | 3,000         | 0.9091                | 2,727.27          |
| 2       | 4,000         | 0.8264                | 3,305.79          |
| 3       | 5,000         | 0.7513                | 3,756.57          |
| **NPV** |               |                       | **-210.37**       |

: The economic value added by the investment calculated for the time $t_0$ as compared to an investment which returns exactly the WACC every year and has the same investment volume {#tbl-npv-example}

Decision: Since NPV \< 0, the project would **not** be accepted at a 10% WACC.

## Cost types

:::: medium
::: fragment
Understanding different cost types is essential for designing budgets, conducting variance analysis, and making informed resource allocation decisions within performance management systems.
:::
::::

:::html-hidden
::: incremental
- **Direct vs. indirect costs:** Traceable to specific products/services (*direct*) versus allocated overhead (*indirect*)
- **Fixed vs. variable costs:** Remain constant (*fixed*) versus change with activity levels (*variable*)
- **Standard costing:** Predetermined benchmarks for materials, labor, and overhead 
- **Activity-based costing (ABC):** allocates overhead using cost drivers rather than volume 
:::
:::

::: notes
**Direct vs. indirect**  

- *Direct*: Materials, direct labor — easily assigned to a cost object.  
- *Indirect*: Factory rent, administrative salaries — need allocation rules.  

Direct costs are often controllable by operational managers; indirect cost allocation impacts perceived profitability of products or units.

**Fixed vs. variable**  

- *Fixed*: Stay the same within a relevant range (e.g., rent, salaried staff).  
- *Variable*: Change with output (e.g., raw materials, piece-rate labor).  
- Many costs are *semi-variable* (e.g., utilities with base fee + usage).  

Understanding cost behavior is key for forecasting, flexible budgeting, and interpreting performance against targets.

**Standard costing**  

- Establishes *rate* and *usage* standards for inputs.  
- Variances (e.g., material price variance, labor efficiency variance) pinpoint performance issues.  

Standard costing supports responsibility-center evaluation and cost control.

**Activity-based costing (ABC)**  

Identifies activities, assigns resource costs to activities, and then to cost objects via drivers (e.g., setups, purchase orders).  

Improves decision-making on pricing, process improvement, and outsourcing.

::: callout-note
#### Example — activity-based costing in SaaS

- Annual cost of customer support team: €300,000  
- Total support tickets per year: 15,000 → cost driver rate = €20/ticket  
- Enterprise customers: 500 tickets/year → €10,000 support cost per enterprise client  
- SMB customers: 50 tickets/year → €1,000 support cost per SMB client

-   **Organization structure** specifies the roles, reporting relationships, and division of - responsibilities that shape the decision-making within an organization.
-   **Human resource management** is the selection, training, evaluation, promotion, and termination of employees so as to develop the knowledge and skills required to execute organizational strategy.
-   **Culture** refers to a set of common beliefs, attitudes, and norms that explicitly or implicitly guide managerial actions.

![Formal management control system [@anthony2014management, p. 105]](images/mcs.svg){#fig-mangementControlSystem}

Traditional management control approaches often focus on top-down command and control mechanisms, where authority and decision-making are centralized at the top levels of the organization. The emphasis is on planning, setting targets, monitoring performance, and taking corrective actions if necessary. The control mechanisms are typically based on formal rules, procedures, and hierarchical structures.

-   Strategy formulation (what to do) → Management control (ensure it happens) → Task control (do tasks right).
-   Mechanisms: org structure, HRM, culture, planning/measurement/feedback.
-   Process: plan → budget → measure → analyze → act.

## Planning and budgeting process

::::: html-hidden
:::: medium
::: fragment
The planning and budgeting cycle translates [strategic objectives]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} into [operational plans]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} through [resource allocation]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} and [performance targets]{.fragment .highlight-blue} that guide organizational action [@anthony2007management].
:::
::::
:::::

::: notes
**Strategic planning (3–5 years)**

-   Defines long-term direction, competitive positioning, and required capabilities.
-   Produces high-level targets and priorities that cascade into annual plans.
-   Sets the frame for capital investments, product/market focus, and talent needs.

**Operating budgets (annual)**

-   Translate strategy into detailed revenue, cost, and profit plans for responsibility centers (departments, business units).
-   Broken down by month or quarter to monitor seasonal effects and track progress.
-   Include both financial and operational measures.

**Typical budget components**

-   Revenue budget: Sales volumes × unit prices.
-   Production budget: Units to be produced, considering opening inventory and sales forecasts.
-   Expense budget: Operating costs by category (e.g., labor, materials, overhead).
-   Capital budget: Planned investments in assets, technology, or infrastructure.
-   Cash flow budget: Expected cash inflows and outflows to ensure liquidity.

**Functions of the planning & budgeting process**

-   Coordination: Aligns activities across functions and units.
-   Authorization: Provides spending limits and resource approvals.
-   Performance benchmark: Sets measurable targets against which actual results are compared.
-   Communication: Signals priorities and expectations throughout the organization.
-   Risk planning: Anticipates contingencies and resource needs under different scenarios.

**Types of budgeting approaches**

-   Annual budget: Fixed for the year; common but can become outdated in volatile environments.
-   Rolling budget: Updated regularly (e.g., quarterly) to maintain a forward-looking 12–18 month horizon.
-   Zero-based budget: Every expense must be justified each period, not just incremental changes.
-   Activity-based budget: Links costs to the activities that generate them, improving cost control.

**Modern CPM practices**

-   Rolling forecasts: Replace static annual targets with continuously updated projections based on latest data.
-   Driver-based planning: Links forecasts and budgets to key business drivers (e.g., sales pipeline, customer churn rate) for more responsive resource allocation.
-   Integration with performance management systems: Ensures that financial targets are consistent with KPI frameworks such as the Balanced Scorecard, reducing siloed planning and gaming behavior.

## Responsibility center design

Organizations structure accountability through different responsibility center types:

:::: html-hidden
::: medium
[[Cost centers]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="1"} focus on expense control]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out fragment-index=1}[, [revenue centers]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="2"} on sales generation]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out fragment-index=2}[, [profit centers]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="3"} on bottom-line results]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out fragment-index=3}[, and [investment centers]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index="4"} on return on invested capital [@anthony2007management].]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out fragment-index="4"}
:::
::::

::: notes
-   **Cost centers:** engineered vs discretionary; measure vs budget.
-   **Revenue centers:** sales & market share; limited cost control.
-   **Profit centers:** accountable for P&L; enables decentralization.
-   **Investment centers:** ROI/ROCE/EVA; highest autonomy.
-   **Design principles:** align responsibility with controllability; match measures to objectives; support structure & strategy.
:::

::: fragment
The choice of center type determines KPI sets and bonus formulas; e.g., ROI/EVA for investment centers versus margin or contribution for profit centers.

## Variance analysis

:::: medium
::: fragment
Variance analysis compares [actual results]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to [planned targets]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} to understand the [causes of performance deviations]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} and guide [corrective action]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@anthony2007management].
:::
::::

::: notes
**Purpose**  

- Identify and quantify **causal factors** behind differences between budgeted and actual results.  
- Provide actionable insight, not just variance reporting.  
- Support continuous improvement and learning loops in CPM.

**Approach** [@anthony2007management]:  

1. Identify the causal factor affecting profits (e.g., sales price, volume, cost of materials).  
2. Disaggregate the overall profit variance into these causal factors.  
3. Measure the profit impact of each factor individually.  
4. Apply ceteris paribus vary one factor at a time, holding others constant to isolate its effect.  
5. Layer complexity sequentially start with a simple commonsense breakdown, then refine as needed.  
6. Stop when complexity outweighs insight focus on factors with real decision value.

Many organizations perform variance analysis *monthly* at business unit and corporate level; some prefer *quarterly* for broader trends.

**Performance management perspective**  

Meeting the budget must not equal optimal performance — variances must be interpreted in context (market changes, strategic shifts).  

Sophisticated CPM uses variance analysis not only for *control* but also for *learning*:  

- Adjust forecasts and rolling budgets based on variance patterns.  
- Identify systemic issues (e.g., persistent unfavorable cost variances).  
- Feed insights into KPI governance to ensure measures remain relevant.

### Variance analysis disaggregration

:::notes
**Common variance breakdowns**  

- **Revenue variance**  
  - *Volume variance* – change due to actual units sold vs. budgeted.  
  - *Mix variance* – change due to the proportion of products/services sold.  
  - *Price variance* – change due to actual selling prices vs. budgeted.  
- **Expense variance**  
  - *Manufacturing expenses* – material cost, labor efficiency, overhead absorption.  
  - *Other expenses* – SG&A, marketing, R&D.

# Financial performance frameworks {.headline-only}

:::notes
Theories from economics, psychology, and organizational behavior identify the **drivers** of effective performance management. Frameworks operationalize these insights into **practical measurement systems** that guide resource allocation, align incentives, and support decision-making. They provide the **how** — structured approaches to measuring, analyzing, and improving performance.

## Overview

:::large
[Du Pont Pyramid,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Tableau du Bord,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Balanced Scorecard,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Performance Pyramid,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and Performance Prism.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

:::notes
- The **Du Pont Pyramid** focuses on analyzing return on investment (ROI) by breaking it down into key financial ratios. It examines profitability through the relationships between net income, sales, and asset turnover. The framework is useful for understanding the drivers of financial performance.
- A **Tableau du Bord** (a French term for "dashboard") provides a comprehensive approach to performance measurement. It encompasses both financial and non-financial metrics, presenting a holistic view of organizational performance. This framework is particularly useful for monitoring and managing various aspects of performance in a visually intuitive manner.
- The **Balanced Scorecard** is a strategic performance measurement framework that takes a balanced approach by considering multiple perspectives. It includes financial metrics along with customer satisfaction, internal processes, and learning and growth. This framework is valuable for aligning organizational activities with the overall strategy and ensuring a balanced assessment of performance.
- The **Performance Pyramid** offers a hierarchical representation of performance metrics, starting from financial indicators at the top and extending to operational metrics at the base. This framework organizes metrics into different levels based on their strategic relevance and impact. It provides a structured approach to performance measurement with a clear linkage to strategic goals.
- The **Performance Prism** is a holistic framework that goes beyond traditional measures by considering stakeholders and their interests. It incorporates key elements such as stakeholders, strategies, processes, capabilities, and stakeholder satisfaction. This framework is valuable for providing a broader perspective on performance and assessing the impact on various stakeholders.

Each framework offers a unique perspective on performance measurement. A combination of these frameworks may provide a more comprehensive understanding of performance.
