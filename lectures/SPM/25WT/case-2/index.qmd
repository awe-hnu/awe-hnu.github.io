# Introduction

:::medium
Strategic moves are only as good\
as their measurable results.
:::

:::fragment
Today we look at three major Meta strategic moves and use different CPM tools to measure and evaluate their performance.

Your tasks:

- **Choose & justify** the right performance measurement tool.  
- **Collect & use** public data (given links).  
- **Perform** the analysis (basic calculations, trend observations, break-even estimates).  
- **Interpret** the results in light of Meta’s strategy.

# Acquisition & ROI analysis {.scrollable}

:::medium
Did Meta’s big acquisitions pay off?
:::

:::fragment
Choose either **Instagram** (acquired 2012, ~$1B) or **WhatsApp** (acquired 2014, ~$19B).  
Perform two analyses:

1. [Strategic future value]{.highlight} (simple method):\
   Estimate *annual revenue* in a chosen “mature” year = monetizable MAUs^[MAU = Monthly Active Users] × ARPU^[ARPU = Average Revenue per User ].\
   Compare this to the acquisition price to get a ballpark ROI.\
2. [NPV calculation]{.highlight} (finance method):\
   Forecast annual cash flows over a given time horizon (e.g., 10 years from the acquisition).\
   Assume a growth rate (g) and a discount rate (r).\
   Calculate NPV of cash flows and compare with acquisition price.\

Conclude whether the ROI appears positive, negative, or unclear — and why.

[**Solution notes**]{.h4}

- **Instagram**: Bought for ~$1B in 2012 when it had ~30M users. In 2025, >2B monthly active users (MAUs). Even at modest monetization rates (~$5–10/user/year), annual revenue potential >$10–20B, far exceeding purchase price. ROI extremely high.  

- **WhatsApp**: Bought for ~$19B in 2014, now ~2.7B MAUs. Monetization direct revenue still limited, but indirect value is huge (user lock-in, integration into Meta ecosystem, status as dominant messaging platform). ROI positive but less straightforward to measure in pure $ terms.  


[**Instagram example**]{.h4}

**Step 1 – Strategic Future Value**  

- Acquisition price (2012): $1B  
- MAUs in 2025: ~2.0B
- ARPU (estimate, global average): $5/year  
- Annual revenue potential in 2025: 2.0B × $5 = $10B/year

**Step 2 – NPV Calculation**  

Assumptions:

- Starting CF (2012): 30M users, monetization rate of $5/user/year (conservative monetization start).  
- Growth rate g = 10% until 2025 (actually it was > 50%)
- WACC r = 8%.  
- Time horizon: 2015–2025 (10 years).

Formula:  

$NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{CF_0 \times (1+g)^t}{(1 + r)^t}$

| Year | Cash Flow (CF) | Discount Factor | Present Value  |
|------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1    | $165.0M        | 0.926           | $152.8M        |
| 2    | $181.5M        | 0.857           | $155.6M        |
| 3    | $199.7M        | 0.794           | $158.5M        |
| 4    | $219.6M        | 0.735           | $161.4M        |
| 5    | $241.6M        | 0.681           | $164.4M        |
| 6    | $265.8M        | 0.630           | $167.5M        |
| 7    | $292.3M        | 0.583           | $170.5M        |
| 8    | $321.6M        | 0.540           | $173.7M        |
| 9    | $353.7M        | 0.500           | $176.9M        |
| 10   | $389.1M        | 0.463           | $180.2M        |
| **Total** |           |                 | ** $1,661.5M** |

**NPV ≈ $1.66 billion** 

Investment & Return Summary:

$ROI = \frac{NPV - Investment}{Investment} \times 100$

| Metric             | Value      |
|--------------------|------------|
| Initial Investment | $1,000M    |
| NPV of Cash Flows  | $1,661.5M  |
| Net Gain           | $661.5M    |
| **ROI**            | **66.15%** |

Even with conservative assumptions, the acquisition was an outstanding investment.

# AI & AGI investments

:::medium
Do Meta’s AI bets show measurable momentum?
:::

- Identify at least 3 KPIs that could indicate progress from AI/AGI investments.  
- Use the sources to observe trends over the last 2–3 years.  
- Discuss whether the trends suggest these investments are paying off now, or positioning Meta for future advantage.

KPIs from sources:  

- **CapEx**: $8.9B in Q2 2025 (up from ~$7B in Q2 2024).  
- **AI Infrastructure focus**: significant shift in spending toward GPU clusters and LLM training.  
- **Product KPI**: Increase in time spent on Reels, AI-driven recommendations contributing to higher engagement.  

Trend: Rising CapEx + higher AI integration → short-term margin pressure, but sets up infrastructure for long-term ad revenue optimisation and AI-powered products.  

**KPI table**  

| KPI              | 2023     | 2024     | 2025     | Trend           | Interpretation            |
|------------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| CapEx (Q2, \$B)  | 6.5      | 7.0      | 8.9      | ↑ steady growth | Heavy AI infra investment |
| R&D spend ($B)   | 10.4     | 12.6     | 14.1     | ↑ strong growth | AI as major driver        |
| Reels watch time | +15% YoY | +30% YoY | +40% YoY | ↑ acceleration  | AI recs boost engagement  |

# Break {.headline-only}

# Reality Labs & break-even analysis 

:::medium
When might Reality Labs stop losing billions?
:::

- Identify Reality Labs revenue and operating losses from latest reports.  
- Estimate the scale or efficiency gains needed to reach break-even (e.g., “sales must double”).  
- Consider whether such a break-even is realistic in the medium term.

- Q2 2025 revenue: ~$0.5B  
- Q2 2025 operating loss: ~$4.53B  
- Break-even calculation (holding revenue constant):  
  - Needs ~900% revenue growth (0.5B → ~5.0B) **or**  
  - Needs ~90% cost reduction if revenue stays flat.  
- Feasibility: Highly unlikely in short-term; likely a long-term “moonshot” bet.  

**Sample break-even table**  

| Revenue (Q2) | Operating loss (Q2) | Sales ↑ needed (%) | Cost ↓ needed (%) | Feasibility |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| $0.5B        | $4.53B               | +900%             | –90%              | Low         |

# CPM reflection

:::medium
Pulling it all together.
:::

- As a group, create a **single Balanced Scorecard** that is capable to reflect the performance of all three strategic moves.  
- For each perspective (Financial, Customer, Internal Process, Learning & Growth), note 1–2 KPIs you would track going forward.  
- Look at Meta's current earnings and assess its performance based on your Balanced Scorecard.

| Perspective      | KPI(s)                                                         | Current status (Q2 2025)                                    | Comment / Insight                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Financial        | ROI on Instagram & WhatsApp, Operating Margin, RL Loss Ratio  | Core ad margins strong; RL losses still >\$4B/quarter       | Acquisitions massively profitable; RL is a long-term drain on financials         |
| Customer         | MAUs & DAUs growth, Engagement Time per user, User retention  | MAUs ~3.1B; engagement up from AI-driven recommendations    | Customer base growing steadily; engagement boost from AI integration              |
| Internal Process | AI model deployment cycle time, Ad relevance score             | Faster AI releases; improved ad targeting metrics           | AI infrastructure investment showing operational returns                         |
| Learning & Growth| AI R&D spend, XR talent acquisition, Patent filings            | R&D ~\$14B/year; XR hires steady; AI patent portfolio grows | Strong innovation pipeline, especially in AI; RL talent base stable but costly    |

**Assessment from Q2 2025 earnings (high level)**:

- **Strengths:** Financial returns from acquisitions, user growth, engagement boost from AI.
- **Weaknesses:** Reality Labs continues heavy losses with uncertain timeline to profitability.
- **Strategic alignment:** AI investment benefits are already visible in customer and internal process metrics; RL remains a long-term bet with weak short-term BSC performance.

**Key takeaways**:

- A good BSC for a diversified tech company must balance high-return mature businesses with speculative long-term bets.
- Financial perspective is not the only decision driver — strong performance in Customer and Learning & Growth can justify current financial underperformance in moonshot areas.
