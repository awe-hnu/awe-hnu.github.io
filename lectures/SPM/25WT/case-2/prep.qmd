# Introduction

You will analyze three strategic moves Meta has made using different Corporate Performance Management (CPM) tools. 

This **preparation guide** helps you to prepare by locating the data you need—but you must determine which specific figures to extract and how to use them.

# Acquisitions & ROI analysis

Find information about one major acquisition (Instagram or WhatsApp), why it was made as well how it has performed:

- Data showing how the platform performs today
- Metrics that would help you estimate value creation
- Growth patterns that help you to make predictions about growth after the acquisition
- Information needed to discount future cash flows

Further, think about:

- How would you estimate value if specific revenue isn't disclosed separately?
- What assumptions do you need to make for a multi-year projection?
- How do you account for indirect strategic benefits?
- What makes an acquisition "successful" from a performance management perspective?

# AI/AGI investment

Research data about major AI infrastructure and AGI research investments:

- Evidence of how much Meta is spending on AI/AGI
- Trends showing whether investment is increasing, stable, or decreasing (over the last 3 years)
- Metrics that might show whether AI investments are generating returns
- Both financial and non-financial performance data
- Evidence of operational improvements or strategic advantages

Further, think about:

- Which metrics best indicate whether AI investments are "working"?
- How do you distinguish between short-term costs and long-term strategic positioning?
- What evidence would convince you these investments are paying off?
- How long should you wait before judging ROI on this type of investment?

# Reality Labs

Research about the VR/AR hardware and metaverse platform development at meta:

- Financial results for the *Reality Labs* business segment
- Trends over recent quarters/years
- Information that helps you understand the gap between current state and profitability
- Factors that could close that gap (revenue growth, cost reduction, or both)
- Management commentary on expectations and timeline
- Market dynamics affecting this business

Further, think about:

- Is break-even the right way to evaluate a "moonshot" investment?
- What's more realistic to quickly achieve break-even: dramatic revenue increase or significant cost reduction?
- How do you balance long-term strategic value against short-term financial losses?

#  Balanced Scorecard

Research on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) performance management framework and gather relevant evidence for each BSC perspective (FY 2025) using the sources checked so far.

Further, think about:

- Which perspectives show strength and which show weakness?
- How should different perspectives be weighted given Meta's strategy?
- What does "good performance" mean for a company making multi-billion dollar long-term bets?
- How would you use this BSC to guide future resource allocation decisions?

# Final notes

Read critically:

- Management emphasizes positives—look for what's not said
- Compare trends over time, not just absolute numbers
- Note which metrics management chooses to highlight

Document your approach:

- Track which sources you used for which data points
- Be ready to explain your assumptions and estimations
- Note what's disclosed vs. what you had to estimate

It is not about perfection:

This is **real-world analysis with real-world constraints**. You won't find perfect data for everything. Part of the learning is determining:

- What's good enough to make a reasonable analysis
- What assumptions are justified
- How to communicate uncertainty in your findings
- How to make informed judgments despite incomplete information

**The goal of the case study is not finding "the right answer"—it's demonstrating sound analytical thinking and appropriate use of CPM tools.**
