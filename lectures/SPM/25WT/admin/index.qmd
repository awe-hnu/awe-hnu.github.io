# Motivation {background-color="#0333ff"}

:::large
> There is more vacuity about strategy than about any other topic in business today. *John Kay, Financial Times in @mintzberg2005strategy*
:::

:::notes
While this observation about strategic vacuity remains painfully relevant, it reflects a deeper challenge: in contemporary firms, strategy can no longer be untangled from digital technologies, particularly AI. Modern strategizing processes—from competitive analysis and resource allocation to performance monitoring and strategic adaptation—are increasingly embedded within and enabled by digital systems. 

Understanding business strategy frameworks, strategic planning processes, and performance measurement approaches is therefore essential for developing digital solutions that truly create value rather than simply automating existing inefficiencies. Without grounding in how organizations formulate strategies, assess performance through balanced scorecards and variance analysis, and manage through control systems, IT and AI professionals risk building sophisticated technologies that miss strategic context entirely. 

Conversely, strategic thinking divorced from digital capabilities remains the kind of empty rhetoric Kay criticizes. In an era where strategy and technology are fundamentally intertwined, mastering both strategic frameworks and performance management principles becomes prerequisite for creating digital solutions that drive genuine competitive advantage.

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance — see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum.
:::

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` — very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` — good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a “good performance”.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an “average   performance”*                                                                                             |
| `3` — satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` — sufficient             | [A   performance that “still adequately satisfies” the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` — not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}
