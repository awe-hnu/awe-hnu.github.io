# Literature

Your first task: __get to know the literature__ (what is already known)

. . .

Focus on __scientific literature__ (peer-reviewed, high quality)

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- Only scientific papers that are peer-reviewed
- Concering the theoretical part: no practitioner papers (e.g., white papers from consulting firms), no books, not web-sources, etc. [^1]
- Recommendation is to restrict the search on high-quality IS journals, either
	- [Senior Scholars' Basket of Journals](https://aisnet.org/page/SeniorScholarBasket)
	- [A-ranked Journals in the VHB-JOURQUAL3 ranking](https://vhbonline.org/fileadmin/user_upload/JQ3_WI.pdf)
:::

[^1]: Practitioner papers and web-sources are only valid for empirical papers using secondary sources (e.g., desk research)

. . .

Use the __journal's archives__ to search for literature

. . .

Use __EndNote__ to organize your literature

# Next steps

:::{.incremental}
- Decide on your __topic__
- Work through the __literature review materials__ on Moodle
- __Read the recommended papers__; extract definitions for the main concepts
- Start your (structured) __literature search__ (e.g., with two to three journals)
- Get the full-texts of the identified articles
- __Organize the literature__ in EndNote
- Start __reading articles__, begin with the two that are cited mostly
- Write down what you have learned for your study (e.g., definitions, concepts, mechanisms)
- Write down your __questions__ for our next session
- Book an appointment
