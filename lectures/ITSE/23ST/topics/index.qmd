# Overview

**General remark:** When you work on the topics, your ambition should be to produce a solid scientific paper (good way to prepare for the BA)

. . .

Topics:

:::{.incremental}
- Analysis of the smart city app Ulm/Neu-Ulm *(theory-based evaluation, 3 students)*
- Use of secondary material and IS *(structured literature review, 1 student)*
- Resource efficiency and IS *(structured literature review, 1 student)*
- Digitalization and sustainability in the DAX 40 companies  *(empiciral study, 2 students)*
:::

## Analysis of Smart City App 

Your task is to test and evaluate a prototype of a smart city app for Ulm/Neu-Ulm. The aim of the app is, among others, to promote sustainable mobility forms like public transportation or biking. As the prototype is in German, respective language skills are required. 
As to that you will adopt a design-science approach and:

-	Review the literature and summarize the knowledge on mobility apps and platforms that are used to induce behavioral change. 
-	Analyze the prototype app in regards to its design principles based on prior literature.
-	Test the app and its effects, e.g. among students.
-	Deduct learnings and update the design principles based on the evaluation.

The focus of this work should be on the test and evaluation phase.
You will report and discuss your findings in a joint paper.

## Use of secondary material and IS

Your task is to review current literature to answer following research question: "How can IS help increase the use of secondary materials in
new product offerings?"

As to that, you will conduct a structured literature review [following @webster2002analyzing][^initialSearchQueryA] and analyze the included papers and synthesize the existing knowledge.

You will report and discuss your findings in a paper.

## Resource efficiency and IS

Your task is to review current literature to answer following research question: "How can the use of (innovative) IT improve resource efficiency?"

As to that, you will conduct a structured literature review following [@webster2002analyzing][^initialSearchQueryB] and analyze the included papers and synthesize the existing knowledge.

You will report and discuss your findings in a paper.

## Digitalization and sustainability in DAX 40 companies

Your task is to review the current practice of leading German companies to combine digitalization and sustainability to answer following research question: "How do leading companies use digitalization initiatives to improve sustainability?"

As to that, you will analyze the annual (sustainability) reports of the leading 40 DAX companies within the last three years, press releases and newspaper articles and identitify if the companies relate their digilization inniatives to sustainabilty efforts and how they use digitalization to improve social, economical, and environmental sustainability.

You will report and discuss your findings in **a joint paper**.
