# Task

During the semester you will be required to **analyse an example on how IS impacts sustainable development**.

. . .

To avoid duplicates and ensure alignment with my expectations, you should discuss the topic in advance with me. 

. . .

You need to do research on

::: incremental
- the characteristics of the information system,
- the dimension of sustainable development it is related to,
- the process and outcomes,
- complexities and trade offs,
- as well as relevant concepts and theories to frame your findings. 
:::

. . .

You can include grey literature^[Grey literature includes usually not peer-reviewed material such as white papers, books, web-sources, etc.], but you need to consider at least five (5) scientific papers.


## Deliverables

:::medium
[You need to hold **a presentation** of 10 minutes]{.fragment .fade-in} [and to **discuss your insights** in a Q&A.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

::: incremental
- Upload your presentation slides (.pdf) and a declaration on the use of GenAI (.pdf, use this [template](assets/ISSD_Declaration-GenAI-Usage.docx)) via Moodle until the deadline
- Use following naming scheme: 
  - `ISSD_WT24_Surname-Name_presentation.pdf` 
  - `ISSD_WT24_Surname-Name_declaration.pdf`
- You will present the slides uploaded to Moodle (no late updates)
- For the deadline and the presentation dates, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

:::html-hidden
:::medium
[The **presentation** of your findings [(9-10 min., 70%)]{.light-grey}]{.fragment .fade-in}     
[+ the **discussion** [(~ 4 min., 20%)]{.light-grey}]{.fragment .fade-in}     
[+ your **contributions** to other presentations [(10%)]{.light-grey}.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::
:::


:::notes
The grade will be a combination of

- your **presentation** of your findings     
  *(9-10 minutes, 70% of your grade),*
- the **discussion** after the presentation      
  *(approx. 4 minutes, 20% of your grade),*
- and your **contributions to the discussion of your fellow students' presentations**   
  *(10% of your grade).*
:::

## Evaluation criteria {.srollable}

An **very good presentation** has the following characteristics.

:::incremental
- Clearly defines the approach to use IS for sustainable development
- Accurately describes the characteristics of the IS, the dimension of sustainable development, the process and outcomes as well as complexities and trade offs
- Relates the findings to relevant concepts and theories
- Demonstrates critical thinking in considering the role of IS for sustainable development
- Is well-organized and easy to follow
- Presents information clearly and concisely
- Speaks confidently and professionally
- Integrates research from at least five (5) scientific papers
- Accurately cites and references all sources
- Demonstrates a clear and depth understanding of the contents
:::

-----

10% of your grade depends on how you engage in the discussion of other presentations.

:::incremental
- Points are given for each **thoughtful question or comment**^[The question needs to go beyond basic clarification and need to how deeper understanding; the question or comment encourages further discussion or analysis] you make during the Q&A of other presentations
- Additional points are given for the best question per presentation

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum. 
:::

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` ‚Äî very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` ‚Äî good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a ‚Äúgood performance‚Äù.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an ‚Äúaverage   performance‚Äù*                                                                                             |
| `3` ‚Äî satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` ‚Äî sufficient             | [A   performance that ‚Äústill adequately satisfies‚Äù the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` ‚Äî not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}                                                                                                                                  |
# Scientific literature

In your presentation, you need to consider at least **five scientific papers**.

::: incremental
- Select only papers that are peer-reviewed.
- Recommendation is to focus the search on high-quality IS journals^[For a more balanced discussion of quality indicators of papers see e.g., @fitzgerald2019information], such as
  - [Senior Scholars‚Äô Basket of Journals](https://aisnet.org/page/SeniorScholarListofPremierJournals)
  - A-ranked or B-ranked journals in the [VHB-JOURQUAL3 ranking](https://vhbonline.org/fileadmin/user_upload/JQ3_WI.pdf)
- Use [Web of Science](https://www-webofscience-com.ezproxy.hnu.de/wos/woscc/basic-search), [Google Scholar](http://ezproxy.hnu.de/login?url=https://scholar.google.de) or the journals‚Äô archives to search for literature
- Use the citation count as primary quality indicator (rule of thumb: the more cited, the more significant is the paper).
- Look for literature reviews that summarize the current state of knowledge.
