## Discussion {.html-hidden .unlisted .discussion-slide background-color=black}

:::large
What to you **expect** from this course?
:::

# General remarks

:::medium
In this course you will [**dive into key emerging technologies**,]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[get to know **their key characteristics**]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[and **fields of application** ]{.fragment .fade-in}
[as well as important **ethical considerations related to their implementation and use.**]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::notes

As to that, you will

- get to know my theoretically-grounded hypotheses on future technology and media,
- apply these learnings and and expertise gained in previous semesters to analyze emergent technologies,
- identify fields for application and as well as (ethical) implications,
- and present and discuss your findings in a presentation (solo).

:::

# Learning objectives

During this course, you should advance your skills in the following areas:

:::incremental
- understanding of the **key characteristics of emerging technologies** in general, the process and phases of technology emergence, as well as specific characteristics of emerging information technologies/digital technologies,
- knowledge of **fields of application** of current merging digital technologies, their impact on (information) systems used by individuals, organizations, and society, as well as media
- understanding of **potentials and risks** for individuals, economies and societies,
- communication of conclusions and the underlying knowledge, 
- and social and ethical responsibilities in uncertain and ambiguous contexts.

# Effort

::: {.html-hidden .large}
[2 ECTS]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[≈ 60 h workload]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[≈ 24 h classes]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[+ 36 h self learning]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

:::notes
You will gain 2 ECTS for this course. This equals approx. __60 hours workload__, of which you need most to pass the course.

- Lectures (approx. 24 hours)
- Preparation (approx. 8 hours)
- Presentation (remaining time)
:::

:::fragment
It is very important that you reserve enough time to attend the classes AND prepare your presentation (see @tbl-schedule for details).
:::

# Examination

:::medium
You will be graded on
[your **understanding of emergent digital technologies**,]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[their characteristics and implications, ]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[and your **ability to critically discuss** these topics.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::incremental
The examination will be oral (20 minutes).
:::

# Schedule {.smaller .scrollable}

::: notes
It is of importance that you prepare yourself for the sessions and work on the presentation continually. Please prepare your schedule accordingly.

## Grading

The assessment criterion are:

- **Understanding** of key characteristics, emergence processes, and technology-specific features
- **Fields of application** and impact on individuals, organizations, society, and media
- **Critical evaluation** of opportunities and threats and ethical implications; 
- **Argumentation**, particularly clarity, structure, and evidence-based reasoning
- **Reflection**, particularly regarding synthesis of course content, application of prior knowledge, social/ethical responsibility

Given the questions asked during the oral exam, an excellent performance ...

- demonstrates comprehensive understanding of emergence phases and technology characteristics; independently identifies patterns across different technologies; provides nuanced explanations of what makes technologies "emerging"
- identifies diverse, relevant application fields; analyzes multi-level impacts (individual/organizational/societal) with concrete examples; demonstrates systems thinking in impact assessment
- shows balanced, nuanced analysis of potentials and risks; articulates complex ethical dilemmas; demonstrates awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity; considers multiple stakeholder perspectives
- gives clear, well-structured responses; arguments grounded in theory and evidence; uses appropriate technical terminology; adapts communication to questions
- seamlessly integrates theoretical frameworks from course with prior knowledge; demonstrates reflexive understanding of social and ethical responsibilities; shows independent critical thinking
