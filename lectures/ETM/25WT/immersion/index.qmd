## The steam enginge

:::{.medium .link-color}
During the late 18th century and the early 19th century, the steam engine was considered an emerging technology.
:::

**Why?**

:::notes
- **Radical novelty:** Steam enginges represented a significant departure from previous methods of power generation (e.g., such as human or animal labor).
- **Relatively fast growth:** Once the potential of steam power was realized, the adoption and diffusion of steam engines spread rapidly across various industries and regions.
- **Coherence:** The development of the steam engine was part of a coherent technological trajectory.
- **Prominent impact:** The steam engine had a profound impact on society, economy, and culture (i.e., the Industrial Revolution)
- **Uncertainty and ambiguity:**  In its early stages of development, the steam engine faced uncertainty and ambiguity regarding its reliability, efficiency, and practical applications.

:::notes
Improved accuracy and robustness
: Multimodal systems can enhance accuracy and robustness by integrating multiple modalities, such as speech, gesture, and touch, which can compensate for limitations in individual modalities. Example: medical diagnosis assistant (verbal description, medical imaging, history, sensor data)

Enhanced bandwidth
: By utilizing multiple modalities simultaneously, multimodal systems can provide users with a higher bandwidth of interaction, allowing for more efficient communication and interaction. Example: autonomous vehicle navigation (LIDAR, Radar, GPS, Camera Vision)

Flexibility and user preference
: Multimodal systems offer users the flexibility to choose the most convenient modality for interaction based on their preferences, abilities, and the context of the task. Example: smart home assistant (voice, touch, gesture, mobile app)

Naturalness and ease of use
: Integrating multiple modalities can make interaction with technology more natural and intuitive, mimicking the way humans naturally communicate and interact with each other. Example: language learning application

Redundancy and error correction
: Multiple modalities provide redundancy in input, allowing for error detection and correction. For example, if one modality fails or is misunderstood, other modalities can provide additional context or clarification. Example: speach recognition system (audio, lip reading, facial expression)

Accessibility
: Multimodal systems can improve accessibility for users with diverse abilities and preferences by offering multiple modes of interaction that cater to different needs and capabilities.

Support for complex tasks
: Combining multiple modalities can support complex tasks that require different types of input or involve multiple steps, allowing users to interact with technology in a more efficient and effective manner. Example: surgical robotic system (hand movement, 3D medical imaging, patien vital signs, AR)

:::

:::notes

The virtuality continuum (also called the reality-virtuality continuum) is a concept that places all possible variations of real and virtual environments on a single continuous scale. Here's how it's organized:

- At one end of the continuum is the **Real Environment** - our actual physical world that we perceive directly through our senses without any technological mediation.
- At the opposite end is the **Virtual Environment** (or Virtual Reality) - a completely synthetic digital environment that replaces the real world with computer-generated content.
- Between these two extremes lies **Mixed Reality**, which includes:
  - **Augmented Reality** (AR) - closer to the real environment, where virtual objects are overlaid onto the real world. The primary world remains the physical environment, but it's enhanced with digital elements (like Pokémon GO or AR navigation apps).
  - **Augmented Virtuality** (AV) - closer to the virtual environment, where elements from the real world are brought into a predominantly virtual space.

The key insight from Milgram and Kishino's taxonomy is that rather than seeing these as discrete categories, they represent points along a spectrum where the proportion of real to virtual content gradually shifts. This continuum helps us understand and classify different mixed reality technologies based on how much they blend or replace our physical reality.

Extent of world knowledge (comprehensiveness of the world model)
: This refers to how much the system "knows" about the environment it's representing. On the reality end of the continuum, there's no need for the system to have knowledge about the world since it's the actual physical world. As you move toward virtuality, the system requires increasingly comprehensive models of what it's displaying. A fully virtual environment needs complete knowledge about every object, surface, and behavior in the simulated world.

Reproductionfidelity
: This describes the quality and realism of the displayed imagery. At the reality end, reproduction fidelity is perfect because you're seeing the actual world. As you move toward virtual environments, the challenge becomes creating images that approach the visual quality of direct viewing. Early VR had low fidelity (primitive graphics), while modern systems strive for photorealism. This factor addresses questions like: How realistic do the virtual elements look? How well do they blend with real objects?

Extent of presence metaphor (immersiveness)
: This relates to the degree to which the user feels present within the displayed scene. It includes factors like:

- Field of view (how much of your visual field is covered)
- Stereo viewing capabilities (3D depth perception)
- Head tracking and other sensory feedback
- The extent to which the user feels immersed rather than just observing

:::

## Stimuly

:::notes

**Visual Stimuli**

- The extent to which virtual objects obscure real objects and vice versa
- Whether the display is monoscopic or stereoscopic (providing depth perception)
- The realism and fidelity of the rendered images
- Field of view considerations
- Registration accuracy (how well virtual content aligns with the real world)

**Auditory Stimuli**

- Real environments have natural, unmediated sound
- Augmented reality might overlay virtual sounds onto real-world audio
- Virtual environments must synthesize all auditory information

**Tactile Stimuli**

- Real environments provide natural tactile feedback
- Mixed reality might offer limited haptic feedback for virtual objects
- Advanced virtual environments aim to simulate tactile sensations

**Olfactory Stimuli**

Smell is one of the more challenging senses to reproduce in mixed and virtual reality contexts, though it would follow the same conceptual continuum.

**Interactive Stimuli**

How users engage with and manipulate the environment:

- In real environments, interaction is direct and natural
- In augmented reality, users might interact with virtual objects using real-world movements
- In fully virtual environments, all interactions must be captured and translated into the virtual space

:::

Important stimuli that determine the immersiveness of environments created by  technology are

[olfactory stimuly, and]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[interactive stimuly.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
:::

. . .

In order to create these, technology needs **visual display** with high representational fidelity and media, **auditory and haptic interfaces** and the capability to **track movements**.

:::

:::{.fragment fragment-index=2}
[AR technology]{.link-color} superimposes virtual objects onto a live view of physical environments, helping users visualize how these objects fit into their physical world.

## Hardware components

AR technologies require following hardware components:

:::incremental
1. Devices for displaying the virtual objects
2. Input devices to detect users’ interaction with the real and virtual object
3. Sensors to capture users’ positions and movements
4. Computing devices that combine the input data and create the virtual overlays
