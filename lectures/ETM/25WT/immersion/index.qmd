# Recap {.headline-only}

## The steam enginge

:::{.medium .link-color}
During the late 18th century and the early 19th century, the steam engine was considered an emerging technology.
:::

**Why?**

:::notes
- **Radical novelty:** Steam enginges represented a significant departure from previous methods of power generation (e.g., such as human or animal labor).
- **Relatively fast growth:** Once the potential of steam power was realized, the adoption and diffusion of steam engines spread rapidly across various industries and regions.
- **Coherence:** The development of the steam engine was part of a coherent technological trajectory.
- **Prominent impact:** The steam engine had a profound impact on society, economy, and culture (i.e., the Industrial Revolution)
- **Uncertainty and ambiguity:**  In its early stages of development, the steam engine faced uncertainty and ambiguity regarding its reliability, efficiency, and practical applications.

:::notes
Improved accuracy and robustness
: Multimodal systems can enhance accuracy and robustness by integrating multiple modalities, such as speech, gesture, and touch, which can compensate for limitations in individual modalities. Example: medical diagnosis assistant (verbal description, medical imaging, history, sensor data)

Enhanced bandwidth
: By utilizing multiple modalities simultaneously, multimodal systems can provide users with a higher bandwidth of interaction, allowing for more efficient communication and interaction. Example: autonomous vehicle navigation (LIDAR, Radar, GPS, Camera Vision)

Flexibility and user preference
: Multimodal systems offer users the flexibility to choose the most convenient modality for interaction based on their preferences, abilities, and the context of the task. Example: smart home assistant (voice, touch, gesture, mobile app)

Naturalness and ease of use
: Integrating multiple modalities can make interaction with technology more natural and intuitive, mimicking the way humans naturally communicate and interact with each other. Example: language learning application

Redundancy and error correction
: Multiple modalities provide redundancy in input, allowing for error detection and correction. For example, if one modality fails or is misunderstood, other modalities can provide additional context or clarification. Example: speach recognition system (audio, lip reading, facial expression)

Accessibility
: Multimodal systems can improve accessibility for users with diverse abilities and preferences by offering multiple modes of interaction that cater to different needs and capabilities.

Support for complex tasks
: Combining multiple modalities can support complex tasks that require different types of input or involve multiple steps, allowing users to interact with technology in a more efficient and effective manner. Example: surgical robotic system (hand movement, 3D medical imaging, patien vital signs, AR)

![&nbsp;](images/virtuality-continuum.svg){.fragment height="420"}

:::

:::notes

The virtuality continuum (also called the reality-virtuality continuum) is a concept that places all possible variations of real and virtual environments on a single continuous scale. Here's how it's organized:

- At one end of the continuum is the **Real Environment** - our actual physical world that we perceive directly through our senses without any technological mediation.
- At the opposite end is the **Virtual Environment** (or Virtual Reality) - a completely synthetic digital environment that replaces the real world with computer-generated content.
- Between these two extremes lies **Mixed Reality**, which includes:
  - **Augmented Reality** (AR) - closer to the real environment, where virtual objects are overlaid onto the real world. The primary world remains the physical environment, but it's enhanced with digital elements (like Pokémon GO or AR navigation apps).
  - **Augmented Virtuality** (AV) - closer to the virtual environment, where elements from the real world are brought into a predominantly virtual space.

The key insight from Milgram and Kishino's taxonomy is that rather than seeing these as discrete categories, they represent points along a spectrum where the proportion of real to virtual content gradually shifts. This continuum helps us understand and classify different mixed reality technologies based on how much they blend or replace our physical reality.

Extent of world knowledge (comprehensiveness of the world model)
: This refers to how much the system "knows" about the environment it's representing. On the reality end of the continuum, there's no need for the system to have knowledge about the world since it's the actual physical world. As you move toward virtuality, the system requires increasingly comprehensive models of what it's displaying. A fully virtual environment needs complete knowledge about every object, surface, and behavior in the simulated world.

Reproduction fidelity
: This describes the quality and realism of the displayed imagery. At the reality end, reproduction fidelity is perfect because you're seeing the actual world. As you move toward virtual environments, the challenge becomes creating images that approach the visual quality of direct viewing. Early VR had low fidelity (primitive graphics), while modern systems strive for photorealism. This factor addresses questions like: How realistic do the virtual elements look? How well do they blend with real objects?

Extent of presence metaphor (immersiveness)
: This relates to the degree to which the user feels present within the displayed scene. It includes factors like:

- Field of view (how much of your visual field is covered)
- Stereo viewing capabilities (3D depth perception)
- Head tracking and other sensory feedback
- The extent to which the user feels immersed rather than just observing

:::

## Stimuli

:::notes

**Visual Stimuli**

- The extent to which virtual objects obscure real objects and vice versa
- Whether the display is monoscopic or stereoscopic (providing depth perception)
- The realism and fidelity of the rendered images
- Field of view considerations
- Registration accuracy (how well virtual content aligns with the real world)

**Auditory Stimuli**

- Real environments have natural, unmediated sound
- Augmented reality might overlay virtual sounds onto real-world audio
- Virtual environments must synthesize all auditory information

**Tactile Stimuli**

- Real environments provide natural tactile feedback
- Mixed reality might offer limited haptic feedback for virtual objects
- Advanced virtual environments aim to simulate tactile sensations

**Olfactory Stimuli**

Smell is one of the more challenging senses to reproduce in mixed and virtual reality contexts, though it would follow the same conceptual continuum.

**Interactive Stimuli**

How users engage with and manipulate the environment:

- In real environments, interaction is direct and natural
- In augmented reality, users might interact with virtual objects using real-world movements
- In fully virtual environments, all interactions must be captured and translated into the virtual space

:::

Important stimuli that determine the immersiveness of environments created by  technology are

:::medium
[Visual stimuli, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

[olfactory stimuli, and]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[interactive stimuli.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
:::

. . .

In order to create these, technology needs **visual displays** with high representational fidelity, **auditory and 
haptic interfaces**, **olfactory delivery systems** (e.g., scent devices), and the capability to **track movements** 
and enable **real-time interaction**.

## Discussion {.discussion-slide}

Immersion refers to the state of being deeply engaged, absorbed, or submerged in an environment, either physically or mentally.

:::medium
How is immersion reflected in augmented reality?
:::

:::notes
Immersion in augmented reality (AR) manifests quite differently than in fully virtual environments, creating what's often called a "blended" or "mixed" immersion experience. Here's how this plays out:

**Sensory integration**

AR achieves immersion by seamlessly layering digital content onto the real world. When done well, virtual objects appear anchored to physical spaces—shadows fall correctly, digital items occlude behind real objects, and elements respond to real-world lighting. This sensory coherence makes your brain accept the digital additions as part of your environment rather than separate overlays.

**Presence through context**

Unlike VR's total replacement of reality, AR creates immersion through contextual relevance. Digital information appears exactly where and when you need it—navigation arrows on actual streets, furniture visualized in your real room, or maintenance instructions overlaid on the specific machine you're repairing. This contextual anchoring keeps you engaged because the digital content directly enhances what you're already doing.

**Physical embodiment**
AR maintains your connection to the physical world, which paradoxically can deepen immersion for certain tasks. You use natural movements—walking around objects, reaching out to manipulate virtual items, looking around corners. Your real body remains the interface, making interactions feel more intuitive than controller-based systems.

**The immersion spectrum**

AR exists on a spectrum. Simple smartphone AR (like Pokémon GO) offers limited immersion—you're clearly looking at a screen. Advanced headsets with wide fields of view, spatial audio, and hand tracking create much deeper immersion by occupying more of your sensory bandwidth while still preserving real-world awareness.

The unique quality of AR immersion is that it's additive rather than replacing—you're deeply engaged with an enhanced version of reality rather than transported elsewhere entirely.
:::

## Hardware components

AR technologies require following hardware components:

:::incremental
1. Devices for multi-sensory output: visual displays, audio systems, haptic actuators, and (potentially) olfactory 
generators
2. Input devices to detect users' interactions with real and virtual objects
3. Sensors to capture users' positions and movements
4. Computing devices that combine input data and create the virtual overlays
:::

. . .

Advancements in mobile computing and telecommunications infrastructures (will) increase the mobility and, thus, usability of these devices significantly.
