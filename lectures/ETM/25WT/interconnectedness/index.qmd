## Emerging technologies

@rotolo2015emerging outlines five attributes that classify emerging technologies and differentiate them from other technologies:

:::medium
:::incremental
1. Radical novelty    
2. Relatively fast growth    
3. Coherence    
4. Prominent impact    
5. Uncertainty and ambiguity    
:::
:::

## Hypothesis 1 {background-color="#0333ff"}

:::large
Emerging information technologies enable **multimodal** and **immersive** systems.
:::

## Multimodality

. . .

:::medium
Multimodality refers to the use of [multiple modes of communication]{.link-color} to to create meaning.
:::

. . .

Multimodality implies that the use of several means of communication contributes to a better overall understanding of a message.

:::aside
@adami2016introducing
:::

## Immersion

. . .

:::medium
Immersion refers to the state of [being deeply engaged, absorbed, or submerged in an environment]{.link-color}, either physically or mentally.
:::

. . .

Immersion implies that the consciousness of the immersed person is detached from their physical self. Immersiveness is the quality or degree of being immersive.

:::aside
@suh2018state, @lee2013presence

:::

## Hypoptheses 2 {background-color="#0333ff"}

:::large
Emerging information technologies enable **intelligent** and **affective** systems.
:::

## Intelligence

. . .

:::medium
Intelligent systems work in [complex environments]{.link-color}, have [cognitive abilities]{.link-color}, and exhibit
[complex behavior]{.link-color}.
:::

. . .

The capacity to work in a complex environment is described as agency, cognitive abilities are, for instance, perception and language, and complex behavior is reflected, for instance, by rationality and learning.

:::aside
@RusselNorvig2022AIMA 
:::

## Affection

. . .

:::medium
Affective computer systems exhibit human-like capabilities of [observation]{.link-color}, [interpretation]{.link-color} and [generation of emotions]{.link-color}.
:::

. . .

Affective systems simulate empathy — they can interpret the emotional states of humans and adapt their behavior to them, giving an appropriate response for those emotions.

## Discussion {.discussion-slide background-color="#000"}

:::medium
Do you have support for the hypotheses outlined so far? 
:::

Take 7 minutes to reflect on the extent to which your assigned technology has the potential to create multimodal, immersive, intelligent and/or affective systems.


# Hypothesis 3 {background-color="#0333ff"}

:::large
Emerging information technologies enable strongly **interconnected** and **distributed** systems.
:::

# Interconnectedness {.headline-only}

## Definition

. . .

:::medium
Interconnectedness refers to a [formal linkage between two different systems]{.link-color}. 
:::

. . .

[Interdependence]{.link-color}, denotes a closer relationship in which two systems are not only connected, but depend on each other in some way, such as functionally.

Not all interconnected systems are interdependent, \
but all interdependent systems are interconnected.

:::aside
@zimmerman2001social
:::

## Computer networks

. . . 

:::medium
A computer network is a collection of computers and devices connected so that they can [share information and services]{.link-color}.
:::

. . .

Unlike phone lines or cable TV, which are designed for specific tasks, computer networks are flexible. They use general-purpose equipment that can handle many kinds of data. This [versatility]{.link-color} allows computer networks to support a vast and constantly evolving range of applications.

## Excursus: Information Systems

An information system (IS) ...

:::incremental
1. is defined by its perimeters/boundaries, certain inputs and outputs and its internal states
2. can be broken down into a set of smaller subsystems
3. can be considered in interaction with other systems (no IS is an island)
4. goes through various stages in its lifetime^[Lifecycle stages can be design, development, test, operation phases, for instance]

6. can be modeled at various levels of abstraction
7. can be viewed along several layers (e.g., purpose, function, composition)
8. can be described through different perspectives
:::

## The Internet

. . .

:::medium
The Internet can be defined as a [public wide area computer network]{.link-color} that uses the TCP/IP protocol suite to [interconnect computer systems across the world]{.link-color}.
:::

. . .


The Internet [provides a vast range of information resources and services]{.link-color} such as communication (e.g., electronic mail, telephony, and instant messaging), or file transfer (e.g., file sharing, FTP, video, and audio streaming), and the metaservice WWW.

:::aside
POP = Point of Presence, IXP = Internet Exchange Point, ISP = Internet Servicve Provider
:::

:::notes

1. The transmission is initiated by the end user , whose computer is connected with the Point of presence (POP) of his regional ISP. The POP is a local access point of an ISP where the telecommunication lines from commercial or domestic buildings are connected to the ISP’s network.
2. Destination is not in the regional ISPs network, therefore handover to a tier 1 ISP
3. Tier 1 ISP establishs a connection with the tier 1 network, the destination tier 2 ISP is part of
4. Tier 1 ISP establishs a connection with the destination tier 2 ISP
5. POP connects tier 2 ISP with the destination endpoint

**Tier-1 networks** are the backbone of the internet. They are the elite internet service providers (ISPs) that can reach every other network on the internet without relying on any other provider. Here's what makes them special:

- **Global reach:** Tier-1 networks have extensive infrastructure spanning multiple countries, often built and owned by them. This allows them to directly connect to a vast portion of the internet.
- **Peering agreements:** Unlike other ISPs that might pay to route traffic through larger networks, Tier-1s exchange traffic directly with each other through peering agreements. These agreements are typically free and reciprocal, meaning both parties benefit from the direct connection.
- **High capacity:** Tier-1 networks are built to handle massive amounts of internet traffic. They have robust infrastructure with high bandwidth capabilities to ensure smooth data flow.
- **Independent routing:** Because they don't rely on other providers for transit, Tier-1 networks have more control over how they route traffic. This can lead to faster and more reliable connections for users.

**Analogy:** Think of Tier-1 networks as the major highways of the internet. They are the primary routes that carry most of the internet traffic directly between the major destinations. Other ISPs, like regional or local providers, might connect to these highways or even have their own smaller roads, but for long-distance travel, the Tier-1 networks are the crucial infrastructure.

**Tier-2 networks** are the workhorses of the internet, providing internet access to a large portion of users. Unlike Tier-1 networks, they don't have the same level of global reach and independence, but they play a vital role in connecting users to the broader internet. Here's how they function:

- **Regional or national reach:** Tier-2 networks typically operate within a specific region or country. They have their own infrastructure but might not have the extensive global reach of Tier-1 providers.
- **Hybrid approach to traffic routing:** Tier-2 networks use a combination of methods to reach the wider internet:
  - **Peering:** They establish peering agreements with other networks, including Tier-1s and other Tier-2s, to directly exchange traffic for specific destinations. This helps reduce reliance on expensive transit fees.
  - **Transit:** In some cases, Tier-2 networks might purchase transit services from Tier-1 providers to reach parts of the internet that they don't have direct peering connections with.

**Analogy:** Imagine Tier-2 networks as the regional highways and major roads that connect to the main highways (Tier-1 networks). They play a crucial role in funneling traffic to the major routes and distributing it within a specific region.

## Internet protocol suite

. . .

:::medium
The Internet protocol suite is a set of protocols that [enable communication over the Internet]{.link-color} by specifying data transmission, addressing, and routing.
:::

. . .

The protocol suite encompasses protocols that are designed to work together to govern how data is transferred from one system to another. The most important protocols are [TCP]{.link-color} and [IP]{.link-color}.

:::aside
@Sunyaev2020IC
:::

. . .

## TCP/IP

:::medium
The protocols are based on the principles of [independency]{.link-color}^[Independency refers to the fact that there are no specific hardware and software requirements] and [robustness]{.link-color}^[Refers to the a built in failure recovery mechanism that provides reliable end to end communication].
:::

. . .

While IP handles actual delivery of the data, TCP keeps track of the data.

:::incremental
- IP is responsible for addressing host interfaces, encapsulating data into datagrams and
routing data from a source host to a destination host
- TCP guarantees that all bytes are received in the right order by using positive acknowledgements (ACK) with re-transmission^[The receiver responds with an positive acknowledgements (ACK) for ever data packet received, sender retransmits packets for missing ACKs after a given time]
::::

## TCP/IP stack

::: {.r-stack .html-hidden}

![The TCP/IP stack and its four abstraction layers](images/tcp-ip-1.svg){.fragment height="420"}

![&nbsp;](images/tcp-ip.svg){.fragment height="420"}

:::

:::notes

**The application layer**

- provides applications with standardized interfaces that allow to send data to other applications and receive data from them
- makes use of lower layers and treats them as black boxes

**The transport layer**

- provides end-to-end data transfer by delivering data from an application to a remote or a local host
- TCP is well suited where data integrity is important 
- UDP provides highly efficient but less reliable data transmission and has no error recovery mechanism. It is therefore used for applications that need a fast transport mechanism and can tolerate the loss of some data (e.g., video streams)

**The network layer** (or Internet layer)

- exchanges data in form of datagrams across network boundaries, provides a uniform networking interface and enables internetworking
- defines the addressing and routing structures for the TCP/IP protocol suite. (IP is a connectionless protocol that provides a routing function that forwards data to a specific destination in the network that is identified by its unique IP address)

**The data link layer** (network interface layer or physical layer)

- provides the interface to the actual network hardware
- is the lowest layer because TCP/IP is designed to be hardware independent. As a result TCP/IP
- may be implemented on top of any networking technology
- includes all protocols used to describe network topology and to move data between two different hosts (e.g., Ethernet)

## Discussion {.discussion-slide background-color="#000"}

:::medium
IPv6, packet switching, router,\
and Domain Name System (DNS)
:::

What is meant by the these concepts?\
Why are they important for the functioning of the Internet?\
How do they support the principles of independency and robustness?

Take 10 minutes to research the concepts and to prepare yourself to explain these.

:::notes

An **IP address** is a unique string of numbers separated by full stops that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

**IPv6** is composed of eight hexadecimal numbers, separated through colons (128 bit long binary string) --> 2^128 unique adresses

**Packet switching** describes a switching and transmission technology which splits complete messages into smaller packets. These packets can be transmitted along different lines of a network and they are re assembled into the original message by the receiving host.

A **router** is a device on a network that determines the best path for forwarding a data packet toward its destination. The router is connected to at least two networks and is located at the gateway where one network meets another.

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a hierarchically structured, distributed set of databases that map IP addresses to corresponding domain names.

:::

## Importance

The internet protocol suite based on TCP/IP is the foundation upon which the modern internet is built, and **its importance extends to a vast range of emergent digital technologies** such as IoT, Cloud computing, and mobile computing.

:::medium
[TCP/IP provides a [universal language]{.link-color},]{.fragment}
[is [open]{.link-color} and [standardized]{.link-color},]{.fragment}
[is highly [scalable]{.link-color},]{.fragment}
[and allows for great [flexibility]{.link-color}.]{.fragment}
:::

:::notes

TCP/IP acts as a universal language for communication between devices on a network. It defines a set of rules and protocols that ensure data is broken down into packets, addressed correctly, and delivered reliably across different network types. This universality allows various devices and technologies to seamlessly connect and exchange information.

TCP/IP is an open standard, meaning its specifications are publicly available and not controlled by any single entity. This openness fosters innovation and development as anyone can build technologies that interoperate with the TCP/IP framework. This has been crucial for the rapid growth and diversification of the digital landscape.

TCP/IP is designed to be scalable and flexible. It can handle a vast number of devices and networks, making it adaptable to the ever-growing demands of the digital world. This scalability is essential for supporting the massive growth of connected devices and data traffic associated with emergent technologies.

TCP/IP is a modular protocol suite, meaning it consists of independent protocols that work together. This modularity allows for flexibility and customization. New protocols can be added or existing ones modified to address specific needs of emerging technologies.

:::notes
**Advancements in networking infrastructure:** Emerging technologies like 5G networks and advancements in fiber optic cables are enabling faster and more reliable data transmission. This improved infrastructure allows for a greater volume of data exchange and supports the growing number of interconnected devices.

**Enhancements in connectivity capabilities:** Emerging technologies allow to connect and exchange data more efficiently and reliably, e.g., due to miniturization, improved battery live, improved network management, self-configuration capabilities, etc.

**Standardization and interoperability:** New protocols and standards are constantly emerging to ensure different technologies can work together. This fosters a more interconnected ecosystem where devices and platforms can communicate and share information more easily.

:::

## Discussion {.discussion-slide background-color="#000"}

:::medium
What **challenges** arise from increasingly interconnected systems?
:::

:::notes

**Security concerns:** With more interconnected systems, there's a greater risk of cyberattacks. Ensuring the security and privacy of data in these systems is crucial.

**Digital divide:** Not everyone has equal access to the technologies that enable interconnected systems. Bridging this digital divide is essential to ensure everyone can benefit from these advancements.

# Excursus:\ Net Neutrality {.headline-only}


## Motivation {.no-headline .vertical-center}

:::large
The net neutrality movement aims to keep the internet [free and open]{.link-color}.
:::

## Concept

The phrase net neutrality is used to signify the concept that the Internet is merely a carrier of online content that does not distinguish one website from another^[Neut neutrality implies that, all things being equal, small content providers can deliver content just as fast, to the same people, as large content providers such as YouTube.]. 

. . .

:::medium
A “maximally useful public information network aspires to treat all content, sites, and platforms equally” [[@wu2003network, p. 142].]{.smaller}
:::

. . .

That usually means that ISPs charge consumers [only once for Internet access]{.link-color}, [do not favor one content provider
over another]{.link-color}, and [do not charge content providers for sending information]{.link-color} over broadband lines to end users.

## Group work {background-color="#000"}

Form small groups (3-4 students per group) and take 20 minutes to work on following tasks:

- Do additional research on the net neutrality debate.
- Assign each student one of the following stakeholder groups: ISPs, content providers, consumers, government.
- Research your assigned stakeholder group, focusing on interests, arguments for net neutrality, and arguments against net neutrality. 
- Reconvene as a team, share your findings and discuss the commonalities and differences in arguments across stakeholder groups.
- Summarize the arguments for net neutrality and against net neutrality.
- Identify areas of compromise or solutions that address the concerns of various stakeholders.
- Prepare a brief presentation (max. 5 minutes).


# Distributivity {.headline-only}

## Distributed systems

. . .

:::medium
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single coherent system.
:::

. . .

The independent computers, also known as nodes, communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages as they do not share a common memory.

:::notes
Autonomy
: Each node operates independently and has its own local memory. Distributed systems can be composed of different types of hardware and software components. 

Transparency
: A distributed system that is able to present itself to users and applications as it were only a single computer system is said to be transparent.

Reliability
: Distributed systems are designed to be fault-tolerant. This means that even if one or more nodes fail, the system can continue to operate with minimal disruption. 

Scalability
: The system can grow by adding more nodes without significant changes to its architecture. This allows them to handle increasing demands and workloads effectively.

Efficiency
: While distributed systems introduce some overhead due to communication and coordination between nodes, they can also achieve efficiency by distributing tasks and leveraging parallel processing capabilities of multiple nodes.
:::

## Example: WWW

The World Wide Web is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) [@berners2004architecture].

. . .

:::medium
Resources are hosted on [servers distributed worldwide]{.link-color}, and information is routed efficiently through various networks and ISPs to reach the end user.
:::

## Distributed vs. decentralized systems

Both distributed and decentralized systems involve multiple nodes working together.\
However, the key difference lies in how control and decision-making are managed.

. . .

:::medium
Distributed systems can have a central coordinating authority, whereas decentralized systems [distribute control and decision-making]{.link-color} equally among all nodes.
:::

## Exercise {.discussion-slide background-color="#000"}

:::medium
What specific distributed and/or decentralised systems are you familiar with?
:::

Form small groups and take 10 minutes to discuss examples and work out key characteristics.

:::notes

Key characteristics of distributed systems

- Physical separation: Nodes are located on different machines or networks.
- Communication: Nodes communicate through message passing.
- Coordination: There may be a central authority that coordinates the actions of the nodes, but it is not a requirement.
- Resource sharing: Resources such as processing power and data are shared across nodes.
- Fault tolerance: The system can continue to operate even if some nodes fail.
- Scalability: The system can grow by adding more nodes without significant changes to its architecture

Key characteristics of decentralized systems

- No central authority: There is no single point of control; each node operates independently.
- Equal authority: Every node has equal authority and decision-making capability.
- Consensus-based decision making: Decisions are made by consensus among the nodes.
- Fault tolerance: The system is resilient to failures because there is no single point of failure.
- Scalability: The system can scale by adding more nodes, similar to distributed systems

Key differences

- Control and governance
- Decision-making
- Failure impact
- Application
- Complexity and maintenance

:::notes

Scalability and efficiency
: Distributed systems allow for horizontal scaling, which means adding more nodes to handle increased workloads without significant changes to the system architecture. This scalability is crucial for modern applications that need to handle large volumes of data and high user traffic efficiently.

Fault tolerance and reliability
: Distributed systems are designed to be fault-tolerant, meaning they can continue to operate even if some components fail. This reliability is essential for critical applications such as financial transactions, healthcare systems, and autonomous vehicles, where downtime or data loss can have severe consequences.

Real-time processing
: emergent technologies like edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) require real-time data processing. Distributed systems enable data to be processed closer to its source, reducing latency and improving response times, which is vital for applications such as autonomous driving, industrial automation, and remote health monitoring.

Data privacy and security
: In distributed systems, data can be processed locally, which enhances privacy and security by reducing the need to transmit sensitive information over potentially insecure networks. This is particularly important for applications in healthcare, finance, and other sectors that handle sensitive data.

Cost-effectiveness
: Distributed computing can be more cost-effective than traditional centralized systems. By leveraging clusters of low-cost machines, organizations can achieve high performance without the need for expensive, high-end hardware.

# Excursus: The Decentralized Web {.headline-only}

## Problem statement

. . .

:::medium
The internet as it is today^[The internet as of today is often termed Web 2.0] is increasingly dominated by a few large platforms^[Dominant internet players are the large platforms for e.g., social media, marketplaces, and CDN] and cloud service providers^[The internet big five, also known as GAFAM, are Google, Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook), Apple, and Microsoft] — [counteracting the original decentralized nature of the internet]{.link-color}.
:::

:::notes

**Reasons**

Network effects
:  Web 2.0 platforms thrive on network effects. The more users a platform has, the more valuable it becomes to others who want to join. This creates a snowball effect, making it difficult for new competitors to gain traction.  

Data advantage
:  The dominant companies collect vast amounts of user data on their platforms. This data allows them to personalize user experiences, target advertising effectively, and develop new features that keep users engaged. It's a cycle that feeds itself – the more data they have, the better their services become, attracting more users and even more data.

Barriers to entry
:  Building and maintaining large-scale web infrastructure is expensive.  It requires significant investments in servers, data centers, and content delivery networks. This creates a barrier for new players to compete with established giants who already have this infrastructure in place.

ISPs and control of access
:  ISPs (Internet Service Providers) act as the gatekeepers to the internet. They can potentially influence the speed and accessibility of certain websites, giving an edge to well-established platforms that have negotiated deals with them.

Regulations and laws
:  The current regulatory landscape might favor existing companies.  It can be challenging for new startups to navigate complex data privacy laws and copyright regulations.

## Web 3.0 applications

@murray2023promise propose that following four key  applications could play a significant role in Web3:

:::medium
[[Cryptocurrencies]{.highlight-current-blue .fragment fragment-index=1}, ]{.fragment fragment-index=1}\
[[Metaverses]{.highlight-current-blue .fragment fragment-index=2}, ]{.fragment fragment-index=2}\
[[NFTs]{.highlight-current-blue .fragment fragment-index=3}^[NFT stands for Non-fungible Tokens], and]{.fragment fragment-index=3}\
[[DAOs]{.highlight-current-blue .fragment fragment-index=4}^[ DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations]]{.fragment fragment-index=4}
:::

:::notes
Cryptocurrencies
: Digital tokens that can be used for secure online transactions without relying on banks. Think of them like digital money, but not controlled by any one government. These digital tokens could be the fuel for Web3, facilitating transactions and potentially serving as a unit of account within decentralized applications.

Metaverses
: Immersive virtual worlds accessed through VR or AR technology. Users can interact with each other, own virtual land or items (potentially as NFTs), and participate in various activities. These virtual worlds could be a major platform for Web3 experiences, where users interact, spend their crypto, and potentially own virtual assets as NFTs.

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
: Unique digital certificates that represent ownership of digital assets like artwork, music, or even virtual items within a Metaverse. Unlike currencies, each NFT is one-of-a-kind. NFTs could represent ownership of digital assets within the Metaverse and potentially other Web3 applications. Imagine using an NFT to represent your unique avatar in a virtual world.

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
: Online communities with shared goals, governed by rules encoded on a blockchain (a secure digital ledger).  Decisions are made collectively by members through voting with tokens they own. DAOs could be a way to govern online communities and manage resources within Web3 projects. For instance, a DAO could oversee a virtual world within the Metaverse.

:::notes

**Service-based IT resources**

- All cloud offerings can be expressed as a service
- Each service comes with a Service Level Agreement, defining functions and qualities

**On demand self-service**

- A consumer can provide computing capacity (e.g., server time, network storage and user licenses) unilaterally and automatically as required
- No need for human interaction with a service provider

**Ubiquitous access**

- Cloud services are provisioned via the Internet or private networks
- Cloud service rely on standardized interfaces to ease interaction
- Consumption by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations)

**Multitenancy**

- The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
- Using a multi tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand
- Sharing computing resources is part of what could makes cloud computing economically beneficial

**Location independence**

- There is a sense of location independence in that the cloud customer generally has no control over or knowledge of where the provided resources are actually located
- This challenges providers to be compliant with existing data protection requirements, among others

**Rapid elasticity**

- Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand
- To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time

**Pay per use billing**

- Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts)
- Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service
