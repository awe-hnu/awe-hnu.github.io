# Task

You will dig deeper in two key areas academic research (in IS) and document your learnings in two short papers and a presentation.

:::html-hidden
:::large
[A important theoretical lens used in IS]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and your research design.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

# Deliverables

You need to deliver following parts via Moodle:

:::{.incremental}
- __Theory presentation__\
  Brief introduction of a theoretical lens to explore phenomena of interest (group of two students, 10 minutes plus Q&A),
- __Method paper__\
  Presentation and justification of your research design (approx. 4 pages; details see [template](assets/ISR_Method-Paper_Template.docx)),
:::

. . .

For deadlines, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

The deliverables are graded individually and determine the grade with the following weights:

:::medium
:::{.incremental}
- 40% __theory presentation__
- 60% __method paper__ 
- plus bonus points[^bonus]
:::
:::

. . .

__Note:__ Compliance with formal requirements (see templates) and good scientific practice are critical pass criteria for all parts, means that in case of non-compliance the exam is automatically failed (e.g., plagiarism, even light forms).

[^bonus]: The bonus points are assigned based on your engagement in the lectures. These can improve your performance by up to one grade increments (up to .7).

## Theory presentation

An presentation that fulfills the expectations has the following characteristics:

:::incremental
- The theory with it building blocks is described concisely.
- The origins of the theory, including its seminal papers work, are outlined.
- Students use concise examples to clearly illustrate the theory.
- Student raises interest and uses a clear voice so that all audience members can follow the presentation.
- Presentation is attractive, text is legible, graphics and effects are used throughout to enhance presentation.
- Student presents information in logical, interesting sequence which audience can follow.
- Student demonstrates good knowledge by answering all questions with explanations and elaboration.
- Literature is cited sufficiently, correctly and consistently.

## Method paper

An excellent paper has the following characteristics:

:::incremental
- The research problem its objectives are comprehensible.
- The theoretical lens of the research is presented briefly and concisely.
- All relevant aspects of the research design are identified and clearly explained.
- The justification of the methodological decisions is convincing.
- The research design allows for a valid and reliable contribution.
- Literature is cited sufficiently, correctly and consistently.

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum. 
:::

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` — very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` — good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a “good performance”.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an “average   performance”*                                                                                             |
| `3` — satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` — sufficient             | [A   performance that “still adequately satisfies” the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` — not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}
