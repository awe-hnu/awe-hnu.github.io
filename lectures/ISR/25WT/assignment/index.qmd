# Task

You will dig deeper in two key areas academic research (in IS) and document your learnings in two short papers and a presentation.

:::large
[A important theoretical lens used in IS]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and your research design.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

# Deliverables

You need to deliver following parts via Moodle:

:::html-hidden
:::incremental
- __Theory presentation__\
  Brief introduction of a theoretical lens to explore phenomena of interest (group of two students, 10 minutes plus Q&A),
- __Method paper__\
  Presentation and justification of your research design (approx. 4 pages; details see [template](assets/ISR_Method-Paper_Template.docx)),
:::

:::notes

Theory presentation
: A 10-minute group presentation (2 students) introducing a theoretical lens used in Information Systems research. You'll explain the theory's core building blocks, trace its origins and seminal works, and demonstrate its current applications in IS through concrete examples. The presentation should engage the audience with clear delivery and attractive visuals while demonstrating deep theoretical understanding through Q&A responses.

Method paper
: A short individual paper presenting and justifying your research design (following the provided [template](assets/ISR_Method-Paper_Template.docx)). You'll clearly articulate your research problem, objectives, and theoretical foundations, then identify and explain all relevant methodological aspects with convincing justification. The design should demonstrate how your approach will yield valid and reliable contributions to IS research.

Both assignments serve to deepen your understanding of IS theory and methodology while helping you conceptualize your master's thesis research design.

# Grading

The deliverables are graded individually and determine the grade with the following weights:

:::medium
:::{.incremental}
- 40% __theory presentation__
- 60% __method paper__ 
- plus bonus points[^bonus]
:::
:::

. . .

__Note:__ Compliance with formal requirements (see templates) and good scientific practice are critical pass criteria for all parts, means that in case of non-compliance the exam is automatically failed (e.g., plagiarism, even light forms).

[^bonus]: The bonus points are assigned based on your engagement in the lectures. These can improve your performance by up to one grade increments (up to .7).

## Theory presentation

An presentation that fulfills the expectations has the following characteristics:

:::incremental
- The presentation meets the requirements of good scientific practice (passing criteria).
- The theory with it building blocks is described concisely.
- The origins of the theory, including its seminal papers work, are outlined.
- Current examples in IS research are given to illustrate applications of the theory.
- Student raises interest and uses a clear voice so that all audience members can follow the presentation.
- Presentation is attractive, text is legible, graphics and effects are used throughout to enhance presentation.
- Student presents information in logical, interesting sequence which audience can follow.
- Student demonstrates good knowledge by answering all questions with explanations and elaboration.

## Method paper

An excellent paper has the following characteristics:

:::incremental
- The paper meets the requirements of good scientific practice (passing criteria).
- The research problem, its objectives and the theoretical foundations are presented concisely but clearly.
- All relevant aspects of the research design are identified and clearly explained.
- The justification of the methodological decisions is convincing.
- The research design allows for a valid and reliable contribution.

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum. 
:::

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` — very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` — good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a “good performance”.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an “average   performance”*                                                                                             |
| `3` — satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` — sufficient             | [A   performance that “still adequately satisfies” the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` — not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}
