## Definition

A concept is an abstract idea, notion, or mental representation that represents a specific category of objects, events, behaviors, or phenomena [@podsakoff2016recommendations].

::: notes
Concepts are fundamental to

-   human cognition and communication in general, as they enable us to organize and make sense of the complex world around us; and
-   research in the organizational, behavioral, and social sciences, as they serve as a **building block for theories, hypotheses, and empirical investigations** [@podsakoff2016recommendations].

Concepts can vary in complexity, ranging from simple and well-defined ideas to more complex and multidimensional constructs. They are typically developed based on experience, that

-   can be of *real phenomena* (e.g., weight) as well as of some *latent phenomena* that we can agree upon (e.g., usefulness), and
-   can be linked to one another via propositions.

## Importance

:::: html-hidden
Science is built on the cumulative advancement of knowledge that requires rigor.\
In this regard, concepts enable e.g.

::: notes
Well-defined concepts are crucial for theoretical development, empirical testing, and communication among researchers. They provide a solid foundation for scientific inquiry by guiding research design, measurement, analysis, and communication. They contribute to the reliability, validity, and credibility of scientific findings, fostering progress and innovation in the respective fields of study. Poor concept definitions can result in measurement problems, misinterpretations, and difficulties in replicating studies [@podsakoff2016recommendations].

Cumulative knowledge

:   Science is built on the cumulative advancement of knowledge. Clear definitions ensure that the progress made in one study can be built upon by subsequent studies. Inaccurate or vague definitions can lead to confusion and contradictory findings, hindering the cumulative nature of scientific discovery.

Theoretical development

:   Clear concept definitions are the foundation of theoretical development in any scientific discipline. Well-defined concepts provide a common language and framework for researchers to build and refine theories, leading to a more organized and systematic understanding of phenomena.

Empirical research

:   In empirical research, clear conceptual definitions are crucial for designing experiments, surveys, and other research methods. If concepts are not well-defined, researchers may struggle to accurately measure and assess them, leading to inconsistent or unreliable results.

Replication and verification

:   Replicating research is a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. Without clear concept definitions, replication becomes difficult or even impossible, as different researchers might interpret and operationalize concepts differently, undermining the validity of the findings.

Validation and theory testing

:   Clear concepts are essential for testing and validating theories. Researchers can assess whether a concept behaves as expected based on its definition, allowing for the refinement and improvement of theoretical frameworks.

Communication and collaboration

:   Clear definitions facilitate effective communication among researchers. When concepts are defined precisely, there is less room for ambiguity or misunderstanding. Researchers can collaborate more efficiently, share insights, and contribute to the accumulation of knowledge.

Academic rigor

:   Precise and well-defined concepts demonstrate a commitment to academic rigor and intellectual honesty. Researchers who take the time to carefully define their concepts show their dedication to producing high-quality and reliable research.

Theoretical and practical applications

:   Clear concepts enable the translation of scientific findings into practical applications. Whether in business, policy-making, or other fields, well-defined concepts ensure that research insights can be effectively applied to real-world situations.
:::

## Guidelines

@podsakoff2016recommendations propose a set of recommendations for creating better concept definitions:

:::: html-hidden
::: large
[clear and precise,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[differentiated,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[explicit &]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}\
[theoretically founded]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
::::

::: notes

Clarity and precision

:   Concept definitions should be clear, concise, and unambiguous. Authors should avoid jargon and complex language that might obscure the intended meaning.

Differentiation

:   Concepts should be clearly differentiated from related concepts. Authors should explicitly state the boundaries of the concept and explain how it differs from similar terms.

Explicitness

:   Authors should explicitly specify the elements, dimensions, or components that constitute the concept. This helps readers understand the concept's structure and characteristics.

Descriptive and functional information

:   Definitions should include both descriptive information (what the concept is) and functional information (how it operates or affects other variables).

Theoretical foundation

:   Concept definitions should be grounded in relevant theories and existing literature. Authors should connect their definitions to established concepts and frameworks.

Measurement implications

:   Authors should consider the practical implications of their concept definitions for measurement. A well-defined concept should have clear measurement indicators.

Multiple perspectives

:   Authors should acknowledge that different perspectives may exist for a concept, and they should strive to incorporate these various viewpoints into their definition.

Dynamic nature

:   Some concepts may evolve over time or vary across contexts. Authors should address this dynamism in their definitions.

:::

::: notes
Concepts need to be operationalized to something in the real world that can be measured. The concept education, for instance, could be operationalized as “highest degree earned”, which in turn could be measured by ascertaining what type of course (high school, under-graduate, post-graduate, etcetera) a person had completed [@recker2021research].

Most constructs are composed of a multidimensional set of underlying concepts. Intelligence, for example, can hardly be measured with just one variable, since we understand this concept to include abilities such as abstract thinking, comprehension, communication, reasoning, learning, planning, problem solving, and others, including the emotional intelligence mentioned above. We refer to such constructs as multidimensional constructs because they have multiple underlying dimensions, all of which are relevant to our understanding and use of the construct and, consequently, all of which we need to measure separately through specific variables. The example of intelligence shows why there is the IQ score (intelligence quotient), which is the standardized result of a complex test that includes measurement variables to determine the intelligence level of individuals alongside a number of ability dimensions such as abstract thinking, communication, creativity, learning, memory, problem solving, reasoning, visual processing, and others.

## Definition

@sutton1995theory define theory as a comprehensive framework that [goes beyond simple descriptions, hypotheses, data, or metaphors]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}. A true theory [provides a systematic and explanatory understanding of a set of phenomena]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms and causal relationships.

::: incremental
-   Theory is about **the connections between phenomena**, a story about why actions, events, structures, and thoughts occur.
-   Theory emphasizes **the nature of causal relationships** by determining what occurs first and the timing of such events.
-   Theory delves into the underlying processes to understand **the systematic reasons for a particular event or non-event**.
-   The theory is usually accompanied by **a series of convincing and logically coherent arguments**.
:::

## What theory is not

@sutton1995theory argue that theory is often misunderstood and misused in academic and scholarly contexts. They provide a clear distinction between what theory is and what it is not:

[Universal]{.fragment .strike}, [data]{.fragment .strike}, [descriptive]{.fragment .strike}, [hypotheses]{.fragment .strike}, [models]{.fragment .strike}, [design]{.fragment .strike}
:::
::::

::: notes

Theory is not data

:   Data alone is not theory. Data provides evidence and information, but theory involves interpreting and making sense of the data by providing underlying principles or causal mechanisms.

Theory is not descriptive

:   Theory is not merely a description of observed phenomena. It goes beyond summarizing empirical findings and involves explaining why and how certain patterns or relationships occur.

Theory is not hypotheses

:   While hypotheses are specific statements or predictions derived from theory, theory itself is a broader framework that provides a coherent explanation for a set of related phenomena (*the why*).

Theory is not trivial insights

:   Theory should offer more than just common-sense observations or insights. A true theory provides a systematic and organized understanding that extends beyond obvious observations.

Theory is not model building

:   While models can illustrate the components and relationships within a theory, the authors assert that creating models is not the same as developing a theory. Theory involves explaining the logic and rationale behind the model.
:::

## Function

::: large
Theories guide and give meaning to what we see.
:::

::: incremental
-   Help to organize relevant empirical facts (i.e., what can be observed and measured) to provide description, explanation or prediction of phenomena
-   Allow us to generalize from „the known“ to „the unknown“ (e.g., guide the design of artefacts)
:::

## Scientific theories

Theory is something we use all the time in our everyday life to construct explanations about the world in which we live.

. . .

**What is specific to scientific theories?**

. . .

According to @bacharach1989organizational, a scientific theory

::: incremental
-   helps us to synthesize prior empirical findings and to reconcile contradictory findings by discovering contingent factors;
-   can be empirically tested using scientific methods;
-   needs to be able to be falsified, but not necessarily to be proven positive;
-   offers guidance for future research by helping identify constructs (reflecting concepts) and hypotheses (relationships between the constructs)
-   contributes to cumulative knowledge by bridging gaps between theories and causing existing theories to be re-evaluated

::: notes
![Levels of theory](images/theory-types.svg){#fig-levels}

High-level theories are usually known by their more-common label of “perspectives”. A *perspective* is simply a way of looking at and understanding the world or social constructions within it. Different researchers, working within different perspectives, construct different theories about the nature of that world. Mid-range and low-level theories are often based on the principles underpinning these persepctives. Thus, if you understand the basic principles of high-level theories, you will find it easier to understand other types of theory.

::: notes
@gregor2006nature elaborates five types of theories used in information systems research.

I Analysis

:   The theory says **what is**. It does not extend beyond analysis and description. No causal relationships among phenomena are specified and no predictions are made. Example: Gregor's Types of Theory.

II Explanation

:   The theory says **what is, how, why, when, and where**. It provides explanations but does not aim to predict with any precision. There are no testable propositions. Example: Adaptive Structuration Theory.

III Prediction

:   The theory says **what is and what will be**. It provides predictions and has testable propositions but does not have well developed justificatory causal explanations. Example: Moore' Law.

IV Explanation and prediction

:   The theory says **what is, how, why, when, where, and what will be**. It provides predictions and has both testable propositions and causal explanations. Example: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).

V Design and action

:   The theory says **how to do something**. It gives explicit prescriptions (e.g., methods, techniques, principles of form and function) for constructing an artifact. Example: Progressive Learning Theory — "learning by doing".

## Concepts and constructs

::: large
The "what" of theories.
:::

::: notes
Concepts and constructs form the "what” of theories [@whetten1989constitutes].
:::

::: incremental
-   A construct is the operationalization of a concept that is chosen to explain the phenomenon [@podsakoff2016recommendations].
-   Constructs must have clear and **unambiguous operational definition** that should specify exactly how the construct will be measured and at what level of analysis (individual, group, organizational, etc.).
-   The constructs included in a theory must be **equally comprehensive and parsimonious**—all relevant concepts are included but but only those that enhance understanding [@whetten1989constitutes].
:::

## Propositions and hypotheses

::: large
The "how" of theories.
:::

::: notes
Propositions and hypotheses form the "how” of theories.
:::

. . .

Propositions are associations postulated at the theoretical level (they relate concepts), hypotheses are tested at the empirical level (they relate constructs) [@whetten1989constitutes].

::: incremental
-   Propositions are stated in **declarative form** and should ideally indicate a **cause-effect relationship** (e.g., if X occurs, then Y will follow).
-   Propositions may be speculative but must be testable, and should be rejected if they are not supported by empirical observations.

## Logic

::: large
The "why" of theories.
:::

. . .

The logic provides the basis for justifying the propositions as postulated [@whetten1989constitutes].

::: incremental
-   Acts like a “glue” that **connects the theoretical constructs and provides meaning** and relevance to the relationships between these constructs.
-   **Represents the “explanation”** that lies at the core of a theory.
:::

. . .

Without logic, propositions will be ad hoc, random, and meaningless

## Boundary conditions

::: large
The **constraints** of theories.
:::

::: incremental
-   Assumptions about values, time, and space that govern where the theory can be applied and where it cannot be applied—**the boundaries of generalizability** [@whetten1989constitutes].
-   If a theory is to be properly used or tested, **all its implicit assumptions must be properly understood** (e.g., cultural assumptions, temporal assumptions, or spatial assumptions)
-   Although it is important to consider potential constraints through theory development, these boundaries **are usually discovered through subsequent tests**.

## Conclusion

# Theorizing {.headline-only}

## Definition

::: medium
Theorizing is the application or development of theoretical arguments to make sense of a real account (e.g. an observed phenomenon) [@recker2021research].
:::

::: incremental
-   Theorizing can be inductive, deductive or abductive.
-   Theorizing can be dependent on data analysis, creative thinking, inspiration, or good luck.
:::

## Principles

Theory is always a **simplification**
:::

:::fragment
It should not be more complex than the phenomenon to be investigated.

#### From theory to data {visibility=hidden}

Typically called the ‘traditional’ scientific process

-   You start with a theory.
-   You develop a modification or an extension of it
-   Then you collect data specifically to test/falsify the predictions

#### From data to theory {visibility=hidden}

Often equated with inductive and interpretive research

-   You start with data, with a study of something that is ‘really happening’
-   You examine whether there is no theory to explain what you observe
-   You start developing a novel theoretical account, “grounded” in the data

::::

:::fragment
The approaches are not mutually exclusive, and researchers often combine elements from multiple approaches depending on 
the research context.
:::

:::fragment
The choice depends on the **research question, available data, and the goals of the study**.
:::

::: notes

#### Theory building {visibility=hidden}

Building theory involves the development of new theoretical frameworks or explanatory models to understand a phenomenon. This process often starts with empirical observations or data collection. Researchers use inductive or abductive approaches to identify patterns, relationships, and underlying mechanisms. They formulate conceptual frameworks that capture these patterns and explain the observed phenomenon. Building theory is particularly useful when there is a lack of established theoretical foundations for a specific area of study [@mueller2017understanding].

#### Theory testing {visibility=hidden}

Testing theory involves subjecting existing theoretical frameworks or models to empirical scrutiny to assess their validity and predictive power. Researchers use deductive testing to generate hypotheses based on established theories and then gather data to confirm or refute these hypotheses. Inductive testing, on the other hand, uses empirical observations to challenge or refine existing theories. The goal of testing theory is to assess whether a theory accurately represents the real-world phenomenon and whether its predictions hold up under empirical examination.

#### Theory extending {visibility=hidden}

Extending theory refers to the process of enhancing or expanding existing theoretical frameworks to refine and broaden their applicability, accommodating new empirical findings and addressing limitations.

Researchers can extend theory in several ways:

-   Conceptual extension: This involves introducing new concepts, dimensions, or variables to an existing theory, enriching its explanatory scope and relevance.
-   Theoretical extension: Researchers extend theory by adding new relationships, mechanisms, or components to an existing framework. This expands the theory's ability to explain complex phenomena.
-   Interdisciplinary extension: Extending theory by integrating insights and concepts from other disciplines, bridging gaps and enriching the theoretical foundations.

## Quality checks

@recker2021research, @mueller2017understanding and others propose that you have a good theory when you have answer to the following questions:

::: incremental
-   Is your account insightful, challenging, perhaps surprising, and–importantly–**does it seem to make sense**?
-   Is your account (your arguments) **testable** (falsifiable)?
-   Do you have **convincing evidence** to support your account?
-   Is your account **parsimonious**?
-   Are the arguments **logical**?
-   What can you say about the **boundary conditions** of the theory?
-   What are **implications** of your theory?
:::

## How to theorize — example

Start with an **observation**

::: incremental
-   Think about being in college. You're in class, and the guy next to you —who is obviously a football player— says 
    an unbelievably dumb thing in class. Why?[^1]
-   Initial theory: *Football players are dumb.*
:::

[^1]: The example draws from @lave1993introduction.

. . .

Theories should be about classes of things, i.e., more **general**[^2].

[^2]: Theories that are too narrow and specific (i.e., low-level theories) are not very interesting, even if they are correct.

::: incremental
-   New theory: *Athletes are dumb.*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Theories should be explanatory. Moreover, they should be free of circular arguments as circularity prevents theories from being **falsifiable**.

::: incremental
-   Dumbness cannot be directly observed or measured. The only way we can know if people are dumb is by what they 
    say and do. So we say that they say dumb things because they are dumb.
-   New theory: *To be a good athlete requires lots of practice time; being smart in class also requires study time. Amount of time is limited, so practicing a sport means less studying which means being less smart in class.*
:::

. . .

A good theory is general enough to generate implications for other groups of people and other contexts, all of which serve as potential tests of the theory (i.e., the theory is **fertile**).

::: incremental
-   We can shift the focus from an enduring property of a class of people (athletes) to a **mechanism**. This means that we can apply the same reasoning to other people and other situations.
-   New theory: *There is limited time in a day, so when a person engages in a very time-consuming activity, such as athletics, it takes away from other very time-consuming activities, such as studying* (Limited Time Theory).
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often, we find that there are also other explanations:

::: incremental
-   *Everyone has a need to excel in one area. Achieving excellence in any one area is enough to satisfy this need. Football players satisfy their need for accomplishment through football, so they are not motivated to be smart in class* (Excellence Theory).
-   *We are jealous of others’ success. When we are jealous, we subconsciously lower our evaluation of that person’s performance in other areas. So we think football players ask dumb questions* (Jealousy Theory).
:::

. . .

We need to study different contexts to see how our theories explain observations.

::: incremental
-   Depending on the context, each theory leads to other expectations, e.g.,
    -   Football players ask dumb questions out of season?
    -   Will athletes who do not look like athletes ask dumb questions?
-   The **expectations of our theory lead to hypotheses** that can be tested by empirical research.
