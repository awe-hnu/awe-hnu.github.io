:::notes
Design science research is "a research paradigm in which a designer answers questions relevant to human problems via the creation of innovative artefacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of scientific evidence. The designed artefacts are both useful and fundamental in understanding that problem" [@hevner2010design, p. 5].

- Knowledge and understanding about a problem and its solution are gained by the creation and application of an artifacts
- Predominant research methodology used in engineering and computer science, partially also in IS research as well as other disciplines

## Nature of the problem

Design science research in IS addresses what are considered to be *wicked problems* [@hevner2010design, p. 11].

:::incremental
- Unstable requirements and constraints based on **ill-defined environmental contexts**,
- **complex interactions** among subcomponents of the problem,
- **inherent flexibility** to change design processes as well as design artifacts (i.e., malleable processes and artifacts),
- a critical dependence upon **human cognitive abilities** (e.g., creativity) to produce effective solutions, and
- a critical dependence upon **human social abilities** (e.g., teamwork) to produce effective solutions

In design science, the research interest is on creating or changing **human-created, artificial objects** (i.e., artefacts) with the aim of improving on existing solutions to problems or perhaps providing a first solution to a problem [@recker2021research].

. . .

Different types of artefacts exist [@hevner2010design, p.6]:

- Constructs (vocabulary and symbols)
- Models (abstractions and representations)
- Methods (algorithms and practices)
- Instantiations (implemented and prototype systems)
- Design theories (improved models of design or design processes)

The context in which specific phenomena of interest occur is called the **environment.** In the realm of information systems research, this environment encompasses elements like people, organizational structures, and existing digital technologies. For any given project, the environment needs to justify why a particular artifact, which is the central focus of design science research, holds significance for stakeholders in that specific field.

The **knowledge base** serves as the foundation for conducting design science research. It's made up of previous research, findings from related disciplines, and a range of tools, models, methods, and theories that are available for use during the design phase. The knowledge base plays a crucial role in ensuring that design science maintains rigor.

Connecting the research project's context and the design science activities is the **relevance cycle**; the **rigor cycle** links design science activities with the foundational scientific principles, experience, and expertise found in the knowledge base. The core **design cycle** continually loops between constructing and assessing the design artifact, closely interacting with research processes.

@hevner2007three emphasizes that these three cycles—the relevance cycle, the rigor cycle, and the central design cycle—need to be clearly recognizable in any design science research project.

## Evaluation criteria

A primary criterion for evaluating design science is the **demonstrated utility** of the design artifact, which also presents a significant challenge. 

. . .

Utility refers to an improvement that goes beyond the current level of usefulness. This definition also implies three essential criteria that must be fulfilled:

:::incremental
1. The demonstrated utility of the artifact should be **innovative and original**.
2. The artifact's should bring about **a positive difference** when compared to existing solutions.
3. The artifact's superiority in utility should be convincingly **proven through a thorough evaluation**.
:::

:::notes
The interpretation of *utility* can vary. It might be expressed as a performance measure, indicating the degree of enhancement a new artifact offers over an existing solution. Alternatively, it could be gauged through end users' perspectives, considering factors like efficacy, efficiency, effectiveness, or other relevant criteria. In some cases, utility could even be understood in terms of humanistic aspects like aesthetics or the sense of pleasure it provides.

The DSRP model proposed by @peffers2007design provides a structured approach for conducting design science research, emphasizing the creation of practical solutions to real-world problems while ensuring rigor through evaluation and communication of results.

- **Problem identification:** This phase involves identifying a relevant and significant problem in the context of information systems. Researchers explore the problem's practical implications and motivations, ensuring that it aligns with the needs of practitioners or organizations.
- **Definition of objectives:** Researchers define clear objectives for designing a solution to the identified problem. These objectives outline what the designed artifact aims to achieve and the benefits it should provide.
- **Design and development:** In this phase, researchers design and develop the innovative artifact as a solution to the problem. This involves creating a detailed design, building the artifact, and ensuring it aligns with the defined objectives.
- **Demonstration:** The developed artifact is demonstrated to stakeholders, practitioners, or experts to showcase its functionality and potential benefits. Feedback is gathered to assess the artifact's initial usability and feasibility.
- **Evaluation:** The artifact's effectiveness, efficiency, and utility are rigorously evaluated using appropriate evaluation methods. This phase aims to determine the artifact's impact on solving the identified problem and whether it meets the defined objectives.
- **Communication:** The final phase involves communicating the results of the design science research. Researchers document their findings, insights, and lessons learned. This documentation contributes to the body of knowledge in the field and helps practitioners understand and apply the developed artifact.
