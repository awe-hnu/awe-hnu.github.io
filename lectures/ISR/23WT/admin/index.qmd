# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

:::large
Research aims to advance **understanding of reality** before providing advice on how to change it. 
:::

:::notes
This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of IS research through a combination of classroom instruction and independent study. The course is also designed to help you make significant progress on your master's thesis, in particular in narrowing down the topic, understanding the theory and finding a suitable method.
:::

# Contents

Research is the systematic study and investigation of an area of problem or interest. It begins with the analysis of a situation itself and aims to find out the causes and characteristics of the problem. 

. . .

This course teaches you **the basics required to carry-out your own research project** (e.g., as part of your master's thesis), particularly regarding: 

:::incremental
- **Theory of science** and knowledge acquisition
- **Basic principles of research** (in IS)
- The **research process**
- The **role and nature of theory**
- **Research design** with a focus on the basics of quantitative and qualitative research methods as well as design science research
:::

# Learning outcomes

You will advance your knowledge and skills in following areas.

::: {.incremental}
- Understanding the fundamentals of **doing sound research** and the need for focus (especially the formulation of appropriate research questions).
- Understanding the need for **theory-guided explanations** of real-world phenomenon and approaches and the **nature and role of theory** in IS research.
- Ability to chose **adequate research methods** depending on the research objective (incl. related data acquisition and data analysis techniques)
- **Crafting own theoretical contributions** and evaluating those of others, while maintaining academic integrity and uphold the standards of good academic work.
:::

# Learning set-up

This course combines class teaching with brief exercises, coaching, and self-learning components.

. . .

The **self-learning components** are necessary to prepare and reflect the teaching sessions and to pass the assignment.

. . .

The focus of the **teaching sessions** is on giving you input to the fundamentals of IS research and to reflect those. 

. . .

The **personal coaching sessions** will help you move forward with your assignment.

. . .

The learning progress is reflected in a written [assignment](../assignment/) (seminar paper) that could also serve as a foundation for your master's thesis.


## Effort

You will gain 5 ECTS for this course. This equals min. **125 hours workload** for an average student required to  pass the course.

::: {.incremental}
-	Joint sessions including preparation, reflections and coaching: **approx. 30 hours**
-	Assignment (manuscript, review, revision, presentation): **approx. 95 hours**
