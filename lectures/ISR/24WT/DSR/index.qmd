::: notes
Design science research is "a research paradigm in which a designer
answers questions relevant to human problems via the creation of
innovative artefacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of
scientific evidence. The designed artefacts are both useful and
fundamental in understanding that problem" [@hevner2010design, p. 5].

-   Knowledge and understanding about a problem and its solution are
    gained by the creation and application of an artefacts
-   Predominant research methodology used in engineering and computer
    science, partially also in IS research as well as other disciplines

## Nature of the problem

Design science research (DSR) in IS addresses what are considered to be
*wicked problems*, that are problems that are difficult to define and
solve due to their interconnected and evolving nature
[@hevner2010design, p. 11]:

::: incremental
-   The problem itself is not well-defined and can change over time,
    also because of **ill-defined environmental contexts**.
-   The problem is complex and there are **many interrelated
    subcomponents/factors** that make it difficult to isolate.
-   Solutions are neither right nor wrong, but better or worse. Each
    solution can lead to new problems, which is why we need to rely on
    our **human cognitive abilities** (e.g. creativity).
-   The involvement of multiple stakeholders with disparate perspectives
    and interests renders consensus a challenging objective. The
    production of effective solutions necessitates the deployment of
    **collective human social abilities** (e.g., teamnwork).
:::

. . .

DSR requires **inherent flexibility** to change design processes as well
as design artefacts (i.e., malleable processes and artefacts).

design science process.

In design science, the research interest is on creating or changing
**human-created, artificial objects** (i.e., artefacts) with the aim of
improving on existing solutions to problems or perhaps providing a first
solution to a problem [@recker2021research].

. . .

Different types of artefacts exist [@hevner2010design, p.6]:

-   Constructs (vocabulary and symbols)
-   Models (abstractions and representations)
-   Methods (algorithms and practices)
-   Instantiations (implemented and prototype systems)
-   Design theories (improved models of design or design processes)

![A three cycle view of design science research
[@hevner2007three]](images/process.svg){#fig-dsr-process}

The context in which specific phenomena of interest occur is called the
**environment.** In the realm of information systems research, this
environment encompasses elements like people, organizational structures,
and existing digital technologies. For any given project, the
environment needs to justify why a particular artefact, which is the
central focus of design science research, holds significance for
stakeholders in that specific field.

The **knowledge base** serves as the foundation for conducting design
science research. It's made up of previous research, findings from
related disciplines, and a range of tools, models, methods, and theories
that are available for use during the design phase. The knowledge base
plays a crucial role in ensuring that design science maintains rigor.

Connecting the research project's context and the design science
activities is the **relevance cycle**; the **rigor cycle** links design
science activities with the foundational scientific principles,
experience, and expertise found in the knowledge base. The core **design
cycle** continually loops between constructing and assessing the design
artefact, closely interacting with research processes.

@hevner2007three emphasizes that these three cycles---the relevance
cycle, the rigor cycle, and the central design cycle---need to be
clearly recognizable in any design science research project.
:::

## Evaluation criteria

A primary criterion for evaluating design science is the **demonstrated
utility** of the design artefact, which also presents a significant
challenge.

. . .

Utility refers to an improvement that goes beyond the current level of
usefulness. This definition also implies three essential criteria that
must be fulfilled:

::: incremental
1.  The demonstrated utility of the artefact should be **innovative and
    original**.
2.  The artefact's should bring about **a positive difference** when
    compared to existing solutions.
3.  The artefact's superiority in utility should be convincingly
    **proven through a thorough evaluation**.
:::

::: notes
The interpretation of *utility* can vary. It might be expressed as a
performance measure, indicating the degree of enhancement a new artefact
offers over an existing solution. Alternatively, it could be gauged
through end users' perspectives, considering factors like efficacy,
efficiency, effectiveness, or other relevant criteria. In some cases,
utility could even be understood in terms of humanistic aspects like
aesthetics or the sense of pleasure it provides.

The DSRP model proposed by @peffers2007design provides a structured
approach for conducting design science research, emphasizing the
creation of practical solutions to real-world problems while ensuring
rigor through evaluation and communication of results.

-   **Problem identification:** This phase involves identifying a
    relevant and significant problem in the context of information
    systems. Researchers explore the problem's practical implications
    and motivations, ensuring that it aligns with the needs of
    practitioners or organizations.
-   **Definition of objectives:** Researchers define clear objectives
    for designing a solution to the identified problem. These objectives
    outline what the designed artefact aims to achieve and the benefits
    it should provide.
-   **Design and development:** In this phase, researchers design and
    develop the innovative artefact as a solution to the problem. This
    involves creating a detailed design, building the artefact, and
    ensuring it aligns with the defined objectives.
-   **Demonstration:** The developed artefact is demonstrated to
    stakeholders, practitioners, or experts to showcase its
    functionality and potential benefits. Feedback is gathered to assess
    the artefact's initial usability and feasibility.
-   **Evaluation:** The artefact's effectiveness, efficiency, and
    utility are rigorously evaluated using appropriate evaluation
    methods. This phase aims to determine the artefact's impact on
    solving the identified problem and whether it meets the defined
    objectives.
-   **Communication:** The final phase involves communicating the
    results of the design science research. Researchers document their
    findings, insights, and lessons learned. This documentation
    contributes to the body of knowledge in the field and helps
    practitioners understand and apply the developed artefact.
