# Task

You will prepare a __proposal for your master's thesis__, thereby going through __a complete process of writing and publishing an academic paper__ (topic, strategy, narrative, review, revision, presentation).

You need to apply what you have learned and create __multiple deliverables__. The deliverables are usually created during a writing and publication cycle. In addition, you get feedback from both, your peer students as well as the Professors.

The deliverables reflect your learning progress and are graded individually.


# Deliverables

You need to deliver following parts via Moodle:

- __Extended proposal__ (initial version) for your master thesis (details see [template](assets/AW_Proposal_Template.docx))
- __Two reviews__ of fellow students' proposal (details see [template](assets/AW_Review_Template.docx))
- __Revision__ of your proposal incl. __response letter__ (details see [template](assets/AW_ResponseLetter_Template.docx))
- __Lessons learned__ (1 page reflection; append it to your revision)

For deadlines, pelase see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

The exam parts are graded individually and are included in the overall grade with the following proportions:

- 30% __extended proposal__, 
- 30% __reviews__, 
- 30% __revision__, and
- 10% __lessons learned__

. . .

__Note:__ Compliance with formal requirements (see templates) and good scientific practice are critical pass criteria for all parts, means that in case of non-compliance the exam is automatically failed (e.g., plagiarism, even light forms).
