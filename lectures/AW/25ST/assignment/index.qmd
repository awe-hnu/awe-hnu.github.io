# Task

:::medium
You need to apply what you have learned and prepare a __proposal for your master's thesis__.
:::

You will go through key academic writing processes over the course of the semester, from finding a topic, writing a proposal, presenting your idea and getting feedback, writing a research in progress paper and reflecting on your learning progress. You will complete several deliverables in the process, which will be graded individually.

# Deliverables

You need to deliver following parts via Moodle:

:::{.incremental}
- __Initial thesis proposal__ (details see [template](assets/AW_Proposal_Template.docx)),
- __Pitch of your initial proposal__ (mandatory, but ungraded; 8 minutes presentation),
- __Research in-progress (RIP) paper__ (revision and extension of the initial proposal; details see [template](assets/AW_RIP-Paper_Template.docx)),
- Reflection of the __lessons learned__ (details see [template](assets/AW_Lessons-Learned_Template.docx)).
:::

. . .

For deadlines, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

The deliverables are graded individually and determine the grade with the following weights:

:::{.incremental}
- 30% __inital proposal__,
- 50% __research in-progress (RIP) paper__, and
- 20% __lessons learned__
:::

. . .

__Note:__ Compliance with formal requirements (see templates) and good scientific practice are critical pass criteria for all parts, means that in case of non-compliance the exam is automatically failed (e.g., plagiarism, even light forms).

## Research-in-progress-paper {.scrollable}

::: incremental

A summary of lessons learned that fulfills expectations has the following characteristics

::: incremental
- The learning progress is thoroughly reflected (i.e., the challenges, feedback, tools)
- The lessons learned are plausible
:::

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum.

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` — very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` — good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a “good performance”.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an “average   performance”*                                                                                             |
| `3` — satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` — sufficient             | [A   performance that “still adequately satisfies” the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` — not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}
