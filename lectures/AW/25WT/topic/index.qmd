# Motivation

> [I believe that the choice of research problem---choosing the phenomena we wish to explain or predict---is the 
> most important decision we make as a researcher.]{.link-color} We can learn research method. Albeit with greater 
> difficulty, we can also learn theory-building skills. With some tutoring and experience, we can also learn to carve out large numbers of problems that we might research. Unfortunately, teasing out deep, substantive research problems is another matter. It remains a dark art. *@weber2003problem*

# Introduction {.headline-only}

## What is research?

@weber2003problem characterizes doing research in terms of three activities:

::: incremental
1)  Describing some **phenomena** that we perceive in the world
2)  articulating a **theory** to account for the phenomena; and
3)  **testing** how well the theory accounts for the phenomena.
:::

. . .

In this course, we will not focus on the skills required for good research design or theory-building, rather we focus on communicating the results of research, that is **telling a relevant story**.

. . .

The relevance of your story is dependent on the phenomena that wish to explain or predict.

. . .

Thus, we start with discussing what a good topic is and outline some criteria and tools that may help you to find and chose a phenomena that creates momentum and is worth to devote your scarce resources.

# Effective research topics {.headline-only}

## Focus areas

To find an effective topic you need to identify [@recker2021scientific, p. 36]

::: incremental
1.  a **specific domain** with an
2.  **important phenomenon** that deserves attention from academia and that relates to a
3.  **problem with the existing knowledge** about this type of phenomenon.
    :::

## Exercise {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .discussion-slide}

Have a look at the first four pages of the [MISQ editorial](assets/MISQ-Editorial_2003_ProblemOfTheProblem.pdf) of @weber2003problem.

:::medium
What do you learn about the challenge of choosing a topic for your research?
:::

::: notes
Take approx. 20 minutes for that task.
:::

## Criteria for effective topics

::: notes
@colquitt2011publishing put forth five distinct criteria for effective topics in information systems (IS) and management science:
:::

::: large
[Significance,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [novelty,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [curiosity,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [scope,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} [and actionability]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

## Significance

**Taking on "grand challenges"**

::: incremental
-   Identify and confront or contribute to a grand challenge[^1]
-   Tackle such problems in a particular area if inquiry (i.e., slicing the elephant)
-   Try to make a contribution that is useful in theory and that will benefit individuals and society
-   Try a new approach that is different from the usual explanations
-   Articulate clearly how the study **solves a piece of a larger puzzle**
:::

[^1]: The grand challenges are large, important unsolved problem. Current grand challenges might be reflected by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to eradicate global poverty, disease, and hunger.

. . .

*Example:*

@ferlie2005nonspread took on a grand challenge in asking why evidence-based innovations failed to spread 
in the health care industry

:::notes
- They addressed why beneficial innovations fail to spread across organizations despite proven effectiveness
- They examined healthcare innovations in the UK NHS, specifically how professional groups mediate adoption decisions
- Their research extended innovation theory by highlighting professional mediation while providing practical insights 
  for healthcare implementation strategies
- They shifted from traditional organizational/environmental factors to focus on professional identity, knowledge 
  bases, and power dynamics as innovation filters
- Their research explains the "nonspread" phenomenon by showing how professional groups actively interpret, modify, or 
  resist innovations rather than passively adopting them
:::

## Discussion {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .discussion-slide}

::: large
What challenges are\
you interested in?
:::

In which area if inquiry could (your) research contribute to it?

## Novelty

**Changing the conversation**

::: incremental
-   Consider if and how your study might change the conversation that is already taking place in a given literature[^2]
-   Aim at either adding momentum to a conversation or giving it a new direction
-   Think of how you can generate new and creative solutions by exploring new domains and not to prefer the familiar, the mature and perspectives that are near to existing approaches (i.e., avoid the familiarity, maturity, and nearness traps)
:::

[^2]: Adding to a conversation requires to know the conversation. Research topics (and research questions), thus, do not come out of the air, you need to read a lot.

. . .

*Example:*

@agarwal2004knowledge focused on a new, under researched area by investigating how knowledge capabilities 
of industry incumbents affected the generation, development, and performance of "spin-outs"

:::: notes

- They shifted knowledge transfer literature from focusing on alliances/partnerships to employee mobility and 
  spin-outs as knowledge transfer vehicles
- They introduced "knowledge inheritance" concept, connecting entrepreneurship with knowledge management in novel ways 
  rather than just adding to existing approaches
- They studied understudied spin-out phenomenon instead of well-established knowledge transfer mechanisms like 
  licensing or joint ventures; examined dynamic venture creation processes rather than stable, mature knowledge 
  transfer relationships; and combined entrepreneurship, organizational learning, and strategy domains; used 
  longitudinal survival analysis instead of typical cross-sectional methods
- They reconceptualized spin-outs as both knowledge transfer mechanisms AND performance outcomes, revealing 
  bidirectional knowledge flows


::: callout-note
#### Common traps when finding a topic

Familiarity and nearness trap

:   Picking a topic that is too familiar and/or too close to the existing literature and, thus, might may only offer contributions that are not sufficiently different from existing perspectives.

Maturity trap

:   Selecting a topic that is too mature and, thus, might only offer redundant contributions.
:::
::::

## Discussion {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .discussion-slide}

::: large
What is required to\
identify a novel topic?
:::

What can you do to identify a topic that is not too mature and or too close to existing literature?

:::notes
- Look for emerging phenomena: Study new technologies, business models, or social trends before they become 
mainstream research topics
- Examine established concepts in new contexts: Apply mature theories to novel settings (e.g., digital platforms, 
  remote work, sustainability transitions)
- Focus on paradoxes and anomalies: Investigate cases where established theories fail to explain observed phenomena
- Read widely across disciplines: Subscribe to journals outside your field, attend interdisciplinary conferences
- Follow practitioner conversations: Monitor industry publications, social media, and professional forums for 
  emerging issues
- Look for "white spaces": Map existing literature to identify unexplored intersections between established research 
  streams
- Question assumptions: Challenge foundational premises in your field - what's taken for granted that might not be?
- Study failures and negative cases: Examine when established practices don't work or when expected outcomes don't 
  materialize
:::

## Curiosity

**Catching and holding attention**

::: incremental
-   Topics are interesting when their propositions counter a reader's taken-for-granted assumptions (e.g., showing a seemingly good phenomenon to be bad)
-   Try to identify and use surprising findings that cannot be explained by methodological issues or existing explanations (i.e., "breakdowns" that signal the potential existence of a mystery such as inconsistent findings)[^3]
-   Try to reframe, reformulate or solve the "mystery"
:::

[^3]: According to @colquitt2011publishing such topics arouse more interest than the more typical "gap-spotting" approach to generating research questions

. . .

*Example:*

@van2009searing strived to solve the mystery of contradictory findings about the effects of leader 
displays of emotion. They studied whether team performance would be facilitated by leaders displaying happiness or by leaders displaying anger.*

## Discussion {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .discussion-slide}

::: large
What are "mysteries" you have identified in your literature work?
:::

## Scope

**Casting a wider net** (not easily applicable for your master thesis)

::: incremental
-   Even the best topic ideas can be undermined if the resulting study is too small
-   Studies cannot tackle grand challenges if they are not ambitious in scope
-   Aim to fully and comprehensively sample the landscape in a given domain (i.e., relevant constructs, mechanisms, and perspectives)
-   You may may even include constructs and mechanisms derived by using multiple lenses
:::

. . .

*Example:* 

@seibert2001social examine the effect of social capital on career success. They include all three 
theoretical perspectives on social capital that can explain why and how the characteristics of a personal social network can impact career success*

## Actionability

**Offer insights for managerial or organizational practice**

@mcgahan2007academic outline five major ways that management studies can be actionable:

::: incremental
-   Offering counter-intuitive insights
-   Highlighting the effect of new and important practices
-   Showing inconsistencies in and consequences of practices
-   Suggesting a specific theory to explain an interesting and current situation
-   Identifying an iconic phenomenon that opens new areas of inquiry and practice
:::

## Discussion {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .discussion-slide}

::: large
What insights for practice do you expect from your study?
:::

## Conclusion

An effective topic ...

::: incremental
-   allows researchers to tackle a **grand challenge** in a literature,
-   pursue a **novel direction** that arouses,
-   maintains **curiosity**,
-   builds a study with **ambitious scope**, and
-   uncovers **actionable insights**.
:::

# Research question {.headline-only}

## Importance

Once you have identified a *problem domain* with an *important phenomenon* that deserves attention and relates to an *problem with existing knowledge* (i.e., an effective topic), you need to formulate and develop your own **research questions** and propose a plan to address them.

. . .

This challenge is much more difficult than learning methods and theories, largely because it is not as structured but is undefined and highly contextual [@recker2021scientific].

. . .

However, the research question(s) is/are the **fundamental cornerstone** that around which your whole research project revolves and evolves.

## Indications of bad research questions

@recker2021scientific outlines for main problems indicating that research questions should be revised:

::: html-hidden
:::large
[The "monologuing" problem, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[the "so what" problem, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[the "solving the world" problem, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and the "multitude" problem.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

::: notes
-   **The "monologuing" problem**: you cannot tell what research question your are tackling unless you engage in a five-minute monologue---you have not grasped the essence of the problem yet.
-   **The "so what" problem**: You cannot tell why answering the research question matters to anyone.
-   **The "solving the world" problem**: Your question has value, but cannot be answered given your resource constraints.
-   **The "multitude" problem**: You ask (too) many questions instead of one.

Further categories of inappropriate research questions are [@recker2021scientific]:

-   Obvious questions: "Are there challenges in using information technology?" Of course there are. Obvious questions have answers to which everyone would agree.
-   Irrelevant questions: "What is the influence of weather on the salaries of technology professionals?" There is no reason to believe that there is any influence whatsoever.
-   Absurd questions: "Is the earth flat after all?" Absurd questions have answers to which everyone would agree, although I read that almost two percent of people still believe the earth is flat.
-   Definitional questions: "Is technology conflict characterised by disagreement?" The answer is simply a matter of creating a concept that says it does. A definition is a form of description, not research.
-   Affirmation questions: "Can a decision-support tool be developed to facilitate decision-making for senior retail executives?" Yes.
:::

## Good research questions

A good research question should be:

::: incremental
-   **Clear and focused**: the question should clearly state what you need to do.
-   **Not too broad and not too narrow**: it must be possible to answer the question within the constraints of your research.
-   **Not too easy to answer**: the answers should not be obvious or affirmative.
-   **Researchable**: you must have access to data required to answer the question.
-   **Analytical rather than descriptive** the question should allow you to produce an analysis of the problem rather than a simple description of it.
:::

. . .

Once you have identified an important phenomenon, you need to **engage with literature** to identify problems with the existing knowledge. This helps you to narrow down your topic and create a good research question.

::: notes
Research questions are typically one of two types based on the issues they address [@recker2021scientific]:

1.  “What,” “who,” and “where” questions tend to focus on issues we seek to explore or describe because little knowledge exists about them.
2.  “How” and “why” questions are explanatory as they seek to answer questions about the causal mechanisms that are at work in a particular phenomenon.
:::

## Guiding questions

@recker2021scientific [p. 35-36] proposes a number of guiding questions can help you find a good research question, e.g.:

::: incremental
-   Do you know in which field of research your research questions reside?
-   Do you have a firm understanding of the body of knowledge in the field?
-   What are important open research questions or unsolved problems in the field that scientists agree on?
-   What areas need further exploration?
-   Could your study fill an important gap in knowledge?
-   Has your proposed study been done before? If so, is there room for improvement or expansion?
-   Is the timing right for the question to be answered?
-   Who would care about obtaining an answer to the question?

:::: html-hidden
::: notes
What are consumer- and product-related antecedents to differences in the valuation of human- vs. algorithm-created digital products? [@rix2025algorithm]

- **Significance:** Very high — taps into AI/consumer behavior, timely for digital markets.
- **Novelty:** Yes — “algorithm discount” is an emerging phenomenon; adds new conceptual ground.
- **Curiosity:** Clear puzzle (why do consumers devalue algorithmic output?).
- **Scope:** Ambitious but focused — restricted to antecedents, not all possible outcomes.
- **Actionability:** Strong — firms can adjust design/marketing strategies.
- **Clarity:** Excellent — concise, no ambiguity.
- **Answerability:** Yes — lends itself to experiments/surveys.
- **Analytical focus:** Clear independent (consumer/product antecedents) and dependent (valuation differences) variables.

Whether and how do conversational style and reciprocation triggers influence user information disclosure? [@adam2024web]

- **Significance:** High — relates to privacy, chatbot/UX design.
- **Novelty:** Yes — adds nuance (stylistic & social triggers) beyond generic "chatbot vs. form."
- **Curiosity:** Medium–high — "whether and how" signals uncertainty and depth.
- **Scope:** Appropriately narrow — 
  focuses on two levers affecting one key outcome.
- **Actionability:** Clear — design implications for conversational agents.
- **Clarity:** Minor flaw: "Whether and how" could be split into two clearer sub-RQs.
- **Answerability:** Yes — testable in lab/field experiments.
- **Analytical focus:** Strong — well-specified factors and outcome.

How do daily congruence and incongruence in the team-enacted versus individually needed use of agile practices 
affect developer well-being? [@benlian2025team]

- **Significance:** High — agile use/misalignment is a core IS management issue.
- **Novelty:** Yes — fine-grained "daily congruence" adds new perspective.
- **Curiosity:** High — counterintuitive potential (incongruence may harm/help).
- **Scope:** Nicely bounded — one outcome (well-being), one context (agile).
- **Actionability:** Very strong — managers can adapt agile routines.
- **Clarity:** Long sentence but precise; terms are operationalizable.
- **Answerability:** Yes — daily diary studies or panel data possible.
- **Analytical focus:** Excellent — congruence/incongruence as predictor, well-being as outcome.

How does the introduction of a substitutive decision-making AI system affect employees' professional role identity? And how do employees adapt their professional role identity in response to these AI systems? [@strich2021world]

- **Significance:** Very high — addresses identity threats in the future of work.
- **Novelty:** Strong — few studies directly link AI substitution with identity adaptation.
- **Curiosity:** Very strong — open question with human and organizational stakes.
- **Scope:** Appropriately bounded to identity, not all socio-technical effects.
- **Actionability:** Medium — insights more conceptual/theoretical than prescriptive.
- **Clarity:** Excellent — two tightly worded sub-RQs.
- **Answerability:** Qualitative/longitudinal research feasible.
- **Analytical focus:** Good — causal mechanisms implied (AI introduction → identity shifts/adaptation).

How can IT support be provided for reducing the problem-solving complexity of monitoring the structural and dynamic complexity of IT architectures in the context of a digital business strategy? [@widjaja2020monitoring]

- **Significance:** High — enterprise architecture complexity is a major IS challenge.
- **Novelty:** Moderate–high — adds a DSR angle to monitoring complexity.
- **Curiosity:** Solid — "reducing problem-solving complexity" is compelling.
- **Scope:** Quite broad — multiple forms of complexity, strategic context.
- **Actionability:** Strong — artifact-oriented, prescriptive.
- **Clarity:** Weaker — long and abstract phrasing; could be split into clearer parts.
- **Answerability:** Yes — via artifact design + evaluation.
- **Analytical focus:** Weaker than others — less explicit on variables/mechanisms.

## Motivation of RQs

@recker2021scientific [p. 36 ff] proposes a systematic four-step approach for motivating research questions that ensures logical flow from broad context to specific inquiry.

- **Problem domain:** Cybersecurity threats increasingly target humans rather than technical systems, with AI-enabled 
social engineering attacks creating scalable, personalized threats that bypass traditional security measures and threaten organizational reputation and finances
- **Phenomenon:** Social engineering represents a distinct socio-technical attack vector that exploits human 
  psychology through social interaction, relying on trust, deception, and influence rather than technical system vulnerabilities
- **Instability:** Current SE understanding suffers from definitional fragmentation (50 unique definitions) and 
  explanatory contradictions, with dual-process theories providing conflicting evidence about whether peripheral or central processing creates vulnerability
- **Research questions:** We pose two RQs, the first addresses definitional instability ("What defines social 
  engineering?"), the second aims at resolving explanatory contradictions ("How does social engineering unfold?") by systematically synthesizing mechanisms across psychological and contextual conditions
:::
::::

::: notes

First, establish a **problem domain statement** that highlights an important business or organizational context, emphasizing the scale and significance of the domain while including quantifiable evidence when possible, such as dollar amounts invested or lost, percentages of organizations affected, or market size metrics.

Second, identify a **specific phenomenon** by narrowing down from the broad domain to a particular issue or challenge, focusing on what makes this phenomenon especially important or problematic within the larger context.

Third, articulate the **knowledge gap or problem** by clearly stating what is wrong with current knowledge—this could be a gap where we don't know enough about a topic, inconsistencies where studies show conflicting results, outdated assumptions where current theories rest on unrealistic premises, or limited scope where existing research only covers part of the phenomenon.

Finally, formulate the **research question** as a logical conclusion flowing from the previous three steps, ensuring it directly addresses the identified knowledge problem and is positioned to fill the gap or resolve the inconsistency identified in the literature.

:::

### Example #1 (current project) {visibility="hidden"}

[**Problem domain statement**]{.h4}

Cybersecurity threats represent a critical organizational challenge, with digital system 
dependence creating vulnerabilities that extend beyond technical safeguards to human-centered attacks. While organizations invest heavily in technical cybersecurity measures, attackers increasingly bypass these defenses by targeting the "easier to breach" human element through social engineering (SE) attacks. These attacks manipulate human psychology to gain unauthorized access, extract sensitive data, or trigger harmful actions, threatening both organizational reputation and financial standing. The urgency has intensified with AI advances enabling highly scalable, personalized, and convincing attacks such as automated phishing, deepfake-based impersonation, and adaptive social manipulation.

[**Specific phenomenon**]{.h4}

Social engineering attacks represent a distinct socio-technical phenomenon where attackers 
exploit human vulnerabilities through social interaction rather than technical system breaches. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that target technological weaknesses, SE attacks rely on trust, deception, and psychological influence within the human element of security systems. These attacks manipulate decision-making processes to achieve unauthorized outcomes while disguising the attacker's true intent.

[**Knowledge gap/problem**]{.h4}

Current understanding of social engineering suffers from both definitional fragmentation 
and explanatory inconsistency. The literature reveals two critical problems: 

- With 50 unique definitions identified, SE remains conceptually fragmented, creating boundary problems and 
  limiting cumulative theorizing about this phenomenon.
- Existing theories, primarily dual-process models (ELM, HSM), provide conflicting evidence about SE mechanisms.  
  Some studies emphasize peripheral processing vulnerability, while others demonstrate central-route processing can 
  also be exploited, suggesting the binary "safe central/unsafe peripheral" distinction oversimplifies SE dynamics.

[**Research questions**]{.h4}

- RQ1: What defines social engineering? - Addresses the definitional fragmentation limiting theoretical development.
- RQ2: How does social engineering unfold? - Resolves the explanatory contradictions by systematically synthesizing 
  SE mechanisms across psychological, cognitive, affective, and contextual conditions.

*This approach moves from the broad cybersecurity domain to the specific SE phenomenon, identifies clear knowledge 
problems (fragmentation and contradiction), and poses research questions that directly address these gaps.*

### Example #2 [@benlian2025team] {visibility="hidden"}

[**Problem domain statement**]{.h4}

Organizations increasingly adopt agile software development practices to improve project outcomes and developer productivity, with 71% of organizations now using agile practices in their software development lifecycle.

*This establishes an important problem domain involving significant organizational investment in agile methodologies. The quantifiable aspect (71% adoption rate) demonstrates the widespread business relevance and financial implications of agile practices implementation.*

[**Specific phenomenon**]{.h4}

Despite this widespread adoption, agile projects continue to suffer from alarmingly high failure rates (50-96%), often attributed to human-related challenges where developers experience imbalances between the team-enacted use of agile practices and their individual needs for such practices.

*This narrows down to the specific phenomenon of interest: the disconnect between how agile practices are implemented at the team level versus what individual developers actually need, leading to developer stress, reduced well-being, and project failures.*

[**Knowledge gap/problem**]{.h4}

The literature to date has implicitly assumed that developer needs are perfectly reflected in team-enacted agile practices, focusing primarily on the extent of agile practices use in teams while overlooking the critical dimension of individual developer needs and the potential for incongruence between team practices and personal requirements.

*This identifies the gap in existing knowledge - previous research has adopted a one-dimensional view of agile practices use, assuming perfect alignment between team implementation and individual needs, without considering how misalignment affects developer outcomes.*

[**Research questions**]{.h4}

How do daily congruence and incongruence in the team-enacted versus individually needed use of agile practices affect developer well-being? Additionally, how pronounced is the influence of this congruence and incongruence among frequent (versus infrequent) team feedback-seeking developers?

*This research question logically follows from the identified problem domain, specific phenomenon, and knowledge gap, addressing the need to understand the effects of (mis)alignment between team-level and individual-level agile practices use.*

### Example #3 [@strich2021world] {visibility="hidden"}

[**Problem domain statement**]{.h4}

Organizations are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence systems in the workplace to enhance efficiency and competitiveness, with AI systems becoming capable of autonomously performing complex decision-making tasks that were previously the exclusive domain of skilled professionals.

*This establishes an important problem domain involving significant organizational investment in AI technologies. The business relevance is demonstrated by the widespread adoption across industries and the substantial impact on human work processes and organizational structures.*

[**Specific phenomenon**]{.h4}

However, when AI systems substitute for employees' core professional activities—particularly decision-making responsibilities—employees must relinquish defining aspects of their work without the ability to interact with or influence the AI system, creating fundamental challenges to how they perceive themselves professionally.

*This narrows down to the specific phenomenon of interest: the disconnect between employees' professional identity and their actual work when AI systems take over their core responsibilities, particularly focusing on substitutive decision-making AI that eliminates human interaction possibilities.*

[**Knowledge gap/problem**]{.h4}

The literature to date has primarily focused on how employees interact with and adapt to new information systems, assuming that users can engage with, influence, or overrule technological decisions. However, little is known about how substitutive decision-making AI systems—which eliminate employees' ability to interact with the technology—affect employees' professional role identity and the mechanisms they develop to cope with this unprecedented challenge.

*This identifies the gap in existing knowledge - previous research assumed human-technology interaction was possible, but substitutive AI systems represent a new class of technology that removes this interaction capability, creating unknown effects on professional identity.*

[**Research questions**]{.h4}

How does the introduction of a substitutive decision-making AI system affect employees' professional role identity? And how do employees adapt their professional role identity in response to these AI systems?

*This research question logically follows from the identified problem domain, specific phenomenon, and knowledge gap, addressing the need to understand both the effects of and responses to AI systems that fundamentally alter professional work without allowing human interaction or influence.*
