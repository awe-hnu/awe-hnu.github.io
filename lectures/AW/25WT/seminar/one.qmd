# Structure {.headline-only}

## The 5-paragraph formula

Every introduction needs:

:::incremental
1. **Hook** - Why this topic matters now
2. **Background** - What we know from literature
3. **Tension** - What's missing or unresolved
4. **Resolution** - Your approach to address it
5. **Contribution** - Expected value of your work
:::

:::fragment
**Key principle:** Each element gets its own paragraph(s)
:::

## Example #1

*When and Why Small Language Models Outperform Large Language Models in Resource-Constrained Environments and Domain-Specific Applications (Muhammad Khan)*

Well-structured introduction with **clear paragraphs**, not lengthy, one clear purpose:

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraph 1 (Hook)
: "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4... However, these achievements come with substantial computational demands... accessibility and practical deployment of LLMs remain restricted..." [but: no sources for the claims made]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 (Background)
: "Recent developments in small language models (SLMs) have emerged... Wang et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive survey showing that SLMs offer significant advantages..." [but: superficial synthesis of research, only 2 references]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 3 (Tension)
: "Despite these advancements, these platforms often lack sufficient physical realism..." [but: claims grounded in literature — no references at all]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4 (Resolution)
: "This thesis aims to address this research gap by investigating when and why SLMs ..." [but: RQ missing, method is not getting clear (reference to similar studies?)]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 5 (Contribution)
: "The expected contributions of this research include..." [but: contributions fuzzy/superficial, no reference to the BoK]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::

## Example #2

*Declarative Decentralized Analytics Framework for FAIR Data Utilization (Sabina Adhikari)*

Structure **follows the 5-paragraph formula**:

:::small
:::fragment
Paragraph 1 (Hook)
: "Over the last several years, data are being generated at an exponential rate... This data holds vast potential... As most information cannot be easily shared... privacy concerns... GDPR... significantly limits cross-institutional data use" [but: first half lacks citations; what exactly is the problem ("the lack of methodology ...")]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 (Background)
: "In order to solve these challenges, researchers have tried to develop frameworks... DAMS... Personal Health Train... However, most of the existing architectures today are of procedural nature..." [but: lists examples (methods/frameworks) rather than synthesizing the BoK; ends with a tension]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 3 (Tension)
: "Despite these huge technical innovations ... they lack standardized abstractions... central orchestration points contradict the core idea of decentralization" [but: how do poor reproducibility and central orchestration relate to the problem as well as to DAMs und PHTs?]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4 (Resolution)
: "This paper proposes to overcome the above limitations by developing a conceptual framework... design science and conceptual analysis... based on existing metadata standards like DAMS" [but: no explicit research question; link to the problem; method could be clearer (DSR?)]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 5 (Contribution)
: "This research shows how declarative design principles can simplify... It tends to create contribution to the academic discussion... bridges the connection between AI-driven analytics and distributed data management" [but: contributions need to be more specific/concrete]{.fragment .link-color}
:::
:::

## Example #3

*Simulation Scenario Generation based on OpenStreetMap Data (Niharika Patil)*

Paragraphs blur together, problem statement scattered throughout:

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraph 1 (Hook)
: "Autonomous vehicles today continue to be an area... the methods used to test them... remain largely manual... Hence, the need for automatic generation..." [establishes practical relevance, but already states RQ; does not explain concepts like SUMO, carla]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 (Background)
: "The recent development shows that OSM data has been utilized... several platforms—such as SUMO, CARLA, and CommonRoad—have successfully incorporated..." [no review of the BoK given]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 3 (Tension)
: "Despite these advancements, these platforms often lack sufficient physical realism... BeamNG as a high-fidelity, physics-based simulation..." [identifies some gap, but claims are not backed by literature, reads rather like the hook]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4 (Resolution)
: "The phenomenon this thesis examines is the feasibility... The idea is to replace or remove the current manual process... creating a pipeline developed in python..." [restates problem and background literatur; method is not clear]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 5 (Contribution)
: "The contributions made by this research will be both practical and theoretical..." [attempts to state contribution, but vague, non-committal, no grounding in BoK]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::


## Example #4

*Predictive Beamforming (Fatih Hazir)*

**No clear paragraph structure** — duplicate content, overlapping purposes, unclear flow:

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraph 1
: "Radar systems play a critical role... Air Traffic Control (ATC) radars... Eurocontrol regularly sets standards... Despite advances in radar signal processing, predictive beamforming remains a challenging task... Existing approaches often fail..." [Hook elements, but also problem statement mixed in one long paragraph]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 & 3 (Background)
: "Several previous studies have proposed machine learning–based classification methods... Some approaches utilize handcrafted feature extraction..." [no synthesis of literature, only two sources]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4
: "Despite advances in radar signal processing, predictive beamforming remains a challenging task..." [Same text as paragraph 2; copy-paste error; lack of careful editing]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4 (Resolution)
: "The proposed reinforcement learning–based predictive beamforming model will be evaluated using real ATC radar data..." [No goal, no RQ, method not clear]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 5 (Contribution)
: "The expected contribution of this thesis is a robust AI-driven predictive beamforming framework..." [Attempts contribution, but unspecific as not related to the BoK; still describing method/evaluation]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::

## Example #5

*Automated production planning with the help of artificial intelligence (Maximilian Franz)*

No visual paragraph structure — entire text runs together (use template), zero references:

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraph 1
: "The increasing complexity of production processes... production planning is currently carried out mainly using traditional IT systems such as SAP ERP... Although this method has proven itself in practice, it does have structural weaknesses... To compensate for these shortcomings, experienced production planners rely on heuristics... " [No clear paragraph break, combines hook, background, and problem into one dense block; zero references]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 (Tension)
: "Even advanced planning and scheduling (APS) systems are often still model-driven... There is a clear research gap between the theoretical performance of modern AI methods and their practical applicability..." [Again, no references to support claims about *clear* research gap]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 3 and 4 (Resolution)
: "This work addresses precisely this gap... The central research question is: How can an AI-supported prototype for production planning take bottlenecks..." [RQ stated, but no connection to the literature — what do we not know to built such a prototype?]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 5 (Contribution)
: "Significant scientific and practical benefits are expected if the thesis shows how data-driven decision-making mechanisms can extend classic planning logics..." [Vague, conditional contribution — not grounded in BoK]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 6 (Outline)
: "Structured in eight chapters, the master's thesis covers everything from..." [Too extensive; partly contradicts prior statements (e.g., DSR vs. research model)]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::

## Takeaways

:::{.fragment .medium}
Always use an outline first. 
:::

:::{.fragment .medium}
Have one clear message per paragraph.
:::

:::{.fragment .medium}
Connect the paragraph logically.

# Literature integration {.headline-only}

## Example #1

*Understanding the Success Dynamics of Digital Servitization: A Conceptual Synthesis through the RBV and DCV Lenses (Rabia Zehra Karataş)*

Sources well weaved into the narrative:

> Servitization generally describes a company's shift from a product focused approach to a service-focused approach in its business model (Kowalkowski et al.,
> 2017; Raddats et al., 2019). It offers a structure that can provide mutual benefits for both
> the manufacturer and the customer. It offers sustainable revenue streams and differentiation
> for the manufacturer, and it also creates the opportunity for comprehensive solutions and
> high satisfaction for the customer (Raddats et al., 2019). Information technologies play a
> critical role in this. Digital technologies such as advanced sensors, big data, and the Internet
> of Things (IoT) are impacting the relationships manufacturers establish with their
> customers and the way they do business (Kamp & Parry, 2017).

## Example #2

*Simulation Scenario Generation based on OpenStreetMap Data (Niharika Patil)*

Citation dump — the studies seem to be randomly selected (plus acronyms are not explained):

> For example, several platforms—such as SUMO, CARLA, and CommonRoad—have successfully incorporated OSM-based workflows... **Zilske et al. (2011)** showed how OSM data could be automatically transformed... Similarly, **Maierhofer et al. (2021)** expanded this method...

## Further examples
:::fragment
*Declarative Decentralized Analytics Framework for FAIR Data Utilization (Sabina Adhikari)*

Factual claims **without any evidence**, e.g.:

> Over the last several years, data are being generated at an exponential rate from the various institutions such as healthcare, research institutes, and business organizations.
:::

:::fragment
*Multi-Model, Hardware Aware Neural Network Optimization for Edge Devices (Upanishadh Iyer)*

Bibliography given, but **no source is cited in the text.**
:::

## Other observations

:::fragment
To few references (the introduction already provides a synthesis of current research).
:::

:::fragment
Bibliographical data often not complete.
:::

:::fragment
Often pre-dominantly references from questionable sources (often pre-prints from Arxiv high quality outlets missing). Potential reasons:

- AI-driven research (no access to papers beyond the paywalls)
- Topic does not relate to (current) conversations in academia
:::

## Takeaways

:::fragment
Your sources are the product of **thorough literary research.**
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Weave these into your narrative — build an argument supported by studies.
:::
:::

:::fragment
The citation supports the claim but doesn't interrupt the flow.
:::

:::fragment
Tell a story that happens to be supported by research.
:::

:::fragment
Every factual claim needs support. "Common knowledge" is rarer than you think.
:::

:::fragment
Use a citation manager, check if bibliographical data is complete.

# Research question clarity {.headline-only}

## Good research questions

As discussed in class, a good research question should be: 

:::incremental
- **Explicit** - it must be clearly stated
- **Clear and focused** - the question should clearly state what you need to do
- **Motivated** - it is totally clear why you are asking it (aligned with the hook and gap)
- **Not too easy to answer** - easy to locate in the text
- **Researchable** - you must have access to data required to answer the question.
:::

## Example #1

*Automated production planning with the help of artificial intelligence (Maximilian Franz)*

> How can an AI-supported prototype for production planning take bottlenecks (such as personnel, capacities, and setup times) into account and thus automatically and soundly replace the previous manual backward scheduling?

:::incremental
- **Explicit**: Clearly stated in one sentence
- **Clear and focused**: Specifies the artifact (AI-supported prototype; better: an AI system), the constraints (bottlenecks), and the outcome (replace manual scheduling)
- **Motivated**: Built up through the hook (complexity of production), why we cannot answer the question (i.e., it is not motivated by instabilities in the BoK)
- **Not too easy**: Requires design, implementation, and evaluation of a prototype
- **Researchable**: Access to Diehl Aviation data and ERP systems mentioned, but the question still seems to be too broad
:::

## Example 2

*Exploring Leadership Approaches to AI-Driven Cultural Transformation in Organizations (Oluwaseun Oke)*

> Which leadership approaches prove most effective in driving cultural transformation during AI adoption? How do leaders influence organizational culture in the face of AI-driven change? What critical success factors underpin leadership-driven AI cultural transformation? And how can organizations assess the effectiveness of their leadership approaches in this domain?

:::incremental
- **Explicit**: Clearly stated
- **Clear and focused**: Multiple questions risk scope creep; primary RQ not identified
- **Motivated**: Well-motivated by AI transformation challenges, but lacks focus (too broad; too many relationships)
- **Not too easy**: Requires multi-case study analysis
- **Researchable**: Method (Stake's framework) and data sources specified; theory missing
:::

## Example 3

*Definition of Cloud Sovereignty (Mihael Hristov)*

> How is cloud sovereignty defined?"

:::incremental
- **Explicit**: Very clear
- **Clear and focused**: Extremely focused
- **Motivated**: Motivation present (confusion in terminology)
- **Not too easy**: Too narrow
- **Researchable**: Highly researchable (maybe too researchable)
:::

:::fragment
Recommendation: have a look at @hund2021digital - they propose a definition and a theoretical framework
:::

## Example 4

*Simulation Scenario Generation based on OpenStreetMap Data (Niharika Patil)*

> "How practical is it to use BeamNG.drive to automatically create driving simulation scenarios from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data while preserving precise GPS-based positioning data for simulated vehicles?" 

:::incremental
- **Explicit**: Clear
- **Clear and focused**: Focused on specific tool and data source
- **Motivated**: Manual scenario creation is time-consuming; instability in BoK not clear
- **Not too easy**: "How practical is it" sounds like feasibility test, **not research question**
- **Researchable**: Tools are available
:::

# Overall clarity {.discussion-slide}

## Common issues

We observed following weaknesses regarding clarity:

:::incremental
- **Paragraph blending:** multiple ideas in one paragraph
- **Missing transitions:** paragraphs often don't connect
- **Vague language:** generic terms without specifics (concepts not introduced)
:::

## Paragraph blending

*Exploring Leadership Approaches to AI-Driven Cultural Transformation in Organizations (Oluwaseun Oke)*

One large paragraph covering at least 4 distinct ideas:

[What agentic AI is,]{.fragment} [where it's being used,]{.fragment} [ethical questions that arise,]{.fragment} [academic debates,]{.fragment} [responsibility issues,]{.fragment} [transparency needs,]{.fragment} [and value alignment.]{.fragment}

:::fragment
**Rule:** One paragraph, one main idea. This has at least 4 distinct ideas.
:::

:::fragment
:::smaller
Potential fix:

- **Paragraph 1:** What is agentic AI and where is it used (Hook)
- **Paragraph 2:** Ethical challenges from autonomy (Hook)
- **Paragraph 3:** Academic debates about accountability (Background)
- **Paragraph 4:** Specific research gaps (Background)
:::
:::

## Missing transitions

*Predictive Beamforming (Fatih Hazir)*

:::fragment
Paragraph ends:

> ... which makes it challenging to reproduce and extend such systems to new analytical tasks (Šimko et al., 2021).
:::

:::fragment
Next paragraph starts:

> Despite these huge technical innovations, the systems are not yet having the full features ...
:::

:::fragment
**Problem:** "Despite" suggests contrast, but the previous paragraph was *also* about limitations. These should be in the same paragraph OR need a clearer transition.
:::


## Vague language

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .fragment}
**Vague** (Maximilian Franz):

> The increasing complexity of production processes in industry poses major challenges for companies when it comes to planning and controlling their manufacturing operations.

*Generic terms: challenges, complexity*
:::

::: {.column .fragment}
**Specific** (Alekseeva-Aryuna):

> Accurate credit risk assessment is fundamental to modern banking, playing a crucial role in regulatory compliance, financial stability, and informed decision-making. Central to this process is the calculation of expected credit losses (ECL)...

*Concrete terms: ECL, capital planning, provisioning*
:::
::::

:::fragment
**Be specific.** Avoid "challenges" or "issues" without saying *what* they are.
:::

# Language and style {.headline-only}

# Summary {.headline-only}

## Key takeaways

:::fragment
[Structure]{.h4}

- Follow the **5-paragraph formula:** Hook — Background — Tension — Resolution — Contribution
- One paragraph = one main idea
- Use transitions between paragraphs
:::

:::fragment
[Literature]{.h4}

- Take literature work seriously
- Weave citations into your narrative naturally
- Don't just list studies—synthesize them
- **Every factual claim** needs support
:::

----

:::fragment
[Research question]{.h4}

- State it explicitly as a question
- Set it up—explain **why** we need to ask it
:::

:::fragment
[Clarity]{.h4}

- Use **specific, concrete language**
- Avoid vague terms like "challenges" or "issues" without specifying
- Use the "reverse outline" test: Can you summarize each paragraph in one sentence?
:::

## Final advices

:::incremental
- **Literature is key:** gain a solid understanding of the literature. Read, read, read.
- **Structure is scaffolding:** use it until it becomes natural.
- **Make your RQ unmissable:** bold it, frame it, highlight it.
- **Claims need to be backed:** every factual claim has a citation.
- **Gaps need specificity:** more research needed says nothing.
- **Literature tells a story:** show evolution and debate.
- **Clarity beats complexity:** clear writing reflects clear thinking.
