# Structure {.headline-only}

## The 5-paragraph formula

Every introduction needs:

:::incremental
1. **Hook** - Why this topic matters now
2. **Background** - What we know from literature
3. **Tension** - What's missing or unresolved
4. **Resolution** - Your approach to address it
5. **Contribution** - Expected value of your work
:::

:::fragment
**Key principle:** Each element gets its own paragraph(s)
:::

## Example #1

*Artificial Intelligence for Adaptive Microscale Systems (Noha El Nagar)*

The structure is clear, but the **research question is missing** and the link to the literature is weak.

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraph 1 (Hook)
: "AI has become one of the defining technologies... Bringing AI capabilities to the microscale represents an emerging and largely unexplored research area." [But: focus on the relevance not the gap here]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 (Background)
: Systematic review of microrobotics and smart materials research
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 3 (Tension)
: "However, most existing microsystems remain limited in functionality because they depend on external control signals, lack local sensing and decision-making abilities, and cannot adapt to changes in the complex environment." [But: gap is not covered by literature]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4 - 6 (Resolution)
: "Artificial intelligence offers the theoretical and computational foundation to overcome these challenges... This thesis focuses on designing adaptive microscale systems..." [But: RQ is missing]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 7 (Contribution)
: "The expected contribution of this research is twofold. First,... an area that has so far received little attention ... " [But the contributions are not related to literature]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::

## Example #2

*Building a Pro-democratic AI Influencer (Tobias Gebhardt)*

Interesting topic, but **structural disorder** (resolution before tension)

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraph 1 (Hook)
: "It is more important than ever to understand how AI systems influence civic behavior... Cambridge Analytica... concern of many scholars that AI is a threat to democracy..." [strong hook]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 (Background)
: "AI can be used in the form of virtual or AI influencers... defined as digital characters... need to overcome certain barriers... often achieve high perceived credibility..." [decent synthesis]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 3 (Resolution) 
: "To combat the potential misuse... this thesis aims to mitigate the damage... This leads to the following research question Q1..." [The RQ and aim are presented *before* the research gap/tension is established]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4 (Tension) 
: "While prior research has examined AI influencers primarily in marketing contexts... there is a lack of connecting both fields... limits understanding of how a pro-democratic AI influencer..." [The gap should come before the RQ to justify it]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 5 (Resolution) 
: "Therefore, I am proposing Design Science Research... tested in a 2x2 study design... thesis is grounded in Source Credibility Theory..." [too lengthy for an introduction; contributions are not explicit]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::

## Example 3 {.scrollable}

*Driving Equitable Healthcare in Precision Oncology for Underrepresented Groups (Joy-Angel Adoboe)*

Although one can follow it despite deviations from the formula, **the 'real hook' kicks in late.**

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraph 1 (Hook)
: "In 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American woman was treated... her cervical cells were retrieved without her permission... Repetitive similar historical events contribute to hesitancy..." [the historical anecdote (1951) feels slightly disconnected from the modern AI focus; what is the problem?]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 2 (Background)
: "AI can be defined as... defined by Schwartzberg et al. (2017)..." [Core concepts introduced, but weak synthesis of the BoK]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 3 (Background & Tension)
: "As highlighted by Hulsen et al. (2019)... However, research by Landry et al. (2018), show that genomic databases... lack representative data... Bias can be defined 'as a systematic error' (Ferrara, 2024)..." [Opens with background; heavy reliance on a single source for multiple definitions and examples]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 4 (Hook)
: "The absence of significant data for some less represented groups can pose a challenge in deriving the most appropriate treatment which can lead to bias..." [Problematizes the practical problems with biases - motivates the research]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraphs 5 & 6 (Resolution)
: "Therefore, this research seeks to answer the question on how data and algorithmic bias can be mitigated... using quantitative methods... and secondary data..." [RQ is missing; experimental design claim contradicts secondary data use]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 7 (Contribution)
: "The findings of this study will help support healthcare institutions to make more precise decisions... and face less bias with AI tools..." [Purely practical contribution; lacks specific theoretical contribution to the BoK]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::

## Example #4

*Understanding Cognitive Load Across Work Models (Viktoria Kraus)*

**Structural deviation**, difficult to follow the thread

:::small

:::fragment
Paragraphs 1 & 2 (Hook)
: "Before the COVID-19 pandemic... share increased sharply... the central question of this thesis is: How do employees describe and experience cognitive load...?" [Problem is not yet clear, but RQ is stated already, breaking the tension-building arc]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 7
: "Teleworking has expanded rapidly... Research highlights that well-being outcomes depend on factors such as telework intensity... Cognitive load theory (CLT), a major contribution of John Sweller... addresses how instructional design can support learning..."
[Attempt to a synthesis (remote work); lengthy introduction of the theory without strong why; intersection between remote work and cognitive load remains somewhat unclear]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 8 (Tension)
: "Despite the growing prevalence... there remains a significant gap in understanding how employees themselves experience... Existing research has primarily focused on objective performance metrics..." [The gap is stated but the claim is not backed by references]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::fragment
Paragraph 10 (Contribution)
: "Through this approach, the thesis seeks to... contribute to the theoretical expansion of Cognitive Load Theory..." ["Theoretical expansion" is vague; does not specify *how* the theory will be expanded; not related to literature]{.fragment .link-color}
:::

:::

## Takeaways

:::{.fragment .medium}
Always use an outline first. 
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Have one clear message per paragraph.
:::

If a paragraph contains multiple "Additionally..." or "Moreover..." statements, it probably needs splitting.
:::

:::{.fragment .medium}
Connect the paragraph logically.
:::

# Research questions  {.headline-only}

## Good research questions

As discussed in class, a good research question should be:

:::incremental
- **Explicit** - it must be clearly stated
- **Clear and focused** - the question should clearly state what you need to do
- **Motivated** - it is totally clear why you are asking it (aligned with the hook and gap)
- **Not too easy to answer** - easy to locate in the text
- **Researchable** - you must have access to data required to answer the question.
:::

## Example #1

*Knowledge Distillation for Edge Deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Kakara Lalitha Sai Priya)*

> Specifically, the study will analyze configurations involving teacher-student layer mapping, temperature scaling, and loss function variations to evaluate their impact on model accuracy, latency, and energy consumption.

:::incremental
- **Explicit**: resarch question is missing ("only aims")
- **Clear and focused**: scope is very well defined: independent variables (mapping, temperature, loss function) vs. dependent variables (accuracy, latency, energy)
- **Motivated**: tension between LLM capabilities and edge device constraints (latency, energy) clearly motivates the study; but rather weak linkages to literature
- **Not too easy**: complex experimentation needed
- **Researchable**: Maybe not: one needs a dataset containing both the raw project data and the original human prediction
:::

## Example #2

*Can AI outperform humans in predicting project completion time in Agile software development (Eldar Gaifullin)*

> Can an LLM, trained on unstructured textual and historical project data, outperform a human PM in predicting software development delays?

:::incremental
- **Explicit**: clearly stated (along with a secondary question about parameters).
- **Clear and focused**: sets up a specific competitive analysis: LLM vs. Human PM.
- **Motivated**: estimates are historically inaccurate; maybe bc we are ignoring half the data; improving them has high business value (but is LLM the right tech?)
- **Not too easy**: comparing performance is complex.
- **Researchable**: maybe not: one needs a dataset containing both the raw project data and the original human prediction
:::

## Example #3

*Can Artificial Intelligence Truly Understand Human Emotions? A Study on Emotional Intelligence in Chatbots (Merrybell Babu)* 

> To what extent can artificial intelligence, particularly chatbots, understand and replicate human emotional intelligence?

:::incremental
- **Explicit**: clearly stated.
- **Clear and focused**: using the word "Understand"  in AI research is dangerous (philosophical debate); you cannot measure a machine's "understanding", only its "output".
- **Motivated**: the gap between simulated empathy and understanding is interesting, but ...
- **Not too easy**: answering if a machine "truly understands" is philosophically impossible (for you).
- **Researchable**: the method focuses on *user perception*, but the RQ asks about the machine's capability to understand.
:::

:::fragment
The RQ could be motivated by a gap in **user experience design** (and maybe its consequences), not machine consciousness.
:::

# Literature and gaps {.headline-only}

## From bibliography to narrative

:::medium
Don't just list - synthesize!
:::

**Weak:** "Smith (2020) found X. Jones (2021) found Y. Brown (2022) found Z."

**Strong:** "Early research established X (Smith 2020), which was extended to include Y (Jones 2021). However, recent work challenges these assumptions by showing Z (Brown 2022)."

## Example #1 {.scrollable}

*Generative AI and Organizational Privacy: Modeling Human Risk Factors in Data Leakage Incident (Syed Shah)*

Good synthesis and transition to the gap:

:::fragment
> Gupta et al. (2023) argue that generative AI models are a 'double-edged sword'... Byreddy (2024) reinforces this perspective... Feuerriegel et al. (2024) further highlight... Collectively, these studies suggest that...
:::

:::fragment
Then clearly states the gap:

> Despite growing scholarly attention, the phenomenon of human-driven data leakage through AI prompts remains insufficiently understood.
:::

:::fragment
And explains why it matters:

> This represents a critical gap... vital for developing effective prevention strategies...
:::


## Example #2

*Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Cyber Defense (Sudhandra Babu)*

Strong narrative arc:

> Early research concentrated on anomaly detection... Later work began applying RL to dynamic scenarios... In parallel, scholars demonstrated multi-agent reinforcement learning... These contributions collectively illustrate the shift from reactive to adaptive security

:::fragment
However, only a few studies were cited, so the link to the literature needs to be strengthened.
:::

:::fragment
**Note:** Uses temporal markers ("early," "later," "in parallel") to show evolution of ideas
:::

## Example #3

*The Impact of AI in Crowdsourcing Workforce (Jofel Diaz Ortega)*

Vague gap:

> The collateral effects which can emerge on crowd workers by this coming evolution have not been deeply studied.

:::incremental
- What effects specifically?
- Why does this matter?
- Who is affected?
:::

## Takeaways

:::fragment
Your sources are the product of **thorough literary research.**
:::

:::fragment
:::medium
Weave these into your narrative — build an argument supported by studies.
:::
:::

:::fragment
For every gap statement, make clear:

1. **What's missing?** Be specific about missing knowledge
2. **Why does it matter?** Real consequences
3. **Who cares?** Stakeholders affected
:::

# Language and clarity {.headline-only}

## Citation discipline

**Weak:**

> It is widely believed that AI causes bias

:::fragment
**Strong:**

> Research demonstrates that biased training data leads to discriminatory outputs (Kordzadeh & Ghasemaghaei, 2022)
:::

:::{.fragment .medium}
Every factual claim needs a citation
:::

## Vague vs. specific references

:::columns
:::column
**Weak:**

> Studies show that...

> Researchers have found...

> It has been argued...
:::

:::{.column .fragment}
**Strong:**

> Dietvorst et al. (2015) found that ...

> Recent meta-analysis reveals ... (Wang et al., 2024)

> Contrary to earlier assumptions, Liu (2023) demonstrates ...
:::
:::

## Academic confidence

**Too tentative:**

> It might be possible that perhaps organizations could potentially benefit...

:::fragment
**Too bold:**

> This research will definitively solve...
:::

:::fragment
**Appropriate:**

> This research aims to...
> Evidence suggests that...
> The findings are expected to contribute...
:::

## Other observations

:::incremental
1. Claims without citations (e.g., Laura Garcia Santos)
2. Overly long sentences (5+ lines; e.g., Smarika Rijal)
3. Undefined technical terms (multiple students)
4. Mixed terminology (use different terms for same concept; multiple students)
:::

:::{.fragment .medium}
Define terms on first use, maintain consistent terminology, cite all claims
:::

# Language and style {.headline-only}

# Summary {.headline-only}

## Key takeaways

:::fragment
[Structure]{.h4}

- Follow the **5-paragraph formula:** Hook — Background — Tension — Resolution — Contribution
- One paragraph = one main idea
- Use transitions between paragraphs
:::

:::fragment
[Literature]{.h4}

- Take literature work seriously
- Weave citations into your narrative naturally
- Don't just list studies—synthesize them
- **Every factual claim** needs support
:::

----

:::fragment
[Research question]{.h4}

- State it explicitly as a question
- Set it up—explain **why** we need to ask it
:::

:::fragment
[Clarity]{.h4}

- Use **specific, concrete language**
- Avoid vague terms like "challenges" or "issues" without specifying
- Define core concepts
- Use the "reverse outline" test: Can you summarize each paragraph in one sentence?
:::


## Final advices

:::incremental
- **Literature is key:** gain a solid understanding of the literature. Read, read, read.
- **Structure is scaffolding:** use it until it becomes natural.
- **Make your RQ unmissable:** bold it, frame it, highlight it.
- **Claims need to be backed:** every factual claim has a citation.
- **Gaps need specificity:** more research needed says nothing.
- **Literature tells a story:** show evolution and debate.
- **Clarity beats complexity:** clear writing reflects clear thinking.
