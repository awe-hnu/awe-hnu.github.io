# Task

:::medium
You need to apply what you have learned and prepare a convincing **introduction for your master's thesis**.
:::

You will go through key academic writing processes over the course of the semester, from finding a topic, writing a draft of the introduction to your master's thesis, gathering feedback, revising your introduction and reflecting on the process. You will complete several deliverables in the process. These will reflect your learning progress and will be graded individually.

# Deliverables

You need to deliver following parts via Moodle:

:::{.incremental}
- Initial **version of the introduction** to your master thesis (20 points; [template](assets/25WT_AW_Introduction_Template.docx))
- __Round-table discussion__ (bonus points)
- **Reflection and revision** of your introduction (70 points; [template](assets/25WT_AW_Reflection-and-Revision_Template.docx))
:::

. . .

For deadlines, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

The deliverables are graded individually and determine the grade with the following weights:

:::{.incremental}
- 20 points for the initial **version of the introduction**,
- 70 points for the **reflection and revision**
- Bonus points for you contributions in the **round-table discussions**[^bonus]
:::

. . .

**Note:** Compliance with formal requirements (see templates) and good scientific practice are critical pass criteria for all parts, means that in case of non-compliance the exam is automatically failed (e.g., plagiarism, even light forms).

[^bonus]: The bonus points are assigned based on your engagement in the discussions (particularly the quality of your feedback). These can improve your performance by up to one grade increments (up to .7).

- The potential contributions of the thesis are getting clear.
- The proposal tells a conclusive story.
- The thesis proposal is well aligned to the audience and testifies professionalism.

- The justification of improvements is comprehensible
- The tool usage is well documented and critically evaluated
- The introduction has improved significantly
- The learning progress is thoroughly reflected (i.e., meta-reflection)
:::

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum. 
:::

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` — very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` — good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a “good performance”.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an “average   performance”*                                                                                             |
| `3` — satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` — sufficient             | [A   performance that “still adequately satisfies” the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` — not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}
