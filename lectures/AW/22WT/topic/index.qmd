> I believe that the choice of research problem---choosing the phenomena we wish to explain or predict---is the most important decision we make as a researcher. We can learn research method. Albeit with greater difficulty, we can also learn theory-building skills. With some tutoring and experience, we can also learn to carve out large numbers of problems that we might research. Unfortunately, teasing out deep, substantive research problems is another matter. It remains a dark art. *@weber2003problem*

# Introduction

@weber2003problem characterizes doing research in terms of three activities:

::: incremental
1)  Describing some **phenomena** that we perceive in the world
2)  articulating a **theory** to account for the phenomena; and
3)  **testing** how well the theory accounts for the phenomena.
:::

. . .

In this course, we will not focus on the skills required for good research design or theory-building, rather we focus on __telling a relevant story__.

. . .

How relevant the story is, is defined in the __first phase of research__, which is about describing those phenomena that you perceive in the world that you wish to explain or predict.

:::{.notes}
We will discuss some criteria and tools that may help you to find and chose a phenomena that creates momentum and is worth to devote your scarce resources.

# Effective topics

What is the anatomy of a topic in information systems and management studies that creates momentum?

. . .

In an attempt to answer that question, @colquitt2011publishing put furth five distinct criteria for effective topics:

:::{.incremental}
- significance,
- novelty,
- curiosity,
- scope, and
- actionability
:::

##	Significance

__Taking on “grand challenges”__

:::{.incremental}
- Identify and confront or contribute to a “grand challenge”[^1]
- Tackle such problems in a particular literature or area if inquiry (i.e., slicing the elephant)
- Aim at a contribution that has theoretical usefulness and from which individual and societal benefit may accrue
- Take a bold and unconventional way that leaps beyond existing explanations (e.g., going behind conventional explanations)
- Articulate clearly how the study __solves a piece of a larger puzzle__ and how it moves the field
:::

. . .

*Example: @ferlie2005nonspread took on a grand challenge in asking why evidence-based innovations failed to spread in the health care industry*

[^1]:The grande challenges are large, important unsolved problem. Current grand challenges might be reflected by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to eradicate global poverty, disease, and hunger.

## Think about {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What "grand challenges" do you see?

In which area if inquiry could (your) research contribute to it?

## Novelty 

__Changing the conversation__

:::{.incremental}
- Consider whether your study changes the conversation that is already taking place in a given literature[^2]
- Aim at either adding momentum to a conversation or giving it a new direction
- Think of how you can generate new and creative solutions by exploring new domains and not to prefer the familiar, the mature and perspectives that are near to existing approaches (i.e., avoid the familiarity, maturity, and nearness traps)
:::

. . .

*Example: @agarwal2004knowledge focused on a new, under researched by investigating how knowledge capabilities of industry incumbents affected the generation, development, and performance of “spin-outs”*


:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
#### Familiarity, maturity, and nearness traps
Familiarity trap
: Picking a topic that is too familiar and, thus, might only offer marginal extension of an existing conversation. ("familiarity trap")

Maturity trap
: Selecting a topic that is too mature and, thus, might only offer redundant contributions.
 
Nearness trap
: Choosing a topic that is too close to the existing literature and, thus, may only offer contributions that are not sufficiently different from existing perspectives.
:::
:::

[^2]:Adding to a conversation requires to know the conversation. Research topics (and research questions), thus, do not come out of the air, you need to read a lot.

## Think about {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What strategies can you apply to identify a topic that that avoids the familiarity, maturity, and nearness traps?

## Curiosity

__Catching and holding attention__

:::{.incremental}
- Topics are interesting when their propositions counter a reader’s taken-for-granted assumptions (e.g., showing a seemingly good phenomenon to be bad)
- Try to identify and use surprising findings that cannot be explained by methodological issues or existing explanations (i.e., "breakdowns" that signal the potential existence of a mystery such as inconsistent findings)[^4]
- Try to reframe, reformulate or solve the "mystery"
:::

. . .

*Example: @van2009searing strived to solve the mistery of contradictory findings about the effects of leader displays of emotion. They studied whether team performance would be facilitated by leaders displaying happiness or by leaders displaying anger.*

[^4]: According to @colquitt2011publishing such topics arouse more interest than the more typical “gap-spotting” approach to generating research questions

## Think about {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What are "mysteries" you have identified in your literature work?

##	Scope

__Casting a wider net__

:::{.incremental}
- Even the best topic ideas can be undermined if the resulting study is too small
- Studies cannot tackle grand challenges if they are not ambitious in scope
- Aim to fully and comprehensively sample the landscape in a given domain (i.e., relevant constructs, mechanisms, and perspectives) 
- You may may even include constructs and mechanisms derived by using multiple lenses
:::

. . .

*Example: @seibert2001social examine the effect of social capital on career success. They include all three theoretical perspectives on social capital that can explain why and how the characteristics of a personal social network can impact career success*

## Think about {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What would be a relevant perspectives for your study?

## Actionability

__Offer insights for managerial or organizatoinal practice__

@mcgahan2007academic outline five major ways that management studies can be actionable:

:::{.incremental}
- Offering counter-intuitive insights
- Highlighting the effect of new and important practices
- Showing inconsistencies in and consequences of practices
- Suggesting a specific theory to explain an interesting and current situation
- Identifying an iconic phenomenon that opens new areas of inquiry and practice
:::

## Think about {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="images/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What insights for practice do you expect from your study?

## Conclusion

An effective topic ...

:::{.incremental}
- allows researchers to tackle a __grand challenge__ in a literature,
- pursue a __novel direction__ that arouses,
- maintains __curiosity__,
- builds a study with __ambitious scope__, and
- uncovers __actionable insights__.

# Research question

Once you have identified an probably effective overarching topic, your need to formulate and develop your own research questions and propose a plan to address them. 

. . .

This challenge is much more difficult than learning methods and theories, largely because it is not as structured but is undefined and highly contextual [@recker2021scientific].
