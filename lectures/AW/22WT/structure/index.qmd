# Motivation {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> When developing or revising the structure for your own paper, remember that a good option is always to follow as closely as possible the standard paper structure instead of inventing new structures. Innovative structures are not always well received in the academic community because the novel structure makes reading the paper more difficult. *@recker2021scientific [p. 178]*

# Opening exercise {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

Scan approx. ten papers you have read lately and try to derive what @recker2021scientific calls the standard paper structure.

If the structure of some paper derive from the "standard" consider why.

## Research types

Regarding you master thesis, there are basically two approaches you can take: *behavioral science* or *design science*. The structure proposed here fits to behavioral science research.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

#### Behavioral science

- Development of a research model or assumptions based on theoretical considerations of literature
- Empirical test of the research model
- Derivation of management recommendations

:::

::: {.column}
#### Design science

- Development of an artifact based on the body of knowledge (practice and theory)
- Empirical test of the artifact
- Refinement and repetition of the empirical test until the artifact is sufficient for management recommendation

# Structure

## Why structue matters

**Science is about new ideas in old formats.**

. . .

Reviewers and readers are accustomed to certain ways of reading an article—the so-called “script” [@grover2015new].

. . .

Innovative structures are not always well received by scholars because the novel structure makes the paper difficult to read.

. . .

An innovative structure **distracts from the content**, forces readers to focus more on the structure, which gives them less capacity to focus on the content [@recker2021scientific].

. . .

Thus, a good advice is to follow the script and make only mindful variations.

## Generic paper structure (empirical papers)

| Section                    | Content
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | 
| **Introduction**           | Problem statement, research gap, research question, approach, contributions
| **Background**             | Literature on the topic, research gap, general theory 
| **Theory**                 | Assumptions, propositions, hypotheses
| **Methodology**            | Sampling, data collection and analysis methods, etc.
| **Findings**               | Descriptive results of the data analysis
| **Discussion**             | Findings, theoretical and practical contributions, limitations, further research, conclusion
| **Conclusion**             | Closing frame

: Macro-structure [@tams2010effect] {#tbl-macro}


# Introduction

The main goal of the introduction is to capture the reader's curiosity (motivation) and set the right frame (specification, outline).


:::{.incremental}
- **Motivation**: What is your problem, and why is it a problem (requires a brief report of the state of the art)?
- **Specification**: What is your specific research question/research outcome (contribution)? What is your research approach (in *very general* terms)?
- **Outline**: How will the paper tell us about what you did?
:::

. . .

Good introductions are **short**[^short]

. . .

Place the study in the context of previous research but tell only what the reader needs to know to understand the present work.

[^short]: The rule of thumb is not more than 1.5 pages with 2.0 line spacing

## Hook vs. gap

**Motivate your research with a *hook*, not a *gap* [@grant2011publishing].**

. . .

The **gap** is usually the argument that something hasn't been done yet. Necessary, but not sufficient as some things shouldn't be done.

. . .

The **hook** is a strategy to find a problem that someone cares about. 

::: {.incremental}
- Resolving a contradiction in the literature
- Expanding the literature to include specific, important phenomena/understandings/contexts (and why)
- Resolving a puzzle for practitioners that is important but not yet addressed
- Demonstrating how the existing literature can mislead our thinking
:::

## Forumula

@recker2021scientific summarizes his learnings in following "formula":

:::{.incremental}
- Paragraph 1 – **Hook**		  
    Motivation, need, ‘hook’
- Paragraph 2 – **Gap**		
    Situate in research – identify opportunity
- Paragraph 3 – **Study**		
    How investigate?  Process, context & why?
- Paragraph 4 – **Conclusion**    
    Findings, framework, contribution
- Paragraph 5 – **Outline**   
    Outline the paper:  first …, second …, then … and, we conclude with …
:::

:::{.notes}
The formula in 9 sentences:

- **Hook**
    - Sentence stating what the domain is and why it is important.
    - What is the overall problem or situation in that domain
- **Gap**
    - What are the conclusions of existing literature for that problem / situation in this domain? 
    - What is the problem or issue with that existing literature?
- **Study**
    - Indicate that this study addresses that problem or issue and state how.
    - Describe the study, sample, and method for addressing that problem or issue.
- **Conclusion**
    - Describe what you found.
    - State explicitly how these findings extend and contribute to existing knowledge. 
- **Outline**
    - Describe the overall outline of the paper. 
:::


## Discover! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

Read the introduction of a paper you like or of @strich2021world (search for it at Google Scholar) and decompose it.

Does it follow the "script"?
Is the introduction persuasive? Why?

# Background

This section provides everything **needed to understand your research processes and results**.

:::{.incremental}
- Relevant theories
- Relevant concepts that you need
- Relevant previous methods, algorithms, findings, and arguments on which your work is based
:::

. . .

**Not more. Not less.**

. . .

The background is not a recapitulation, listing, or critique of *all* other work in this area, nor is it a list of concepts.

:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
#### Tips for writing the theory section
- Organise the section according to topics, not as a list of studies.
- Discuss related work, rather than just listing it.
- Explain how your work complements others’ work.
- Explain how your work contradicts previous work.
- Highlight areas in which your work builds on others’ work. Keep it concise.’
:::
:::


## Discover! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

Read the background section of a paper you like or of @strich2021world and decompose it.

- Does the background provide everything that is needed to understand the research (until here)? 
- Is something missing? 
- Seems something to be irrelevant?

# Theory

This is **not** where you discuss an existing theory but where you develop **new** theory—**where the magic happens** [@recker2021scientific].


. . .

Provides an overview of the theoretical constructs and their relationships being studied in an empirical research.

:::{.incremental}
- Overview of the conceptual or research model that is being developed
- Strong argument for the hypotheses, related to existing research 
- Key literature should already have been introduced in the background section
- Keep your hypotheses simple but precise
:::

. . .

In an exploratory research (mainly qualitative), the theoretical sensibility and possibly initial assumptions that guide the research are presented.

:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
#### Tips for writing [@recker2021scientific]
- Start with an overview of conceptual or research model being developed.
- Discuss components of the model in paragraphs with relevant subheadings that reflect the model.
- Follow a disciplined structure that moves from concepts to associations to laws to boundaries.
- Each hypothesis must be preceded by a strong argument as to why it should hold.
- Explain concepts or constructs in tables
- Differentiate between conceptual level (abstact) and empirical level (operationalization)
- When developing hypotheses, do not use words like "prove" but use words like "suggest" or "support."
:::
:::

## Discover! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

Have a look at the theory section of a quantitative paper you like or of @wang2022product and read it. 

- Analyze the hypotheses developed and check if they stick to the recommendations outlined here. 
- Is the justification strong enough to stand up to your critical eye?
- How is the research model visualized?

# Methods

This section describes **how the research was carried out**. Key elements are

:::{.incremental}
- The justification of a research strategy.
- Materials, case sites, scope of survey, appropriate samples, participant selection and all other decisions related to the research design.
- Detailed and precise description of the measurements (quantitative) or data collection techniques (qualitative) used
- The data analysis techniques in used.
:::

. . .

The objective is to enable anyone to repeat the research (replicability).


:::{.notes}
:::{.callout-note}
#### Established scripts fopr the method section [@recker2021scientific]

- *Experiment paper*: experimental design, variables and measures, materials, tasks, procedures, and participants.
- *Quantitative paper*: design, measures, sampling strategy, procedures, and validation of measures. 
- *Qualitative paper*: empirical setting, modes of data collection, and processes and techniques employed in data analysis.
- *Design science papers*: overview, meta-requirements or design principles, artefact description, and evaluation.
:::
:::

# Findings

This section **describes the evidence gathered** (“this is what we found out”).

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- It only contains a description of findings (factual result reporting, **past tense**)
- It includes appropriate statistical tests or other analyses
    - Writing, statistics, and graphs should be presented as simply as possible
    - Irrelevant data (i.e., data do which the discussion will not refer and vice versa) should be excluded
- It does not include a discussion or interpretation of the findings
:::

. . .

This section is easy to write and quite methodical-check published papers that use similar methods

# Discussion

This section is all about the contributions and implications—**it is where the paper becomes most interesting.**

. . .

It usually starts with a summary of the main findings.

. . .

Then proceeds with their interpretation (sensemaking, **present tense**):   
*What do they actually mean? Why did you get the results that you obtained?*

:::{.incremental}
- **Explaining** the results: why did you find what you found?
- **Abstracting** the results to concepts: what does it mean in a larger view?
- **Theorizing** the results: what do they tell us about the existing/new theory?
:::

. . .

Keep the discussion to the results.

:::{.notes}
Note: Some readers tend to skim papers, read the intro, take a glimpse on figures and tables and then devote their attention mostly to this section.
:::

## Implications

Implications can be part of the discussion; since they are very important, they sometimes get their own section [@recker2021scientific].

. . .

Papers should have implications for ongoing research *and* practice.

. . .

**Implications for practice**: detail how the study findings change/impact the way that important stakeholders work in actual practice.

. . .

**Implications for research**:

:::{.incremental}
- What did we find that can guide future research?
- What opportunities for future research arise from the study described?
- What new questions arise from the way the research question was answered in the paper?
:::

## Visualization

:::{.notes}
Implications should be visualized to enhance understanding and make them catchy.
:::

![Visualizing theoretical implications in @li2013motivational](images/visualization.jpg)

## Discover! {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff" background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

Have a look at the discussion section of one of the papers analyzed so far and mark the summary, explanations, abstractions, theorizing, and implications (if applicable)

## Conclusion

This section is optional and provides the closing frame to a paper [@recker2021scientific].

:::{.incremental}
- Is often not much more than an abstract statement.
- Briefly summarizes the main contributions of the paper (no details).
- Reflects on the research findings presented in the paper.
- Never introduces new material or new findings.
- As a rule of thumb, do not cite anything.
