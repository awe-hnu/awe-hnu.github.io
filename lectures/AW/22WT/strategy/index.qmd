## Research process

Good research starts with a problem and requires the following steps to address the problem:

. . .

Step 1: **Motivation** (relevance, scope, and research question)

:::{.slide-hidden} 
- State the topic
- Explain why it is relevant
- Describe what we already know, explain the problem or challenge (what we do not know but should know)
- Formulate a clear research question addressing the problem or challenge
- Delimit the research (what is within the scope and what is out of scope)
:::

. . . 
    
Step 2: **Theory** (concepts and interrelations)

:::{.slide-hidden} 
- Choose theoretical basis for analysis and introduce it
- Define all technical terms
- Forward a research model and posit hypotheses or explicate your theoretical sensitivity
:::

. . .

Step 3: **Method** (approach to knowlege generation)

:::{.slide-hidden} 
- Define an adequate (empirical) method (and sample) that allows you to study the phenomenon and generate data to answer the research question
- Address validity and reliability issues
:::

. . .

Step 4: **Analysis** (evaluation of data)

:::{.slide-hidden} 
- Analyze the collected data
- Document the analysis and the findings
:::

. . .

Step 5: **Interpretation** (implications)

:::{.slide-hidden} 
- Interpret the analysis to answer the research question and to derive management recommendations
- Reflect contributions and limitations
:::

. . .

If the research was successful, the process ends with the dissemination of the knowledge generated—the **publication**.

## Discuss! {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What do you think, how important are publications to a academic career?

## Publish or perish

![The evolution of academia](images/publish-perish.jpg){#fig-publishPerish}

## Importance of publication

Publications are key to any academic career

:::{.incremental}
- Publications are key for universities (reputation, funds, etc.)
- Papers make research outcomes last as additions to the body of knowledge
- Papers are the main **proof of valid research activity**
- Papers are the best way for you to **market your skills and creativity**
- Papers are the best mechanism for **getting feedback** about your research
- Papers helps you become a **member of a research community**
- Writing helps **clarify your ideas** and fit them into the discussions in the field
:::

## You are what you publish

Publications are the most important KPIs of a researcher—they shape the career path in academia [@recker2021scientific].

:::{.incremental}
- **Number of peer-reviewed publications**    
  (e.g., Assistant Professor in the US requires minimum 8+ journal articles in 6 years to achieve tenure; German universities usually expects around 6 or more A+ journal articles for a W3 professor)
- **Quality of peer-reviewed publications**    
  Citations to your paper (e.g. H-index[^H-index]) and the type and quality of the outlet in which your paper is published (e.g., journal impact factor, journal ratings)
:::

. . .

Academics are ranked, literally, and publications are the most important factor (e.g., [AIS Research Ranking](https://www.aisresearchrankings.org/))

[H-index]: A researcher with an index of *h* has published *h* papers with at least *h* citations each.

## What do you publish?

**Scientific papers are about research.**

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- Papers cover the process and, importantly, the outcomes of a scientific activity.
- Writing papers typically means that the research has been completed[^publication-bias].
:::

. . .

**Good papers require good research, good research requires good writing** [@recker2021scientific, p. 168]

::: {.incremental}
- Purposive and objective
- Replicable procedures
- Appropriate conclusions
:::

[^publication-bias]: Typically only “successful research” is being published.

## Impact matters!

**Dissemination is not impact**: You do not succeed as a scientist by getting papers published. You succeed by creating impact.

. . .

#### What is impact?

. . .

Resonance in a cumulative tradition, which indicates that a paper helps to actually solve the problem being researched.

. . .

Few publications create impact [@recker2021scientific]:

. . .

- 30% of papers are never cited
- 20-30% of papers attract 80% of citations

## Success requires a strategy

In this chapter, we touch three important strategic considerations that will impact your writing:

:::{.incremental}
- **Where to publish** good research?
- **How to prepare** to write a successful paper?
- **How to set-up the process** of writing?
:::

# Publication {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

How to find a suitable puplication outlet?

## Initial remarks

Publication outlets differ **widely** in quality[@recker2021scientific]

:::{.incremental}
- *Good* outlets will only accept *good* papers describing *good* research
- Publish high-impact papers in high-quality outlets
:::

. . .

Open publishing process

:::{.incremental}
- Once you publish, your ideas are out there (you can't withdraw them)
- Published research will impact your reputation
:::

. . .

Once you published a result, you can’t publish it again (one-stop option)

## Enumerate! {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What different publication formats exist?

## Publication formats

There are a variety of different publication formats.

. . .

- (Edited) Books
- Book chapters
- Journal articles
- Conference papers
- Workshop papers
- Technical reports

And many more.

## Think! {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

What are the differences?

## Books

Scholars also write entire books or refereed book chapter in edited books. 

. . .

However, some universities do not count them at all as publications as part of promotion or tenure decisions.

. . .

#### Implications

Scholars typically contribute fewer to books than they write journal articles because book chapters are not considered as important (even though peer-reviewed).

. . .

*This not imply that the quality of these writings is generally worse (or better) than that of a journal article (at least if good review processes are in place).*

## Conference proceedings

The purpose of conferences is often to allow scientists to present their **ongoing research** to the community for opinions, feedback, and new ideas.

. . .

Papers presented at conferences are usually intended as an **intermediate step** in the research and publication process, **not as an end goal**.

. . .

#### Implications

:::{.incremental}
- Conference papers are usually shorter than journal articles and often describe research in progress.
- The review process for most conferences is much shorter and far less rigorous than for a good journal.
:::

## Journals

In most scientific fields, the highest-quality publications are those published in a (defined) number of **top-tier journals**.

. . .

Ranking list evaluate journals based on metrics such as impact factor, readership, editorial board composition, and other criteria, e.g.

:::{.incremental}
- In IS, a consortium of reputable scholars has jointly defined a set of eight elite journals— the [Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals](https://aisnet.org/page/SeniorScholarBasket)
- In Germany, the German Association for Business School Professors ranks a list of journals that are relevant to business school researchers—the [JourQual](https://vhbonline.org/en/vhb4you/vhb-jourqual/vhb-jourqual-3)
- The Financial Times lists the 50 most renowned journals in the field of management—the [FT50 List](https://www.ft.com/content/3405a512-5cbb-11e1-8f1f-00144feabdc0)
:::

. . .

The journal impact factor (IF) is a measure of the frequency with which the "average article" in a journal has been cited in a particular year [^impactFactor].

[^impactFactor]: A = the number of times articles published in 2019 and 2020 were cited during 2021; B = the total number of ‘citable items’ published by that journal in 2019 and 2020; 2021 impact factor = A / B

## Do! {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

Check which journals have published the most interesting papers you have read in the last few weeks. Check their impact factor and consider whether it reflects your perception of quality. And think about why (or why not)?

## Which outlet to choose?

**Journals are selective** in what they publish—they only look for certain types of contributions [@recker2021scientific].

. . .

#### Implications

:::{.incremental}
- Inform yourself about the aims and audiences the journal is interested in
- Submit papers only to journals that
    - want to publish the type of contribution your research makes and
    - adress the same audience
- Check if you have cited papers from the journal you aim at
- Read many papers of the journal to familiarize yourself with the style and quality
:::

## Deciding on a target outlet

In deciding on a target outlet, consider five questions [@recker2021scientific, p. 175]:

- What journals did you consult most when doing the research?
- How well do you know the outlet?
- Do you meet the outlet’s requirements for submissions?
- What is the audience and pool of reviewers?    
    Who reads the journal and who publishes in it?      
    Who will decide on your submission and how?
- How low should you go?

## Do! {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg" .unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden}

Have a look at the [AIS Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals](https://aisnet.org/page/SeniorScholarBasket) and select the journal for which you could write a paper that reports the findings of your master thesis. 

- Why have you selected the journal?
- Are the oulined requirements for submission helpful?

. . .

**Homework:** Select two papers published in the journal that serves as the inspiration for your study, identify the strengths, and add them to a list that you can use to review your own work later.

# Preparation {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

How to prepare to write a successful paper?

## Read before you write

![Reading is key for getting to know the "voice" of the journal](images/reading.jpg){#fig-reading}

:::{.notes}
Reading is not only required for doing good research, also to get familiar with the “voice” of studies published in the journals you want to submit [@recker2021scientific, p. 171].
:::

## Write early and write often

Don't wait until the research is fully completed. 

. . .

Start with targeting a conference (e.g., research and progress) and then a reasonably good journal.

#### Aditional tipps

:::{.incremental}
- Treat the proposal of your research as being your first paper that will be reviewed (see [assignment](../assignment) for this lecture)
- Write a first draft of the introduction early on (see [assignment](../assignment) for this lecture)
- During research: identify some areas of your work that are (nearly) completed, and start writing
:::

## Write research-based papers

Don't plan to write only because of a deadline for a particular conference or journal issue submission (*paper-based research*)

. . .

Plan to write a paper because the research is finished and successful in terms of useful results (*research-based paper*) [@recker2021scientific, p. 172].

. . .

:::{.smaller}
| Paper-based research                                | Research-based paper                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Often deadline-driven                               | Often results-driven                             |
| Works reasonable well for conference submissions    | Often "too much to write about" for a conference |
| Does not work well for publication in good journals | Works well for publications in journals          |
| Rarely works for a thesis                           | Works well for a thesis                          |
:::

## Staff a team

In scientific publications, co-authored articles are the rule, not the exception.

. . .

Look for **complementarity of skills** and **alignment in working styles** [@recker2021scientific, p. 172].

. . .

#### Tasks that can be shared

. . .

:::{.incremental}
- Developing an original idea
- Designing a study
- Organizing data collection
- Collecting data
- Analyzing data
- Writing and revising a paper
:::

:::{.notes}
Additional tipps @recker2021scientific shares for collaboration:

- Make one’s investment in and contribution to the project clear
- Create transparency about publication strategies
- Recognizing each other’s goals and contributions
- Be flexible, and
- Establishing the criteria for making decisions
:::

# Process {.vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

What does the process for writing a scientific paper look like?

## Writing process

:::{.incremental}
1. Develop an outline with a structure
2. Revise the structure
3. Start populating the sections   
    *This typically is not sequential    
    The introduction is often the hardest part to write    
    Methods is the easiest and can be started early*
4. Revise the sections
5. Revise the paper/thesis
6. Put it in a drawer, take it out, read again, revise again
7. Send it to a friendly reviewer and (professional) copy editor
8. Submit
:::

## Publication process

![Publication process in peer-reviewed outlets](images/review-process.svg){#fig-reviewProcess}

:::{.notes}
Scholarly publications “count” as scientific publications only if they are peer-reviewed:

- Before a paper is published, it is reviewed by experts in the same field.
- This requires a community of experts in a narrowly defined field who are qualified to conduct an impartial review
- In most cases, this is a double-blind process: Authors and reviewers do not know each other's identity

The review process is managed by an editorial team (usually a senior and an associate editor):

- An editor is usually a successful senior scientist who is familiar with the manuscript's subject area
- She makes the decision on whether to publish the manuscript

## Confessions {.unlisted .unnumbered .htlm-hidden .vertical-center background-color=blue background-image="../assets/bg.jpg"}

> It is natural to feel bad about rejections. Unfortunately, I get them all the time too. Academia is a pretty brutal profession in that regard and I wouldn’t want to convey otherwise. *Jan Recker*

## Thesis timeline

Now, coming back to your master's thesis (which might end in an publication)—a focused schedule looks like that:

:::{.incremental}
- Topic identification and proposal (before registration): *it depends ...*
- Literature review and research model/framework: *6 weeks*
- Preparation of the empirical part: *2 weeks*
- Data collection and analysis: *4 weeks*
- Conclusions, recommendations and "finishing": *4 weeks*
:::

. . .

When planning the timeline, consider holidays and so called freezes (typically from mid December to mid January), in particular, if you need interview partners–they might be not available during these periods of time.


# Wrap-up

Developing a manuscript takes a good strategy and a lot time and effort.    
@recker2021scientific reminds us that ...

:::{.incremental}
1. ... **writing is a process that takes time.**     
    Dedicate resources to this task. Make it a priority.
2. ... **writing is a skill that must be developed and refined**     
    Spend time on learning how to write better. Read before you write, learn from professionals, editors, and of course engage in learning by doing.
3. ... **writing benefits from reviewing**.     
    While you can learn a great deal from reading papers that have been published, you can often learn even more from manuscripts that were written and submitted but may never be published.
4. ... **good writing comes** from revising, polishing, and editing, over and over.
