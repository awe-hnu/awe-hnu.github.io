# Task

:::medium
You need to apply what you have learned and prepare a __proposal for your master's thesis__.
:::

You will go through key academic writing processes over the course of the semester, from finding a topic, writing a proposal, gathering feedback and writing a research project (RIP). You will complete several deliverables in the process. These will reflect your learning progress and will be graded individually.

# Deliverables

You need to deliver following parts via Moodle:

:::{.incremental}
- __Initial thesis proposal__ (ungraded but mandatory; details see [template](assets/AW_Proposal_Template.docx)),
- __Round-table discussion__ (bonus points),
- __Research in-progress (RIP) paper__ (revision and extension of the initial proposal; details see [template](assets/AW_RIP-Paper_Template.docx)),
- Reflection of the __lessons learned__ (details see [template](assets/AW_Lessons-Learned_Template.docx)).
:::

. . .

For deadlines, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

The deliverables are graded individually and determine the grade with the following weights:

:::{.incremental}
- 70% __research in-progress (RIP) paper__,
- 30% __lessons learned__ plus
- Bonus points for you contributions in the __round-table discussions__[^bonus]
:::

. . .

__Note:__ Compliance with formal requirements (see templates) and good scientific practice are critical pass criteria for all parts, means that in case of non-compliance the exam is automatically failed (e.g., plagiarism, even light forms).

[^bonus]: The bonus points are assigned based on your engagement in the discussions (particularly the quality of your feedback). These can improve your performance by up to one grade increments (up to .7).
