# Task

:::medium
You need to apply what you have learned and prepare a __proposal for your master's thesis__.
:::

You will go through key academic writing processes over the course of the semester, from finding a topic, writing a proposal, gathering feedback and writing a research project (RIP). You will complete several deliverables in the process. These will reflect your learning progress and will be graded individually.

# Deliverables

You need to deliver following parts via Moodle:

:::{.incremental}
- __Initial thesis proposal__ (ungraded but mandatory; details see [template](assets/AW_Proposal_Template.docx)),
- __Round-table discussion__ (bonus points),
- __Research in-progress (RIP) paper__ (revision and extension of the initial proposal; details see [template](assets/AW_RIP-Paper_Template.docx)),
- Reflection of the __lessons learned__ (details see [template](assets/AW_Lessons-Learned_Template.docx)).
:::

. . .

For deadlines, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

The deliverables are graded individually and determine the grade with the following weights:

:::{.incremental}
- 70% __research in-progress (RIP) paper__,
- 30% __lessons learned__ plus
- Bonus points for you contributions in the __round-table discussions__[^bonus]
:::

. . .

__Note:__ Compliance with formal requirements (see templates) and good scientific practice are critical pass criteria for all parts, means that in case of non-compliance the exam is automatically failed (e.g., plagiarism, even light forms).

[^bonus]: The bonus points are assigned based on your engagement in the discussions (particularly the quality of your feedback). These can improve your performance by up to one grade increments (up to .7).

## Research-in-progress-paper {.scrollable}

::: incremental
- The proposal addresses a clear problem that is significant and interesting.
- The research question (or research aim) is clearly stated and justified.
- All core concepts are clearly defined.
- The references to the current literature are clearly shown.
- The potential contributions of the thesis are getting clear.
- The proposal tells a conclusive story.
- The thesis proposal is well aligned to the audience and testifies professionalism.

:::

## Lessons learned {.scrollable}

A summary of lessons learned that fulfills expectations has the following characteristics

::: incremental
- The learning progress is thoroughly reflected (i.e., the challenges, feedback, tools)
- The lessons learned are plausible
:::

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum. 
:::

| Grade                    | Meaning
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` ‚Äî very   good            | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` ‚Äî good                   | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a ‚Äúgood performance‚Äù.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                   | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an ‚Äúaverage   performance‚Äù*                                                                                             |
| `3` ‚Äî satisfactory           | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` ‚Äî sufficient             | [A   performance that ‚Äústill adequately satisfies‚Äù the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` ‚Äî not   sufficient      | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}
