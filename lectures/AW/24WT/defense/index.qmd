# Introduction  {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Basics

If your paper is accepted to be presented at an conference, you need to deliver an **oral presentation of your work**.

. . .

If you want to obtain a university degree, you have to **defend your thesis**, usually in front of two or more examiners and possibly the interested public.

. . .

Both run very similarly:

- You give your presentation (usually with slides)
- The committee and/or the public will ask questions about your research after you finished your presentation

:::{.notes}
#### Tell a convincing story

- You can't present all you have doneâ€”**tell a convincing story** that portraits your research well and leave room for questions
- Do not plan for more then **1 slide per 2 minutes**, rather less
- It's a scientific presentation, so don't forget good practices (e.g., references)
- **Prepare properly**, practice your talk and make sure it fits the time limitations, you know your slides and you have opening and closing statements prepared

#### Design high-quality slides [@hytonSlides]

- Do not plan for ideal conditions, make sure that everyone can see and read the contents
- Avoid fancy backgrounds on your slides
- Use readable typography (sans-serif, appropriate weight)
- Don't overload your slides (e.g., use only the upper two thirds of the slides, try to use not text at all)
- Put page numbers on your slides

#### Anticipate questions and prepare for them

- **Sit at other defenses** of your supervisors to get a feeling for how and what they ask
- Do a **dry-run** in front of a friendly audience to spot topics that trigger questions
- Create a list of possible questions and prepare answers
- Prepare for questions you don't know the answer ("I don't know, but I would think [...]")

#### Have a backup plan

Technology is unpredictable. Life is too. 

- Ask a trusted person to be ready to help you out
- Put your slides on a cloud storage
- Prepare handouts if technology fails
- If its a public presentation, I would bring an extra shirt ;-)
