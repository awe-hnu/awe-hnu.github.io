# Ethical strategy {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Why strategy?

Following concerns make the idea of an *ethical strategy* relevant:

[as they may cause long-term damage, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[as they are difficult to turn, and]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[as the question of doing right is not easy.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::
:::

:::notes
- The concept of ethics and morals applies to corporations just as it applies to individuals/humans. 
- Wrong actions by companies can not only prove expensive, but also cause long-term damage.
- The nature of the planning and implementation process in companies makes it difficult to change course mid-way.
- The changing perceptions of what is considered ethical or unethical makes the process complex as well.

# Business ethics {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Reflection {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

:::large
What is ethics?
:::

## Ethics

:::medium
> Ethics is the branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending **concepts of right and wrong conduct.** *@enwiki:1181606843*
:::

. . .

The term comes from the Greek word 'ethos,' which means character. Ethical theories reflect on **what is morally good and how individuals ought to behave**, offering guidance for making moral decisions.

## Reflection {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

:::large
Is there a moral (or social) responsibility for firms?
:::

If so, what is the extend and type of the responsibiliy?

## Corporate moral responsibility

:::medium
[Firms do not function in a vacuum.]{.fragment .fade-in} [They function in the **context of a (wider) social environment**]{.fragment .fade-in}[, which imposes on them **certain moral demands and responsibilities**]{.fragment .fade-in} [@mintzberg2014strategy]{.fragment .smaller}
:::

:::notes
- A company is a collection of human and social groupings. 
- General expectations regarding acceptable conduct of others underpins such groupings.  
- Values such as loyalty, credibility, diligence, cooperation, moral conduct, etc. are manifest in organisations, or at least, expected. 
:::

## Ethic in business

:::html-hidden
:::fragment
:::medium
Business ethics refers to the principles of [right and wrong conduct within organizations]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} that [guide decision making and behavior]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} [@david2016strategic]{.smaller}.
:::
:::
:::

:::notes
The term business ethics emphasizes the importance of aligning business activities with ethical principles. It is a form of *applied ethics* that deals with ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. IT encompasses all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the behavior of individuals and entire organizations.

Business ethics, according to @drucker1981business, is about ensuring that business practices, decisions, and operations adhere to ethical standards and contribute positively to society while fulfilling the company's objectives and obligations to its stakeholders.
:::

## Values

**The right conduct** includes those lines of actions that are desirable in terms of the objectives and (moral) values of our society [@bowen1953social]. 

:::medium
[Morality is an aspect of culture—different cultures have different moral systems. ]{.fragment .fade-in} [Moral values also change over time.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::notes
- Some moral values change slowly, over centuries
- Others change more quickly, needing just decades.
- Catastrophic events such as war, genocide, epidemic diseases, etc. may cause moral values to change abruptly.
:::

## Relevant social and cultural changes

Two social and cultural changes are to be expected that could lead to ethical conflicts (of strategic concern for corporations) in the future [@mintzberg2014strategy]:

:::medium
[The effect of rapid technological development]{.fragment .fade-in} [& cultural effects of environmental changes]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::notes
- Digitization and other technological developments may lead to infringement of the personal integrity of anyone coming into contact with the modern corporation. In addition, the increasingly fast pace of action leaves little time for reflection, and weakens the moral basis of business practices.
- The awareness of environmental issues, e.g., pollution, environmental ethics, the effect of wrong practices on future generations, has given rise to a new category of moral and ethical concerns.

## Implications

:::html-hidden
:::medium
[Develop ethics sensitivity, ]{.fragment .fade-in}
[educating employees, ]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[expressing moral convictions clearly and consistently, ]{.fragment .fade-in} 
[and predicting and preparing for the future.]{.fragment .fade-in} 
:::
:::

:::notes
Given that there are always grounds for ethical strategic concerns, it is desirable to develop ethics sensitivity in the company, and a routine to probe the general ethical climate of the firm [@mintzberg2014strategy].

Codes of conduct are a useful means of influencing the ethical climate in the company if they are not enforced through control systems and sanctions. They are an effective means of educating employees, especially when management visibly supports and emphasizes them.

A clear and consistent expression of moral convictions has a strong unifying cultural effect in the organization and gives it the intellectual power to manage ethical conflicts and avoid critical pitfalls.

Another aspect of ethical strategy is predicting and preparing for the future, for example by anticipating possible cultural and value-related changes.

![The CSR pyramid [@carroll1991pyramid]](images/CSR-pyramid.svg){#fig-pyramid}

The CSR pyramid helps managers to recognize that different types of obligations are in constant tension with each other and are not mutually exclusive [@carroll1991pyramid]. The model includes economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic (discretionary) expectations that society has of organizations at a given point in time.

| Type of Responsibility               | Societal Expectation                        | Explanations                                                |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Economic responsibility              | *Required* of business by society           | Be profitable. Maximize sales, minimize costs               |
| Legal responsibility                 | *Required* of business by society           | Obey all laws, adhere to all regulations                    |
| Ethical responsibility               | *Expected* of business by society           | Do what is right, fair, and just. Assert ethical leadership |
| Philanthropic responsibility         | *Desired/expected* of business by society   | Be a good corporate citizen.                                |

: The levels of the CSR pyramid [@carroll1991pyramid] {#tbl-pyramid}

### Economic responsibilities 

Firm has a responsibility to use the resources available to produce goods and services for society.

Economic responsibilities most dramatically impact owners, shareholders, and employees.

#### Examples

- Generating a high and consistent level of profitability 
- Establishing and maintaining a strong competitive position
- Operating the firm at a high efficiency level


### Legal Responsibilities

The laws and regulations that all firms are expected to follow as they perform their daily functions. 

Legal responsibilities are certainly crucial with respect to owners and shareholders (i.e., employees and consumer stakeholders).

#### Examples 

- Operating consistent with government and legal expectations
- Showing complete compliance with all regulations

### Ethical Responsibilities

Change over time because they are based on expectations of society.

Ethical responsibilities affect all stakeholder groups (i.e., consumers, employees, and the environment).

#### Examples

- Meeting expectations of both social and ethical standards
- Ability to adapt to new or developing ethical and moral standards

### Philanthropic Responsibilities  (Discretionary Responsibilities)

Those responsibilities in which society does not have a clear message to present to businesses as to what their courses of action should be. 
Left in the hands of managers to make the right judgment. 

Philanthropic responsibilities most affect the community.

#### Examples

- Giving to charitable organizations
- Providing drug treatment programs

## Reflection {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

:::medium
Does it pay to be socially responsible?
:::

Take 20 minutes, discuss your insights from reading @barnett2012does, find reasons for why CSR might impact financial performance positively, give real-life examples and derive activities or characteristics of socially responsible companies.

Prepare to present your findings in a 5 to 10 minutes presentation.

:::notes
Economists generally say no, and philantropists say yes to this question. 

Recent research by @barnett2012does suggest a U-shaped relationship between social and financial performance for many organizations. They propose that moderate social responsibility can positively impact financial performance, but there might be diminishing returns or potential negative effects beyond a certain point of social responsibility.

The authors emphasize that while a moderate level of social responsibility can be associated with improved financial performance, pursuing excessive social responsibility might not necessarily lead to better financial results. They suggest that companies need to find an optimal level of social responsibility that aligns with their strategic goals and business context.

@barnett2012does offer insights into the complex relationship between social and financial performance in organizations, highlighting that while being socially responsible can positively influence financial outcomes to a certain extent, an excessively high level of social responsibility might not always be conducive to improved financial performance. The findings call for a strategic balance in integrating social responsibility into business practices.
