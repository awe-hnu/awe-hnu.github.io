![Formal management control system [@anthony2014management, p. 105]](images/mcs.svg){#fig-mangementControlSystem}

Management control’s task is the implementation of the set organizational strategies, which means that divergences have to be controlled. Thus, MCS are defined as “[...] system[s] used by
management to control the activities of an organization is called management control
system” [@anthony2014management, p. 17].

Such traditional management control approaches often focus on top-down command and control mechanisms, where authority and decision-making are centralized at the top levels of the organization. The emphasis is on planning, setting targets, monitoring performance, and taking corrective actions if necessary. The control mechanisms are typically based on formal rules, procedures, and hierarchical structures.
