## Reflection {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

Form small groups of 3 to 4 students, take 10 minutes to discuss your findings from reading @chakravarthy1986measuring and to create a 5 minutes presentation that answers following questions: 

- Why is it difficult to accurately measure strategic performance?
- Why are traditional financial metrics limited in capturing the strategic impact of various strategic initiatives and decisions?
- How can the the quality of a firm’s adaptation be evaluated?
- How should, according to the findings of the study, strategic performance be evaluated?
- How do the findings relate to the balanced score card method?

![@anthony2014management's perspective on management control](images/management-control.svg){#fig-managementControl}

- **Organization structure** specifies the roles, reporting relationships, and division of - responsibilities that shape the decision-making within an organization.
- **Human resource management** is the selection, training, evaluation, promotion, and termination of employees so as to develop the knowledge and skills required to execute organizational strategy.
- **Culture** refers to a set of common beliefs, attitudes, and norms that explicitly or implicitly guide managerial actions.

![Formal management control system [@anthony2014management, p. 105]](images/mcs.svg){#fig-mangementControlSystem}

Management control’s task is the implementation of the set organizational strategies, which means that divergences have to be controlled. Thus, MCS are defined as “[...] system[s] used by
management to control the activities of an organization is called management control
system” [@anthony2014management, p. 17].

Such traditional management control approaches often focus on top-down command and control mechanisms, where authority and decision-making are centralized at the top levels of the organization. The emphasis is on planning, setting targets, monitoring performance, and taking corrective actions if necessary. The control mechanisms are typically based on formal rules, procedures, and hierarchical structures.

:::notes
@mintzberg2000rise structures traditional planning into two domains—performance control and action planning.

**Performance control** imposes general performance standards (i.e., desired output) over a period of time, with no reference to specific actions and assess whether or not that standard has been achieved. The purpose of performance control is to regulate the overall results of a given unit. Objectives, budgets, operating plans, and various other kinds of generalo standards are established for the unit, and its performance is later measured in terms of these standards and the results fed back up the hierarchy.

**Action planning** specifies decision that call for specific actions—to market new products, build new factories, sell old machines. Some of the proposed actions may be taken within single units, but others can cut acrros unit boundaries. By its imposition of specific decisions, action planning turns out to be a less than pure form of standardizing outputs; more exactly, it falls between that and standardizing work processes.

So whereas performance control says, "Increase sales by 10 percent this year [in any way you care to]", action planning says, "Do it by introducing blue widgets". 

The diagram in @fig-hierarchies explains how performance control and action planning work. The arrows in the diagram go in both directions, showing that performance control can happen in two ways. The first way is top-down, where objectives set by top management become more detailed as they move down the hierarchy. The second way is bottom-up, where lower-level units set their own performance standards. These standards are then combined as they move up the hierarchy and eventually become overall objectives for the entire organization at the top level.

In real-world practice, the performance control system is likely to operate not just as a pure top-down or bottom-up process, but as a combination of both. Some performance standards are detailed by top management and trickle down the hierarchy, while others are proposed by employees and aggregate up. At each level, managers try to set standards for their teams, and employees may suggest less strict ones. Through this negotiation process, a mix of composite and detailed performance standards emerges at all levels of the organization.

The action planning system primarily follows a top-down approach. In theory, it starts with strategic planning, where the organization evaluates its strengths and weaknesses based on environmental trends. It then creates a comprehensive set of strategies for the future. These strategies are translated into programs, which involve specific capital projects (e.g., launching a new product line and constructing a new factory) or operating projects (i.e., projects where costs are not capitalized typically evolving around enhancing and streamlining existing operations such as developing a marketing campaign). These programs are further detailed and scheduled, eventually becoming specific operating specifications that prompt direct actions.

## Conventional strategic planning

## Strategic planning as a “numbers game”

![Strategic planning as a “numbers game” according to @mintzberg2000rise](images/planning-2.svg){#fig-planning_2}

:::notes
In certain organizations, strategic planning gives excessive importance to the quantitative aspect. Mintzberg refers to this as the *numbers game* and criticizes it for being a "ritualistic strategy formation" that hinders real strategic change. Characteristics include being top-down, driven by numbers, and formalistic.
:::

## Capital budgeting as ad hoc control

![Capital budgeting as ad hoc control](images/planning-3.svg){#fig-planning_3}


:::notes
The third type of strategic planning is on the action planning side of the diagram, but it's unique because it moves upward, bypassing the *mysterious process of strategy formation*. This is primarily capital budgeting, a system for approving major capital expenditures. It is characterized by being bottom-up driven and more ad-hoc than planned.

# Performance measurement frameworks {.vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Overview

:::large
[Du Pont Pyramid,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Tableau du Bord,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Balanced Scorecard,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[Performance Pyramid,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
[and Performance Prism.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
:::

:::notes
- The **Du Pont Pyramid** focuses on analyzing return on investment (ROI) by breaking it down into key financial ratios. It examines profitability through the relationships between net income, sales, and asset turnover. The framework is useful for understanding the drivers of financial performance.
- A **Tableau du Bord** (a French term for "dashboard") provides a comprehensive approach to performance measurement. It encompasses both financial and non-financial metrics, presenting a holistic view of organizational performance. This framework is particularly useful for monitoring and managing various aspects of performance in a visually intuitive manner.
- The **Balanced Scorecard** is a strategic performance measurement framework that takes a balanced approach by considering multiple perspectives. It includes financial metrics along with customer satisfaction, internal processes, and learning and growth. This framework is valuable for aligning organizational activities with the overall strategy and ensuring a balanced assessment of performance.
- The **Performance Pyramid** offers a hierarchical representation of performance metrics, starting from financial indicators at the top and extending to operational metrics at the base. This framework organizes metrics into different levels based on their strategic relevance and impact. It provides a structured approach to performance measurement with a clear linkage to strategic goals.
- The **Performance Prism** is a holistic framework that goes beyond traditional measures by considering stakeholders and their interests. It incorporates key elements such as stakeholders, strategies, processes, capabilities, and stakeholder satisfaction. This framework is valuable for providing a broader perspective on performance and assessing the impact on various stakeholders.

Each framework offers a unique perspective on performance measurement. A combination of these frameworks may provide a more comprehensive understanding of performance.

## Group work {.unlisted .unnumbered .html-hidden .unlisted background-color="#000"}

Form small groups of 3 to 4 students, take 15 minutes to do a research on one of the frameworks and to prepare a short presentation (5 minutes) that summarizes the key-tenets of the framework.

Prepare yourself to present your insights.

## Conclusion

The frameworks reflect key ideas to today's understanding of performance measurement system design:

:::incremental
- Inclusion of non-financial and financial metrics
- Creating a balanced set of multidimensional measures
- Identifying trade-offs between measures
- Include a mix of historical or lagged indicators and predictive measures
- Linking measures in terms of a cascading system and means-ends relationships
- Linking measures and targets with actions
- Inclusion of internal (e.g. costs, quality) and external perspectives (e.g. competitiveness)
- The integration of multiple stakeholders
- The dynamics of performance measurement systems over time (with changing priorities and strategic focus)
