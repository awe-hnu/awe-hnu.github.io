# Task

During the semester you will be required to **analyse a future technology**, its characteristics, use and implications.

. . .

You can make proposals on the topic you want to work for. However, the final assignment will be made by me.

. . .

You need to do research on

::: incremental
- the characteristics of the technology (e.g., based on the characteristics discussed in lecture), 
- fields of applications,
- the potential of the technology to transform these,
- risks related to its use,
- as well as social and ethical implications.
:::

. . .

You can include grey literature^[White papers, books, web-sources, etc.], but you need to analyze at least five (5) scientific papers.


## Deliverables

:::medium
[You need to prepare and hold **a presentation** of about 20 to 30 minutes]{.fragment .fade-in} [and to **discuss your insights** in a Q&A.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

::: incremental
- Upload your presentation slides (.pptx and .pdf) via Moodle until the deadline
- Use following naming scheme: `FTM_ST24_Surname-Name`
- You will present the slides uploaded to Moodle (no late updates)
- For the deadline and the presentation dates, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)

# Grading

:::html-hidden
:::medium
[The **presentation** of your findings [(20-30 min., 70%)]{.light-grey}]{.fragment .fade-in}     
[+ the **discussion** [(~ 15 min., 20%)]{.light-grey}]{.fragment .fade-in}     
[+ your **contributions** to other presentations [(10%)]{.light-grey}.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::notes
The grade will be a combination of

- your **presentation** of your findings     
  *(20-30 minutes, 70% of your grade),*
- the **discussion** after the presentation      
  *(approx. 15 minutes, 20% of your grade),*
- and your **contributions to the discussion of your fellow students' presentations**   
  *(10% of your grade).*

## Evaluation criteria {.srollable}

An **excellent presentation** has the following characteristics.

. . .

#### Depth of research (30%) 

:::incremental
- Clearly defines the chosen future technology
- Accurately describes the technology's key characteristics based on course material
- Identifies and explores a variety of potential fields of application
- Thoroughly analyzes how the technology could benefit/transform these fields
- Discusses potential risks associated with the use of the technology
:::

-----

#### Social and ethical considerations (20%)

:::incremental
- Identifies and explores relevant social and ethical implications of the technology
- Demonstrates critical thinking in considering potential solutions or mitigations for negative impacts
:::

:::fragment

#### Scientific references (10%)

:::incremental
- Integrates research from at least five (5) scientific papers
- Accurately cites and references all sources
:::

:::

-----

#### Presentation (10%)

:::incremental
- Presentation is well-organized and easy to follow
- Information is presented clearly and concisely
- Effective use of visuals (e.g., slides, images, diagrams) to enhance understanding
- Visual aids are professional and visually appealing
- Speaks confidently and professionally
- Maintains eye contact and engages the audience
:::

-----

#### Discussion (20%)

And excellent discussion has the following characteristics.

:::incremental
- Demonstrates a clear understanding of the presented technology
- Accurately answers questions related to the presentation
- Answers questions in a professional and respectful manner
- Uses clear and concise language
- Extends on the information presented by demonstrating deeper understanding of the field
::::

----

#### Contributions to other presentations (10%)

:::fragment

The remaining 10% of the grade depents on how you engage in the discussion of other presentations.

:::incremental
- Points are given for each **thoughtful question or comment**^[The question needs to go beyond basic clarification and need to how deeper understanding; the question or comment encourages further discussion or analysis] you make during the Q&A of other presentations
- Additional points are given for the best question per presentation
:::

# Scientific literature

In your presentation, you need to consider at least **five scientific papers**.

::: incremental
- Select only papers that are peer-reviewed
- Recommendation is to focus the search on high-quality IS journals, such as
  - [Senior Scholarsâ€™ Basket of Journals](https://aisnet.org/page/SeniorScholarListofPremierJournals)
  - A-ranked or B-ranked journals in the [VHB-JOURQUAL3 ranking](https://vhbonline.org/fileadmin/user_upload/JQ3_WI.pdf)
- Use [Web of Science](https://www-webofscience-com.ezproxy.hnu.de/wos/woscc/basic-search), [Google Scholar](http://ezproxy.hnu.de/login?url=https://scholar.google.de) or the journalsâ€™ archives to search for literature
- Use the citation count as primary quality indicator (rule of thumb: the more cited, the more significant is the paper).
- Look for literature reviews that summarize the current state of knowledge.
