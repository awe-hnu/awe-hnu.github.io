# Learning Goals

After this lecture you should have an enhanced understanding of

:::incremental
- what emerging technologies are and what key attributes define them,
- how AI is linked to emerging technologies,
- what the concept orange economy is,
- how it is linked to emerging technologies, and
- why emerging technologies (particularly AI) call for trust and safety engineering.

# Emerging technologies {.vertical-center background-color="#1f6998"}

## More than just future

The term *future technology* refers to technology that currently exists only as a concept or in the very early stages of development. It's what we imagine might be possible in the years or decades to come.

. . .

:::medium
In this lecture, we focus on **emerging technologies**.
:::

. . .

Technologies that are already under development or in their early stages of adoption [**and** have to potential to significantly alter the status quo.]{.fragment .fade-in}

## Hype Cycle

:::notes
Everyone knows the Gartners Hype Cycle but do you know what exactly emerging technologies are?
:::

## Working hypothesis

:::large
[Emergent technologies are *new* technologies]{.fragment .fade-in}
[that spark large scale societal change]{.fragment .fade-in}
[and that open up completely new paths in certain fields.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

:::notes
But what does emergence actually mean?
:::

## Emergence

> Emergence refers to “the process of coming into being or of becoming important and prominent” [@stevenson2010oxford]

:::fragment

Other definitions:

:::incremental
- “to rise up or come forth […] to become evident […] to come into existence” [@houghton2005american]
- “the process of coming into being, or of becoming important and prominent” [@2004merriam]

## Discussion {.discussion-slide .html-hidden .unlisted .vertical-center background-color=black}

:::large
What characterizes emerging technology?
:::

## Characteristics

@rotolo2015emerging outlines five attributes that classify emerging technologies and differentiate them from other technologies:

:::medium
:::incremental
1. Radical novelty    
2. Relatively fast growth    
3. Coherence    
4. Prominent impact    
5. Uncertainty and ambiguity    
:::
:::

## Radical novelity

:::{.large .link-color}
Not there before or not used before in a given context.
:::

. . .

Radical novel technologies

:::incremental
- fulfill a given function by using a different basic principle as compared to what was used before to achieve the same or a similar function [@rotolo2015emerging] or
- transfer existing technologies from one domain to another, so they introduce existing technologies to new contexts [@devezas2005evolutionary]
:::

## Relatively fast growth

:::{.large .link-color}
Expansion rate exceeds that of established technologies.
:::

. . .

Emerging technologies show relatively fast growth rates compared to other technologies [@rotolo2015emerging], e.g. manifested in

:::incremental
- the amount of funding from public and private sources,
- the volume of knowledge output, and
- number of newly developed prototypes, products and services.
:::

## Coherence

:::{.large .link-color}
Emerging technologies have acquired a certain identity.
:::

. . .

Coherence fuels expansion and application [@rotolo2015emerging] and is, for instance, signaled by

:::incremental
- terminological maturity^[Terminological maturity is manifested e.g., in standardization of technical terms, abbreviations, acronyms],
- emerging scientific communication, and
- existing of expert communities.
:::

## Prominent impact

:::{.large .link-color}
Emerging technologies *can* completely change work, life and society.
:::

. . .

Emerging technologies exert a prominent impact on the socio-economic system by 

:::incremental
- changing the composition of actors, institutions, patterns of interactions among those, 
- and the associated (knowledge) production processes [@rotolo2015emerging].
:::

. . .

They impact a wide range of sectors, give rise to entirely new industries, or fundamentally change existing industries [@hung2006stimulating].

## Uncertainty and ambiguity

:::{.large .link-color}
We are not sure exactly what will happen.
:::

. . .

Emerging technologies are characterized by uncertainty in their possible outcomes and uses as well as by ambiguity in the meanings the will be ascribed to the technology [@rotolo2015emerging].

:::incremental
- The types of use can be intended or unintended 
- The outcomes can be desired or undesired
- Social groups will associate different meanings with the technology
- There is only incomplete knowledge possible outcomes of emergence
:::

## Definition

An **emerging technology** "is a [radically novel]{.link-color} and [relatively fast growing]{.link-color} technology characterized by a [certain degree of coherence persisting over time]{.link-color} and with the [potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio economic domain(s)]{.link-color} which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase [is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous]{.link-color}" [@rotolo2015emerging, p. 1828].

Do the key attributes of emergence change over time?
:::

## Different stages of emergence

:::notes

The same technology at a certain stage of emergence will most likely show a different level for the key attributes.
