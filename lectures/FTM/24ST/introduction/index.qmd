# Emerging technologies {.headline-only .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## More than just future

The term *future technology* refers to technology that currently exists only as a concept or in the very early stages of development. It's what we imagine might be possible in the years or decades to come.

. . .

:::medium
In this lecture, we focus on **emerging technologies**.
:::

. . .

Technologies that are already under development or in their early stages of adoption [**and** have to potential to significantly alter the status quo.]{.fragment .fade-in}

## Hype Cycle

:::notes
But what does emergence actually mean?
:::

## Emergence

Emergence refers to "the process of coming into being or of becoming important and prominent" [@stevenson2010oxford].

:::fragment

Other definitions:

:::incremental
- “to rise up or come forth […] to become evident […] to come into existence” [@houghton2005american]
- “the process of coming into being, or of becoming important and prominent” [@2004merriam]

## Discussion {.discussion-slide .html-hidden .unlisted .vertical-center background-color=black}

:::large
What characterizes emerging technology?
:::

## Characteristics

@rotolo2015emerging outlines five attributes that classify emerging technologies and differentiate them from other technologies:

:::medium
:::incremental
1. Radical novelty    
2. Relatively fast growth    
3. Coherence    
4. Prominent impact    
5. Uncertainty and ambiguity    
:::
:::

## Radical novelity

:::{.large .link-color}
Not there before or not used before in a given context.
:::

. . .

Radical novel technologies

:::incremental
- fulfill a given function by using a different basic principle as compared to what was used before to achieve the same or a similar function [@rotolo2015emerging] or
- transfer existing technologies from one domain to another, so they introduce existing technologies to new contexts [@devezas2005evolutionary]
:::

## Relatively fast growth

:::{.large .link-color}
Expansion rate exceeds that of established technologies.
:::

. . .

Emerging technologies show relatively fast growth rates compared to other technologies [@rotolo2015emerging], e.g. manifested in

:::incremental
- the amount of funding from public and private sources,
- the volume of knowledge output, and
- number of newly developed prototypes, products and services.
:::

## Coherence

:::{.large .link-color}
Emerging technologies have acquired a certain identity.
:::

. . .

Coherence fuels expansion and application [@rotolo2015emerging] and is, for instance, signaled by

:::incremental
- terminological maturity^[Terminological maturity is manifested e.g., in standardization of technical terms, abbreviations, acronyms],
- emerging scientific communication, and
- existing of expert communities.
:::

## Prominent impact

:::{.large .link-color}
Emerging technologies *can* completely change work, life and society.
:::

. . .

Emerging technologies exert a prominent impact on the socio-economic system by 

:::incremental
- changing the composition of actors, institutions, patterns of interactions among those, 
- and the associated (knowledge) production processes [@rotolo2015emerging].
:::

. . .

They impact a wide range of sectors, give rise to entirely new industries, or fundamentally change existing industries [@hung2006stimulating].

## Uncertainty and ambiguity

:::{.large .link-color}
We are not sure exactly what will happen.
:::

. . .

Emerging technologies are characterized by uncertainty in their possible outcomes and uses as well as by ambiguity in the meanings the will be ascribed to the technology [@rotolo2015emerging].

:::incremental
- The types of use can be intended or unintended 
- The outcomes can be desired or undesired
- Social groups will associate different meanings with the technology
- There is only incomplete knowledge possible outcomes of emergence
:::

## Definition

An **emerging technology** "is a [radically novel]{.link-color} and [relatively fast growing]{.link-color} technology characterized by a [certain degree of coherence persisting over time]{.link-color} and with the [potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio economic domain(s)]{.link-color} which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase [is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous]{.link-color}" [@rotolo2015emerging, p. 1828].

## Indications of emergence

::: notes
Will the fictions become reality? We will see. In any case, the intellectual frontiers of AI are wide open. The subfields span from artificial general intelligence (learning, reasoning, perception, etc.) to specific fields (e.g., translating, playing go) [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA].

## But what is AI?

:::medium
Artificial Intelligence refers to intelligence demonstrated by machines as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals  [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA]{.smaller}.
:::

:::fragment
AI is the science[^AIscience] of making machines to 
:::

:::incremental
- __think__ *(though processes and reasoning)* humanly and/or rationally 
- and to __act__ *(behavior)* humanly and/or rationally [@RusselNorvig2022AIMA]
:::

[^AIscience]: From a scientific perspective, AI aims to understand the principles that enable intelligent behavior in natural or artificial systems. From an engineering perspective, AI aims to design and synthesize useful, intelligent artefacts [@poole2010artificial].

## Generative AI

:::medium
> The term generative AI refers to computational techniques that are capable of generating seemingly new, meaningful content such as text, images, or audio from training data. *@feuerriegel2024generative [p. 111]* 
:::

. . .

Generative AI can be thought of as a machine-learning model that is trained to create new data, rather than making a prediction about a specific dataset. A generative AI system is one that learns to generate more objects that look like the data it was trained on.

# Trust and safety {.headline-only .vertical-center background-color="#0333ff"}

## Introduction

The concept **trust and safety** (T&S) refers to the policies, practices, products and teams dedicated to ensuring that users can trust and feel safe while using a (digital) service or participating in an online community [@o2012trust].

:::medium
Emerging technologies such as generative AI are powerful, but often pose particular challenges for trust and security. 
:::

## Impacts of GenAI

:::medium
[Deepfakes and misinformation, ]{.fragment}  
[increased difficulties in content moderation, ]{.fragment} 
[privacy risks, ]{.fragment} 
[enforced discrimination, ]{.fragment} 
[malicious applications, etc.]{.fragment} 
:::

:::notes

Deepfakes and misinformation
: Generative AI excels at creating realistic but synthetic data, like  images, videos, and even audio. This can be misused to create deepfakes that erode trust in real information and people. Malicious actors can use them to spread misinformation, impersonate others, or damage reputations.

Difficulty in content moderation
: The dynamic and evolving nature of generative AI makes it challenging for traditional content moderation tools and techniques to detect and remove problematic content. Generative AI can use novel language and techniques to bypass detection.

Enforced discrimination
:  Generative AI models are trained on massive datasets. Biases within this data can be amplified by the model, leading to discriminatory or offensive outputs. Imagine a model trained on news articles with sexist language, it might perpetuate these biases when generating its own text.

Privacy risks
: Generative AI models require large datasets to train, which can raise privacy concerns around the collection and use of personal data. Trust and safety teams need to ensure responsible data practices.

Malicious applications
:  Generative AI can be a tool for fraudsters.  AI-generated content can be used to create fake social media profiles, doctor financial documents, or impersonate real people for phishing attacks.
:::

## Exercise {.html-hidden .unlisted .vertical-center background-color=black}

What are relevant trust and safety risks that might be facilitated by GenAI?

:::notes

User Safety

- Suicide & Self Harm (e.g., intention to self harm, encouraging self harm, instructions)
- Harassment & Bullying (e.g., hateful conduct, dogpiling, blackmail threats, doxxing)
- Dangerous Misinformation & Endangerment (e.g., conspiracy theories, false safety info, dangerous challenges)

Scaled Abuse

- Spam (e.g., mass unsolicited messaging, auto-generated comments)
- Malware (e.g., viruses, spyware, ransomware)
- Inauthentic Behavior (e.g., fake engagement, disinformation campaigns)

Deceptive & Fraudulent Behavior

- Fraud (e.g., loan scams, pyramid schemes, fake charity solicitation, stolen goods)
- Impersonation (e.g., hacked accounts, fake names, impersonating celebrities)
- Cybersecurity (e.g., phishing, sharing/requesting login details)
- Intellectual Property (e.g., unauthorized use of trademarks/copyrighted content)
- Defamation (e.g., publication of false or outdated damaging statements)
