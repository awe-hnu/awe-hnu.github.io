## Multimodality — definition {.no-headline .vertical-center}

:::xlarge
[Multi]{.fragment fragment-index=1}[modality]{.link-color .fragment fragment-index=2}
:::

[Using more than one ]{.fragment fragment-index=1} [mode of communication to create meaning.]{.link-color .fragment fragment-index=2}

. . .

Multimodality emphasizes the importance of multiple modes (e.g., verbal, visual, spatial) to form overall understanding of a message.

:::notes
Improved accuracy and robustness
: Multimodal systems can enhance accuracy and robustness by integrating multiple modalities, such as speech, gesture, and touch, which can compensate for limitations in individual modalities.

Enhanced bandwidth
: By utilizing multiple modalities simultaneously, multimodal systems can provide users with a higher bandwidth of interaction, allowing for more efficient communication and interaction.

Flexibility and user preference
: Multimodal systems offer users the flexibility to choose the most convenient modality for interaction based on their preferences, abilities, and the context of the task.

Naturalness and ease of use
: Integrating multiple modalities can make interaction with technology more natural and intuitive, mimicking the way humans naturally communicate and interact with each other.

Redundancy and error correction
: Multiple modalities provide redundancy in input, allowing for error detection and correction. For example, if one modality fails or is misunderstood, other modalities can provide additional context or clarification.

Accessibility
: Multimodal systems can improve accessibility for users with diverse abilities and preferences by offering multiple modes of interaction that cater to different needs and capabilities.

Support for complex tasks
: Combining multiple modalities can support complex tasks that require different types of input or involve multiple steps, allowing users to interact with technology in a more efficient and effective manner.

# Immersiveness {.headline-only background-color="#0333ff"}

## Homework {background-color="#f4f4f4"}

Form small groups and synthesize your findings from reading @suh2018state by findings answers to following questions:

1. How can immersive technology be defined?
2. What are examples of immersive technology provided in the paper?
3. What technological features are key to enhancing user experience in immersive environments?
4. How does immersiveness relate to multimodality?
4. What fields of application are revealed in the paper?

Take 20 minutes to synthesize your findings and to create a short presentation.

## Immersion

:::medium
Immersion refers to the state of [being deeply engaged, absorbed, or submerged in an environment]{.link-color}, either physically or mentally.
:::

. . .

Immersion implies that the consciousness of the immersed person is detached from their physical self. Immersiveness is the quality or degree of being immersive.

## Immersion in games {background-color="#000" background-image="images/immersion.jpg"}


:::aside
:::medium
From **engagement** (e.g.: invest time, effort , and attention in the game) to\
**engrossment** (e.g. invest a high level of emotion in the game) to\
total **immersion** (e.g.fully present and empathize with the game) [@Sunyaev2020IC].

## Immersive technology

:::medium
Immersive technology [blurs the line between the physical, virtual, and simulated worlds]{.link-color}, thereby creating a sense of immersion.
:::

. . .

Technology has different abilities to create a sense of presence and engagement in the user.

:::aside
@lee2013presence, @handa2012immersive
:::

## Mechanisms

:::medium
The feeling of immersion is created by **temporarily altering a person's sense of presence** by tricking their cognitive and perceptual systems into believing they are in a place other than their actual physical location. 
:::

## Stimuly

Important stimuli that determine the immersiveness of environments created by  technology are

:::medium
[Visual stimuly, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[auditory stimuly, ]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[tactile stimuli,]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[olfactory stimuly, and]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
[interactive stimuly.]{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out} 
:::

. . .

In order to create these, technology needs **visual display** with hihg representational fidelity and media, **auditory and haptic interfaces** and the capability to **track movements**.

## Augmented reality (AR)

:::{.fragment fragment-index=1}
:::medium
Augmented reality refers to the [combination of a real scene]{.link-color} viewed by a user [with a virtual scene]{.link-color} that augments the scene with additional information.
:::
:::

:::{.fragment fragment-index=2}
[AR technology]{.link-color} superimposes virtual objects onto a live view of physical environments, helping users visualize how these objects fit into their physical world.
:::

:::aside 
:::{.fragment fragment-index=2}
@milgram1994taxonomy
:::
:::

## Hardware components

AR technologies require following hardware components:

:::incremental
1. Devices for displaying the virtual objects
2. Input devices to detect users’ interaction with the real and virtual object
3. Sensors to capture users’ positions and movements
4. Computing devices that combine the input data and create the virtual overlays
:::

. . .

Advancements in mobile computing and telecommunications infrastructures (will) increase the mobility and, thus, usability of these devices significantly.
