# Task

You need to **analyse an emerging digital technology**, its characteristics, use and implications.

. . .

You can make proposals on the topic you want to work for (deadline see [schedule](../admin/#schedule)). However, the final assignment will be made by me.

. . .

You need to do present

::: incremental
- the characteristics of the technology (i.e., based on the characteristics discussed in lecture), 
- fields of applications,
- the potential of the technology to transform these (benefits and risks),
- as well as social and ethical implications.
:::

. . .

You can include grey literature^[Grey literature includes usually not peer-reviewed material such as white papers, books, web-sources, etc.], but you need to analyze at least five (5) scientific papers.


## Deliverables

:::medium
[You need to prepare and hold **a presentation**]{.fragment .fade-in} [and to **ask and answer (tough) questions** in a Q&A.]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::

::: incremental
- Upload your presentation slides (.pptx and .pdf) via Moodle until the deadline
- Use following naming scheme: `FTM_ST26_Surname-Name`
- You will present the slides uploaded to Moodle (no late updates)
- For the deadline and the presentation dates, please see the [schedule](../admin/#schedule)
:::

## Hypothesis Challenger

For each presentation, one student will be assigned as **Hypothesis Challenger** immediately before the presentation begins.

:::fragment
As Hypothesis Challenger, you must develop a question **during the presentation** that critically examines or extends the presenter's connection to the hypotheses discussed in class. Your question should demonstrate your understanding of both the lecture content and the presentation.
:::

:::fragment
Your question should go beyond simply asking about the hypothesis connection (which the presenter should have already established). Instead, aim for one of these approaches:
:::

:::incremental
- Question where the presenter's argument reaches its limits
- Link the presented hypothesis connection to (another) hypothesis
- Propose scenarios that would challenge the presenter's thesis
- Ask for clarification using specific terminology from the lecture
:::

:::notes
*Example-Question: You argue that Brain-Computer-Interface enables immersive experiences. However, considering Milgram & Kishino's virtuality continuum and the role of tactile stimuli discussed in class – where exactly would you place current BCI technology, and what sensory limitations prevent deeper immersion?*

# Grading

:::html-hidden
:::medium
[The **presentation** of your findings\ [(8-10 min., 40%)]{.light-grey}]{.fragment .fade-in}     
[+ the **discussion**\ [(~ 10 min., 40%)]{.light-grey}]{.fragment .fade-in}     
[+ your **question** for another presentation\ [(20%)]{.light-grey}]{.fragment .fade-in}
:::
:::


:::notes
The grade will be a combination of

- your **presentation** of your findings (8–10 minutes, 40% of your grade)
- the ***discussion** after the presentation (approx. 10 minutes, 40% of your grade)
- your **Hypothesis Challenger question** for another presentation (20% of your grade)

## Evaluation criteria {.srollable}

Your presentation must meet the requirements of good scientific practice (passing criteria).

An **excellent presentation** has the following characteristics:

. . .

[Technology]{.h4}

- Clearly defines the chosen emerging technology based on the concepts
- Accurately describes the technology's key characteristics based on and extending the hypotheses discussed in class

. . .

[Fields of application]{.h4}

- Identifies and explores a variety of potential fields of application
- Thoroughly analyzes how the technology could benefit/transform these fields based on concepts discussed in class

-----

[Social and ethical considerations]{.h4}

- Identifies and explores relevant social and ethical implications of the technology
- Demonstrates critical thinking in considering solutions or mitigations for negative impacts

. . .

[Scientific references]{.h4}

- Integrates research from at least five (5) scientific papers
- Accurately cites and references all sources (passing criteria)

. . .

[Presentation]{.h4}

- Presentation is well-organized and easy to follow
- Speaks confidently and professionally

----

[Discussion]{.h4}

And **excellent discussion** has the following characteristics:

- Demonstrates a clear understanding of the presented technology
- Accurately answers questions related to the presentation and lecture contents
- Correctly uses terminology and concepts from the lecture
- Extends on the information presented by demonstrating deeper understanding of the field

. . .

[Hypothesis Challenger]{.h4}

And **excellent Hypothesis Challenger** question has the following characteristics:

- Correct use of terminology and concepts from the lecture
- Has specific reference to the presentation content (not a generic question)
- The question challenges, extends, or differentiates (demonstrating independent thinking)

## A note on grades

:::notes
It is unlikely that every student will receive a very good grade, i.e. deliver an outstanding performance - see the meaning of grades.  Instead, it is to be expected that the grades will spread across the spectrum. 
:::

| Grade                   | Meaning
|-------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` — very   good       | [A   truly outstanding achievement that (not only) shows no deficiencies in the criteria mentioned, but also gives both the supervisor and external assessors an excellent   impression.]{.fragment} |
| `2` — good              | [Work   that exceeds the average requirements/performance and is easily recognizable   and presentable to the outside world as a “good performance”.]{.fragment}                                              |
| *Note*                  | *2.5   is the average of passed assessments, i.e., an “average   performance”*                                                                                             |
| `3` — satisfactory      | [A   performance that achieves the desired goal "to a satisfactory   extent";       however, deficiencies can be identified here and there. ]{.fragment}                                                      |
| `4` — sufficient        | [A   performance that “still adequately satisfies” the requirements,       but deviates from the expectations placed on it in several ways.  ]{.fragment}                                                     |
| `5` — not   sufficient  | [A   performance that does not meet several of the criteria mentioned.]{.fragment}                                                                                                                                  |
# Scientific literature

In your presentation, you need to consider at least **five scientific papers**.

::: incremental
- Select only papers that are peer-reviewed.
- Recommendation is to focus the search on high-quality IS journals^[For a more balanced discussion of quality indicators of papers see e.g., @fitzgerald2019information], such as [Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals](https://aisnet.org/page/SeniorScholarListofPremierJournals) and/or A-ranked or B-ranked journals in the [VHB-JOURQUAL3 ranking](https://vhbonline.org/fileadmin/user_upload/JQ3_WI.pdf)
- Use [Web of Science](https://www-webofscience-com.ezproxy.hnu.de/wos/woscc/basic-search), [Google Scholar](http://ezproxy.hnu.de/login?url=https://scholar.google.de) or the journals’ archives to search for literature
- Use the citation count as primary quality indicator (rule of thumb: the more cited, the more significant is the paper).
- Look for literature reviews that summarize the current state of knowledge.
