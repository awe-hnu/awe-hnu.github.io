## Characteristics of emerging technologies

@rotolo2015emerging outlines five attributes that classify emerging technologies and differentiate them from other technologies:

:::fragment
:::medium
1. Radical novelty    
2. Relatively fast growth    
3. Coherence    
4. Prominent impact    
5. Uncertainty and ambiguity    
:::

## Stages of emergence

![Pre-emergence, emergence, and post-emergence: attributes and ‘stylised’trends. [@rotolo2015emerging, p. 1833]](../introduction/images/emergence.svg){height="420"}

## Interconnectedness

:::medium
Interconnectedness refers to a [formal linkage between two different systems]{.link-color}. 
:::

. . .

Computer networks reflect a collection of computers and devices connected so that they can [share information and services]{.link-color}. They, thus, are the clue of (interconnected) [information systems.]{.fragment}

[[networking infrastructure]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index=1}, ]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=1}
[[connectivity capabilities]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index=2}, and]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=2}
[[interoperability]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue fragment-index=3} (e.g. through standardization).]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=3}
:::

. . .

Examples of emergent technologies driving interconnected systems are\
[5G and IoT ecosystems (e.g., Matter smart homes)]{.fragment} 
[and cloud-native microservices architectures (e.g., containers and orchestration platforms)]{.fragment}

## Distributed systems

:::medium
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single coherent system.
:::

. . .

The independent computers, also known as nodes, communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages as they do not share a common memory.

# Ubiquity {.headline-only}

## Definition

:::fragment
:::medium
Ubiquitous computing [integrates computation into the environment]{.link-color}, rather than having computers which are distinct objects.
:::
:::

## Characteristics

Ubiquitous computing (UC), also known as ubicomp, is characterized by several key features that differentiate it from traditional computing:

:::medium
[[Invisibility]{.link-color},]{.fragment}
[[context-awareness]{.link-color},]{.fragment}
[[connectivity]{.link-color},]{.fragment}
[and [situated and proactive interaction]{.link-color}.]{.fragment}
:::

:::aside
@weiser1994world, @norman1998invisible, @dey2001understanding, @satyanarayanan2001pervasive
:::

:::notes

Invisibility
:  Unlike a bulky desktop computer, ubiquitous computing aims to integrate technology seamlessly into our surroundings. Think smartwatches, voice assistants, or embedded sensors in clothing or furniture. The user interacts with the technology naturally, without being hindered by the physical device itself.

Context-awareness
:  Ubicomp systems gather data about the user's environment and situation. This allows for a more personalized and relevant user experience.  For example, a fitness tracker might suggest workout routines based on the time of day and your activity level.

Connectivity
:  Ubiquitous computing thrives on a network of interconnected devices. This network could include smartphones, wearables, sensors, and even appliances.  The seamless exchange of data between these devices allows for a more intelligent and responsive environment.

Proactive interaction
:  The ultimate vision of ubiquitous computing is for systems to not only react to user input but also anticipate their needs. Imagine a system that automatically adjusts lighting or temperature based on your preferences and the time of day.

From [mainframe]{.link-color .fragment fragment-index=1}\
[to [personal computer]{.link-color}]{.fragment fragment-index=2}\
[to [ubiquitous computing]{.link-color}.]{.fragment fragment-index=3}
:::

[Mainframe: one computer shared by many people]{.fragment fragment-index=1}

[Personal computer (PC): one computer, one person]{.fragment fragment-index=2}

[Ubiquitous computing (UC): lots of computers, used by individual users, partly shared]{.fragment fragment-index=3}


:::notes
Mainframe: Computers were a scarce resource run by experts behind closed doors.
PC: You have your computer, it contains your stuff, and you interact directly and deeply with it
:::

## UC systems

:::medium
Ubiquitous computing systems rely on [tiny computing]{.link-color} devices [which [vanish into the environment]{.link-color}^[They vanish into the environment due to miniaturization and new materials, for example]]{.fragment} [ and [adapt dynamically to it]{.link-color}.]{.fragment} 
:::

. . .

These tiny computers need to be...

:::incremental
- networked, distributed, and transparently **accessible**,
- **context-aware** to optimize their operation in the respective environment,
- capable of **acting autonomously**, without human intervention, and
- able to **manage a variety of dynamic activities** through intelligent decision-making.
:::

## UC vs. virtual reality

:::large
Ubiquitous computing is roughly the opposite of virtual reality.
:::

:::aside
Where virtual reality puts people inside a computer-generated world, ubiquitous computing forces the computer to live out here in the world with people.

## Context

:::medium
Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity.
:::

. . .

An entity is a person, place, or object that is [considered relevant to the interaction]{.link-color} between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves.

:::aside
@dey2001understanding
:::

## Context-aware computing 

:::medium
A system is context-aware if it uses context to provide [relevant information and/or services]{.link-color} to the user, where relevancy depends on the user’s task.
:::

Following contexts need to be considered: \
[user context]{.fragment .link-color}[, environmental context]{.fragment .link-color}[, social context]{.fragment .link-color}[, and [service context]{.link-color}.]{.fragment}

:::notes
**User Context**

User context refers to the information that describes an individual user and their current situation. This information helps the system tailor its behavior to the user's needs and preferences. Here are some key aspects of user context:

- Identity: Who the user is, their role, and their preferences. For example, a learning platform might recommend different courses based on the user's educational background and interests.
- Location: Knowing the user's location allows for context-aware services like suggesting nearby restaurants or providing personalized traffic updates for navigation.
- Activity: Understanding the user's current activity, such as working, exercising, or sleeping, enables the system to adapt its behavior. For instance, a fitness tracker might suggest workout routines based on the user's activity level or a smart assistant might prioritize work-related notifications during office hours.
- Time: The time of day can be relevant context. Smart lights might adjust based on the time or a calendar app might remind you of upcoming events.

**Environmental context**

Environmental context refers to the physical surroundings where the user interacts with the system.  Sensors and other data sources can provide information about the environment to create a more responsive experience. Here are some examples of environmental context:

- Temperature: Sensors can detect room temperature and adjust a smart thermostat accordingly.
- Lighting: Smart lighting systems can adapt brightness and color temperature based on the ambient light levels.
- Noise level: A smart speaker might adjust its volume based on the prevailing noise level in the environment.
- Proximity to other devices: Ubicomp systems can leverage the presence of other devices to provide context. For example, unlocking your phone might automatically unlock your smart door lock.

**Social context**

Social context refers to the social environment surrounding the user. This includes the presence of other users and their interactions. While still under development, Ubicomp systems are exploring ways to understand social cues to further personalize the experience. Here are some possibilities for social context:

- Presence of other users: A smart meeting room might adjust its settings (lighting, temperature) based on the number of people present.
- Social interactions: Smart devices might even be capable of understanding social cues like gestures or facial expressions in the future, potentially adjusting volume or suggesting activities based on the social mood.

**Service context**

Service context refers to the characteristics and capabilities of the services available in a particular environment. Here's how service-context works alongside other contexts:

- Understanding service capabilities:  Service-context focuses on what services are available, their functionalities, and any limitations.  For example, a navigation app might consider traffic information and available routes as part of the service-context when suggesting directions. It wouldn't recommend a route that requires a specific service (like a high-occupancy vehicle lane) if the user's car isn't eligible.
- Interaction with other contexts:   Service-context interacts with other contextual factors like user context and environmental context.  A smart assistant might consider the user's location (user context) and available delivery services (service-context) before suggesting restaurants for food delivery. Similarly, it might adjust its recommendations based on the time of day (user context) and peak service hours (service-context).
- Dynamic service selection:  Service-context allows Ubicomp systems to dynamically select and utilize the most appropriate service for a given situation.  Imagine a scenario where you need to print something. The system might consider available printers (environmental context) and their functionalities (service-context) like color printing or duplex printing. It would then choose the most suitable printer based on your document and the available services.
