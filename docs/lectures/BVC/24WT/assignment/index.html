<h1>General remarks</h1>
<p>The lecture will not be offered in winter term 2024/2025. Therefore, only the information on the repeat examination is provided here.</p>
<p>The exam is similar to that in summer term 2024 with two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You work on your own</li>
<li>You are not required to develop a MVP, but to propose a technical solution that would work.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to solve the challenge, you will</p>
<ul>
<li>gather information about the practical context of the business challenge,</li>
<li>research information about the topic (state of research and practice),</li>
<li>identify and understand stakeholders that are affected by the problem as well as their needs,</li>
<li>develop an innovative approach to tackle the problem,</li>
<li>detail technical details of your proposed solution,</li>
<li>create an implementation plan,</li>
<li>detail and reflect on the specific value creation mechanisms (e.g., considering privacy and traceability), and</li>
<li>discuss lessons learnt, contributions and practical recommendations for action.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="business-challenge" class="level1">
<h1>Business challenge</h1>
<p>It is important for (contemporary) organizations to know the knowledge and skills of their employees for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective use of resources: if an organization knows what skills and knowledge its employees have, it can target them and plan projects more efficiently.</li>
<li>Employee development: By understanding current skills, targeted training and development programs can be created to enhance employee competencies.</li>
<li>Innovation and competitive advantage: Employees with specific knowledge and skills can develop innovative solutions and help the organization stand out from the competition.</li>
<li>Employee satisfaction: When employees are deployed in areas where they can play to their strengths, their satisfaction and motivation increases.</li>
<li>Succession planning: Organizations can better plan which employees are suitable for future management positions if they know their skills and potential.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is difficult to gain a good understanding of the (evolving) knowledge and skills of employees. Often, organizations rely on the knowledge acquired in development programs and the views of superiors, which may be collected in a very structured way as part of talent programs. With the new possibilities offered by generative AI, companies could not only increase the productivity of their employees, but also get to know and use their specific knowledge and skills in a contextual and a more informal and continuous mode.</p>
<p>Your task is to recommend a solution that leverages the potential of LLMs to improve an organizationâ€™s ability to map, update and harness existing knowledge and skills.</p>
<section id="key-questions" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="key-questions">Key Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>How can LLMs be used to enhance the understanding of the skills and knowledge available in the organization?</li>
<li>How can knowledge of employees be gained in a natural and non-disrupting mode?</li>
<li>What techniques or approaches does your model employ to overcome challenges such as resistance to share knowledge and potential biases?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="goals-and-outcome" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="goals-and-outcome">Goals and outcome</h2>
<p>The goal is to find innovative solutions that help to design interactions with an LLM-powered system that allow the organizations to map and harness existing knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>For this purpose, a description of the solution including a proof-of-concept and a outline for further implementation is to be submitted.</p>
<section id="requirements" class="level3">
<h3 data-anchor-id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Technology</dt>
<dd>
The proposed solution should be a large language model (LLM) that can be integrated directly into the web browser. You can propose to utilize available resources, such as leveraging an existing (open source) LLM or building your own model.
</dd>
<dt>Willingness to use</dt>
<dd>
The proposed solution should enhance employees willingness to share their knowledge and skills and to track how it developed.
</dd>
<dt>Information aggregation</dt>
<dd>
The solution could focus on summarizing and aggregating information from existing sources, both internal and external. Think of using APIs such as the google search API and APIs of document management systems and other internal enterprise information systems.
</dd>
<dt>Privacy</dt>
<dd>
Show how the proposed solution meets data protection requirements and provide users with a secure and trusted environment.
