<p>The phrase conveys the idea that a company‚Äôs culture, which includes its shared values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can have a more substantial influence on the organization‚Äôs outcomes than its strategic plans or strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="drucker1988coming">(<a href="#ref-drucker1988coming" role="doc-biblioref">Drucker et al. 1988</a>)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An organization‚Äôs culture influences how employees behave, make decisions, and interact with one another</strong>. If a strategic plan contradicts cultural norms or values, employees are likely to prioritize cultural consistency over strategic alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Culture can either enable or constrain the execution of strategic initiatives.</strong> A supportive culture aligns with the strategy, fosters commitment, and drives performance. Conversely, a culture that resists change or lacks alignment can hinder even the most well-conceived strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Leaders play a crucial role in shaping and aligning culture with strategy.</strong> Effective leaders understand the culture‚Äôs impact and work to foster a culture that supports the strategic vision.</li>
<li><strong>Successful organizations integrate culture and strategy.</strong> They develop strategies that not only consider external market dynamics but also respect and leverage the existing culture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="david2016strategic">(<a href="#ref-david2016strategic" role="doc-biblioref">David and David 2016</a>)</span>: - Strategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive changes can take considerable time and effort - Political maneuvering consumes valuable time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some valuable employees - Political biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded in strategy choice decisions</p>

<section id="the-question-of-value" class="level4" data-visibility="hidden">
<h4 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-value">The question of value</h4>
<p>Resources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm‚Äôs ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Managers need to check if the firm‚Äôs resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats: - Managers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors - Managers should identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways</p>
</section>
<section id="the-question-of-rareness" class="level4" data-visibility="hidden">
<h4 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-rareness">The question of rareness</h4>
<p>Resources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them: - If a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, it forms a source of competitive parity - Resources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage</p>
</section>
<section id="the-question-of-imitability" class="level4" data-visibility="hidden">
<h4 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-imitability">The question of imitability</h4>
<p>Resources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it: - If a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage - If competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage - Imitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources</p>
</section>
<section id="the-question-of-organization" class="level4" data-visibility="hidden">
<h4 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-organization">The question of organization</h4>
<p>The organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities: - A firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage - The firm‚Äôs complementary resources ‚Äì formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies ‚Äì are relevant for a firm to realize competitive advantage - To create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation</p>

<section id="limits-to-competition" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="limits-to-competition">Limits to competition</h2>
<div class="notes">
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="peteraf1993cornerstones">Peteraf (<a href="#ref-peteraf1993cornerstones" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span> uses the terms <em>ex-post</em> and <em>ex-ante</em> to describe different types of limits to competition:</p>
<p><strong>Ex-post limits to competition</strong> are barriers that protect competitive advantage <em>after</em> it‚Äôs been established. They preserve the sustainability of rents (profits) by making it difficult for competitors to imitate or substitute resources and by preventing competitive forces from eroding the firm‚Äôs advantage. Examples are patents, complex social relationships, and causal ambiguity that make it hard for competitors to replicate a successful firm‚Äôs capabilities.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug. Ex-post limits include patents making it legally difficult for competitors to produce the same drug, proprietary knowledge about formulation and manufacturing, strong brand loyalty among consumers and healthcare providers, and rigorous regulatory approvals that competitors would need to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Ex-ante limits to competition</strong> refer to barriers that exist <em>before</em> a firm establishes a superior position. These limits ensure that costs don‚Äôt offset the potential benefits of a strategic position. They limit competition for a position before any firm has established it, prevent the costs of acquiring resources from consuming all future profits.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> A tech company acquiring a patent for groundbreaking technology. Ex-ante limits include information asymmetry (better information about patent value), first-mover advantage (acting quickly before others), and unique complementary assets that make the patent more valuable to them than to competitors.</p>
<p>Together, these limits ensure that firms can acquire resources at costs below their ultimate value (ex-ante) and maintain their competitive advantage once established (ex-post).</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="teece1997dynamic">Teece, Pisano, and Shuen (<a href="#ref-teece1997dynamic" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> concept of dynamic capabilities essentially says that what matters for business is corporate agility: the capacity to (1) sense and shape opportunities and threats, (2) seize opportunities, and (3) maintain competitiveness through enhancing, combining, protecting, and, when necessary, reconfiguring the business enterprise‚Äôs intangible and tangible assets.</p>
<p><strong>Sensing:</strong> Dynamic capabilities begin with the ability to sense changes in the external environment, such as shifts in customer preferences or emerging market trends. This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.</p>
<p><strong>Seizing:</strong> Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Reconfiguring:</strong> In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization‚Äôs structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation.</p>
<p>Dynamic capabilities reflect the evolutionary fitness of organizations, which describes how well an organization can adapt to its environment and maintain competitive advantage <span class="citation" data-cites="steininger2022dynamic">(<a href="#ref-steininger2022dynamic" role="doc-biblioref">Steininger et al. 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Apple Inc.&nbsp;provides a compelling illustration of dynamic capabilities in action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensing</strong>: Apple constantly monitors consumer trends, technological advancements, and shifts in the global market. They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.</li>
<li><strong>Seizing</strong>: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Reconfiguring</strong>: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple‚Äôs app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.</li>

<p><strong>IT as an enabler of dynamic capabilities:</strong> IT provides the tools and infrastructure necessary for developing dynamic capabilities. Advanced data analytics and cloud computing enable organizations to quickly process and analyze large volumes of data, facilitating better decision-making and faster responses to market changes.</p>
<p><strong>IT embedded in dynamic capabilities:</strong> IT is integrated into the very fabric of dynamic capabilities. IT systems are embedded in processes such as supply chain management and customer relationship management, enhancing the organization‚Äôs ability to sense and respond to changes.</p>
<p><strong>IT as an outcome of dynamic capabilities:</strong> Dynamic capabilities can lead to the development and enhancement of IT capabilities. An organization that excels in innovation may develop new IT solutions or improve existing ones as a result of its dynamic capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>IT as context:</strong> IT shapes the context within which dynamic capabilities are developed and deployed. The digital environment creates a context that necessitates the development of dynamic capabilities to remain competitive. Environmental uncertainty and industry conditions are critical contextual factors that shape how organizations develop and deploy their capabilities.</p>

<p>The environment reveals external opportunities and threats. The resource-based view emphasizes the significance of internal resources and capabilities in achieving competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities represent an organization‚Äôs ability to adapt and reconfigure its resource base over time.</p>
<p>When combined, these concepts offer a comprehensive framework for strategic management. The SWOT framework offers a starting point to develop and think through a strategy, particularly four types of strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SO strategies</strong> (strengths-opportunities ‚Äî matching): using a firm‚Äôs internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities</li>
<li><strong>WO strategies</strong> (weaknesses-opportunities ‚Äî conversion): improving internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities</li>
<li><strong>ST strategies</strong> (strengths-threats ‚Äî neutralization): using a firm‚Äôs strengths to avoid or reduce the impact of external threats</li>

<p>Steps in using the SWOT framework:</p>
<div class="incremental">
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>Perform an <em>external audit</em> to identify opportunities and threats</li>
<li>Perform an <em>internal audit</em> to identify strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Allocate internal and external factors in the matrix</li>
<li>Review whether allocation to (one) box is correct</li>
<li>Structure the points in each box (i.e.&nbsp;group under headline, structure in sub-levels)</li>
<li>Review potential relevance (and disregard as appropriate)</li>
<li>Test whether statement is true and quantify where possible</li>
<li>Review, prioritize</li>
<li>Develop strategies based on the analysis</li>
</ol>
