<p>Culture eats strategy for breakfast. <em>Peter Drucker, Management consultant, educator and author</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<p>The phrase conveys the idea that a company’s culture, which includes its shared values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can have a more substantial influence on the organization’s outcomes than its strategic plans or strategies. In other words, a well-crafted strategy may look excellent on paper, but if it doesn’t align with or is undermined by the prevailing organizational culture, it is less likely to succeed <span class="citation" data-cites="drucker1988coming">(<a href="#ref-drucker1988coming" role="doc-biblioref">Drucker et al. 1988</a>)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An organization’s culture influences how employees behave, make decisions, and interact with one another</strong>. If a strategic plan contradicts cultural norms or values, employees are likely to prioritize cultural consistency over strategic alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Culture can either enable or constrain the execution of strategic initiatives.</strong> A supportive culture aligns with the strategy, fosters commitment, and drives performance. Conversely, a culture that resists change or lacks alignment can hinder even the most well-conceived strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Leaders play a crucial role in shaping and aligning culture with strategy.</strong> Effective leaders understand the culture’s impact and work to foster a culture that supports the strategic vision.</li>
<li><strong>Successful organizations integrate culture and strategy.</strong> They develop strategies that not only consider external market dynamics but also respect and leverage the existing culture. Additionally, they may seek to evolve the culture to better support strategic goals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="david2016strategic">(<a href="#ref-david2016strategic" role="doc-biblioref">David and David 2016</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive changes can take considerable time and effort</li>
<li>Political maneuvering consumes valuable time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some valuable employees</li>
<li>Political biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded in strategy choice decisions</li>

<div class="notes">
<p>Understanding the sources of competitive advantages calls for an analysis of not only the company’s environment (opportunities and threats), but its own/internal strengths and weaknesses as well <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This point is clearly highlighted when we consider the success achieved by companies such as WalMart, Southwest Airlines and Nucor Steel, despite unfavorable environments.</p>
<p>A firm’s internal attributes – its resources and capabilities – include all the financial, physical, human and organisational assets used by a firm to develop, manufacture and deliver products/services to its customers.</p>
<p>Resources and capabilities that cannot be readily matched by competitors are referred to as <strong>distinctive competencies</strong>. To identify a company’s distinctive competencies, resources and capabilities must be evaluated by considering four important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The question of value.</li>
<li>The question of rareness.</li>
<li>The question of imitability.</li>
<li>The question of organisation.</li>
</ul>
<section id="the-question-of-value" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-value">The question of value</h2>
<p>Resources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm’s ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Managers need to check if the firm’s resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Managers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities.</li>
<li>Managers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not.</li>
<li>Managers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors.</li>
<li>Managers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-question-of-rareness" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-rareness">The question of rareness</h2>
<p>Resources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, i.e.&nbsp;it is valuable but common, then it forms a source of competitive parity.</li>
<li>Resources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-question-of-imitability" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-imitability">The question of imitability</h2>
<p>Resources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes or alternatives for the resource. In other words, competitors cannot easily find a different resource to replace or replicate the unique value of the resource or capability <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability identified as valuable and rare face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it, compared to firms that already possess it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.<br>
</li>
<li>If competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Imitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-question-of-organization" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-organization">The question of organization</h2>
<p>The organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the four VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization to maximize its impact. In addition, resources often work best when they are integrated with other resources and capabilities within the organization <span class="citation" data-cites="barney1995looking">(<a href="#ref-barney1995looking" role="doc-biblioref">Barney 1995</a>)</span>?</p>
<p>Thus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>A firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage arising from the value, rareness and imitability of its resources and capabilities.</li>
<li>The firm’s complementary resources – for example, its formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant/important for a firm to realize competitive advantage.</li>
<li>To create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation.</li>

<p>By developing dynamic capabilities, organizations can better navigate change and respond effectively to new challenges.

<p><strong>Sensing:</strong> Dynamic capabilities begin with the ability to sense changes in the external environment, such as shifts in customer preferences or emerging market trends. This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.</p>
<p><strong>Seizing:</strong> Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Reconfiguring:</strong> In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization’s structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation.</p>

<p>Apple Inc.&nbsp;provides a compelling illustration of dynamic capabilities in action. Over the years, Apple has demonstrated its ability to sense market changes, seize opportunities, and reconfigure its resources effectively, all of which are central elements of dynamic capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensing: Apple constantly monitors consumer trends, technological advancements, and shifts in the global market. They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.</li>
<li>Seizing: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.</li>
<li>Reconfiguring: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple’s app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple’s success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. This adaptability and innovation have enabled Apple to consistently deliver products and services that resonate with consumers worldwide.</p>

<p>The environment reveals external opportunities and threats. The resource-based view emphasizes the significance of internal resources and capabilities in achieving competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities represent an organization’s ability to adapt and reconfigure its resource base over time.</p>
<p>When combined, these concepts offer a comprehensive framework for strategic management. By combining these perspectives, the <strong>Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) framework</strong> offers a starting point to develop and think through a strategy, particularly four types of strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SO strategies</strong> (strengths-opportunities): using a firm’s internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities</li>
<li><strong>WO strategies</strong> (weaknesses-opportunities): improving internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities</li>
<li><strong>ST strategies</strong> (strengths-threats): using a firm’s strengths to avoid or reduce the impact of external threats</li>
<li><strong>WT strategies</strong> (weaknesses-threats): defensive tactics directed at reducing internal weakness and avoiding external threats</li>

<h1>Review and consolidation</h1>
<p>The following questions are designed to review and consolidate what you have learned and are a good starting point for preparing for the exam.</p>
<div class="smaller">
<ul>
<li>Why do you think the SWOT Matrix is the most widely used of all strategy matrices?</li>
<li>What other strategy matrices do you know? Name and explain one and compare it to the SWOT matrix.</li>
<li>Identify a strategy for the HNU that would exemplify the matching concept evidenced in SWOT analysis.</li>
<li>Think of limitations of the SWOT matrix and related analysis. Name three limitations and relate them to the concept of dynamic capabilities.</li>
<li>Perform a SWOT analysis for Spotify.</li>
<li>Do you agree or disagree with the resource-based view (RBV) theorists that internal resources are more important for a firm than external factors in achieving and sustaining competitive advantage? Explain your and their position.</li>
<li>What makes a resource valuable to a company?</li>
<li>Explain the concept of resource heterogeneity. Why is it considered a crucial factor in determining competitive advantage according to the RBV?</li>
<li>How does resource immobility relate to the sustainability of competitive advantage?</li>
<li>How do dynamic capabilities enable firms to adapt and innovate over time?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between a firm’s resources, competitive advantage, and value creation for customers?</li>
<li>How does the RBV contribute to our understanding of why some firms consistently outperform others in the marketplace?</li>

<li>How does Mintzberg propose to think of strategy formation instead?</li>
<li>Which patterns of strategy formation has Mintzberg identified? Can you provide examples of organizations that might employ each of these patterns?</li>
<li>Why and how can the <em>aggressive, proactive strategy-maker</em> as well as contingency planning be risky for organizations, particular in turbulent environments?</li>
<li>What practical implications can you draw from Mintzberg’s insights for organizations’ strategic management practices?</li>
