<h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
<p>After this session, you should have a solid understanding of</p>
<div class="incremental">
<ul class="incremental">
<li>different generic strategies as proposed by Ansoff, Porter and Mintzberg;</li>
<li>the competitive characteristics that define the strategy types and their applicability;</li>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="galbraith1983empirical">Galbraith, Craig, and Schendel (<a href="#ref-galbraith1983empirical" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span> developed a typology of strategy encompassing six generic strategies for consumer goods and four for industrial products based on empirical data. The typology reaffirms that distinct, consistent, and recurring patterns of strategic behavior exist.</p>
<section id="consumer-goods" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="consumer-goods">Consumer goods</h2>
<section id="harvest" class="level4">

<p>The Ansoff-matrix <span class="citation" data-cites="ansoff1965corporate">(<a href="#ref-ansoff1965corporate" role="doc-biblioref">Ansoff 1965</a>)</span> is a strategic planning framework that helps businesses figure out how to grow by looking at their current and potential markets and products. The matrix groups growth strategies based on two main factors: products (what they offer) and markets (who they serve), leading to four growth strategies, each with its own focus.</p>
<section id="strategies" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<section id="market-penetration" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="market-penetration">Market penetration</h4>
<p>Organisations with a market penetration strategy aim to increase market share and sales within existing markets with existing products. They focus on selling more of their current products or services to their current customer base. This often involves tactics like price adjustments, marketing campaigns, or enhancing customer loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Coca-Cola frequently uses market penetration strategies by increasing its marketing efforts and promotional activities to boost sales of existing products in existing markets. For instance, they often launch new advertising campaigns and seasonal promotions to increase consumption of their beverages.</p>
</section>
<section id="market-development" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="market-development">Market development</h4>
<p>Organizations pursuing market development strategy expand into new markets or customer segments with existing products. They seek to identify and enter new geographic regions or customer groups that haven‚Äôt been previously served. This could involve entering new countries, regions, or demographic segments.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Starbucks has been expanding into new geographic markets, particularly in Asia. By opening new stores in countries like China and India, Starbucks is applying a market development strategy to grow its customer base.</p>
</section>
<section id="product-development" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="product-development">Product development</h4>
<p>Organizations with a product development strategy create and introduce new products or services into existing markets.They focus aim to leverage their existing market knowledge and customer base to introduce new products or services. This may involve research and development efforts or acquisitions of technologies or innovations.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Apple consistently introduces new products to its existing markets. The launch of new versions of the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook are examples of product development strategies aimed at maintaining and growing its market share.</p>

<h4 data-anchor-id="diversification">Diversification</h4>
<p>Organizations with a diversification strategy enter entirely new markets with new products or services. Diversification strategies are the most ambitious and risky. Organizations seek growth by both creating new offerings and entering new markets that are unrelated to their current business. Diversification can be either related (limited connection to current products or markets) or unrelated (no connection).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Amazon has diversified significantly over the years. Beyond its core e-commerce business, Amazon has expanded into cloud computing with AWS, entertainment with Amazon Prime Video, and even grocery retail with the acquisition of Whole Foods.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="porter1980competitive">Porter (<a href="#ref-porter1980competitive" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> proposed three generic strategies that organizations can pursue to gain a competitive advantage in their respective industries. These strategies are based on the scope of the target market and the competitive advantage sought.</p>
<section id="strategies-1" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="strategies-1">Strategies</h2>
<section id="cost-leadership-strategy" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="cost-leadership-strategy">Cost leadership strategy</h4>
<p>This strategy focuses on becoming the lowest-cost producer in an industry, enabling a company to offer products or services at competitive prices while maintaining profitability. Companies achieve this through economies of scale, efficient operations, and cost-saving measures. The goal is to offer products at a lower price than competitors, attracting price-sensitive customers.</p>
<p>This strategy targets a broad market scope but comes with risks such as intense price competition and the potential need to sacrifice quality or innovation.</p>
</section>
<section id="differentiation-strategy" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="differentiation-strategy">Differentiation strategy</h4>
<p>This strategy involves offering unique products or services that offer distinct value to customers. Companies achieve differentiation through innovation, quality, branding, and customer service. The aim is to create products that are perceived as superior and can command a premium price.</p>
<p>Companies scope is broad, often they target the entire market. They focus on offerings that are appealing to customers, which are willing to pay more for differentiated products and services. However, sustaining differentiation requires ongoing investment and innovation.</p>
</section>
<section id="focus-strategy" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="focus-strategy">Focus strategy</h4>
<p>This strategy targets a specific market segment or niche. Companies using a focus strategy concentrate on serving the unique needs of a particular group of customers better than competitors. This can be achieved through either cost focus (offering lower prices within the niche) or differentiation focus (offering specialized products). Key aspects include market segmentation, specialization, and relationship building within the targeted segment.</p>
<p>While the focus strategy minimizes exposure to broader market risks, it also makes the company vulnerable to changes in the chosen market and potential competition from larger players.</p>

<section id="stuck-in-the-middle" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="stuck-in-the-middle">Stuck in the middle</h2>
<div class="notes">
<p>Being <strong>stuck in the middle</strong> refers to a situation where a company attempts to pursue multiple generic strategies simultaneously without excelling in any one of them. This term is often used to describe a lack of clear strategic focus or a failure to achieve a competitive advantage through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus.</p>
<p>Effective strategic management often involves making deliberate choices about which generic strategy to pursue and aligning the organization‚Äôs resources and activities accordingly. When a company tries to pursue multiple strategies without excelling in any of them, it may struggle to compete effectively in its industry.</p>

Trade-offs
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Trade-offs are necessary in order to secure a strategic position against activities that are incompatible. The essence of strategy is as much about choosing what not to do as choosing what to do <span class="citation" data-cites="mintzberg2014strategy">(<a href="#ref-mintzberg2014strategy" role="doc-biblioref">Mintzberg 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Trade-offs arise for three reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To avoid inconsistencies in image or reputation.</li>
<li>Different positions require different product configurations, equipment, skills, management systems, etc.</li>
<li>Due to limits on internal coordination and control.</li>
</ol>
<p>Positioning trade-offs are essential to strategy ‚Äì they create the need for choice, and purposefully limit what a company offers. They deter ‚Äòstraddling‚Äô and ‚Äòrepositioning‚Äô by competitors.</p>

<section id="integration" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="integration">Integration</h2>
<p>Porter‚Äôs three generic strategies‚Äîcost leadership, differentiation, and focus‚Äîcan be put into practice by forward integration, backward integration, and horizontal integration in the following ways:</p>
<section id="cost-leadership" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="cost-leadership">Cost Leadership</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backward integration:</strong> Companies aiming for cost leadership might acquire their suppliers to reduce costs and secure a stable supply of raw materials. For example, a car manufacturer might acquire a steel plant to lower the cost of steel.</li>
<li><strong>Forward integration:</strong> Firms might also acquire distribution channels to reduce costs associated with intermediaries. For instance, a manufacturer might open its own retail stores to sell directly to consumers, cutting out the middleman.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal integration:</strong> By merging with or acquiring competitors, companies can achieve economies of scale, reducing costs per unit. For example, a large supermarket chain might acquire smaller chains to increase its purchasing power and reduce costs.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="differentiation" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="differentiation">Differentiation:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backward integration:</strong> Companies might integrate backward to ensure the quality of their inputs, which supports their differentiation strategy. For example, a luxury car manufacturer might acquire a high-quality leather supplier to ensure the quality of its interiors.</li>
<li><strong>Forward integration:</strong> Firms might integrate forward to control the customer experience and enhance their brand. For instance, a high-end fashion brand might open its own boutiques to provide a unique shopping experience.</li>
<li>Horizontal integration: By acquiring companies with complementary products, firms can enhance their product offerings and differentiate themselves. For example, a tech company might acquire a software firm to integrate advanced features into its hardware products.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="focus" class="level4">
<h4 data-anchor-id="focus">Focus</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backward integration:</strong> Companies with a focus strategy might integrate backward to control specific inputs that are crucial for their niche market. For example, a specialty coffee shop might acquire a coffee plantation to ensure the quality and uniqueness of its beans.</li>
<li><strong>Forward integration:</strong> Firms might integrate forward to directly reach their niche market and provide tailored services. For instance, a gourmet food producer might open specialty stores to sell directly to food enthusiasts.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal integration:</strong> By acquiring other firms within their niche, companies can strengthen their market position and better serve their focused customer base. For example, a boutique fitness brand might acquire other specialized fitness studios to expand its offerings.</li>

<p>According to <span class="citation" data-cites="mintzberg1988generic">Mintzberg (<a href="#ref-mintzberg1988generic" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>)</span> families of strategies can be divided into five broad groups:</p>
</section>
<section id="locating-the-core-business" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="locating-the-core-business">Locating the core business</h2>
<p>Strategies that focus on identifying and concentrating on the core activities which define the organization‚Äôs essential business.</p>
<div class="notes">
<p>This strategy type involves a clear understanding of the core competencies and core products or services that the organization excels in. Resources are directed toward strengthening and emphasizing these core areas while potentially divesting from non-core activities.</p>
<p>To figure out what the company‚Äôs core competencies and products or services are, you can look at the industry network it‚Äôs in <span class="citation" data-cites="mintzberg1988generic">(<a href="#ref-mintzberg1988generic" role="doc-biblioref">Mintzberg 1988</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>upstream business</strong> the product flows in a number of different directions, from the basic material to a variety of uses. Upstream businesses tend to be tech and capital-intensive, rather than people-intensive. They‚Äôre more likely to look for advantage through low-cost than high margins, favoring sales push over market pull (e.g., Wieland producing copper semi-finished products). Essential elements are resource acquisition, technology and innovation, and cost management.</li>
<li><strong>Midstream businesses</strong> are at the heart of the process. The hourglass is a great metaphor for this. It shows how a variety of inputs are drawn into a single production process, which then flows out to a variety of users (e.g., Apple producing iPhones). Essential elements are supply chain coordination.</li>
<li>In the <strong>downstream business</strong> lots of different inputs come together in a narrow space (e.g., Mediamarkt selling lots of different electronic products). Essential elements are marketing and distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework can help companies better understand where they should focus their efforts and resources to strengthen their core business and achieve competitive advantage.</p>

<section id="distinguishing-the-core-business" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="distinguishing-the-core-business">Distinguishing the core business</h2>
<p>Strategies that focus on highlighting and differentiating the core business from competitors.</p>
<div class="notes">
<p>Organizations pursuing this strategy type work on creating unique selling propositions (USPs) for their core products or services. They aim to stand out in the market by emphasizing what makes their core offerings distinct and valuable to customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguishing the core business involves creating a clear distinction between what the organization does exceptionally well (its core) and what may be less critical or peripheral to its overall mission. Thus, companies need to <strong>identify what its core activities or competencies are</strong>. These are the fundamental processes, products, or services that define the essence of the organization and contribute significantly to its success.</li>
<li>Once the core activities are identified, the organization needs to <strong>allocates a significant portion of its resources to support and strengthen these core elements</strong>, such as talent, capital, and time. This focus ensures that the company excels in the areas that truly set it apart from competitors.</li>
<li>By emphasizing and differentiating the core business, the organization <strong>strategically positions itself as a leader or specialist in those core activities</strong>. This can help it compete more effectively, command premium prices, and build a strong brand reputation.</li>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Porter‚Äôs framework of generic strategies constitute strategies to distinguish the core business. <em>Cost leadership</em> and <em>differentiation</em> align with the idea of distinguishing the core business by focusing on specific strengths, whether in cost efficiency or unique features. <em>Focus strategy</em> aligns with both concepts as it involves concentrating resources and efforts on a specific market segment or niche, which essentially becomes the organization‚Äôs core customer base.</p>

<section id="noncustomers" class="level2" data-visibility="hidden">
<h2 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="noncustomers">Noncustomers</h2>
<p>Identifying and converting noncustomers (those who are not currently served by the industry) into customers is a key aspect of blue ocean strategy.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="kim2005blue">Kim and Mauborgne (<a href="#ref-kim2005blue" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> categorize noncustomers into three tiers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Soon-to-be noncustomers</dt>
<dd>
Soon-to-be noncustomers are individuals or entities that are not currently part of your customer base but are likely to become noncustomers in the near future if their needs or preferences are not addressed. These potential noncustomers are dissatisfied or frustrated with the existing offerings in the market. They might be experiencing unmet needs, inconveniences, or issues with current products or services.
</dd>
<dt>Refusing noncustomers</dt>
<dd>
Refusing noncustomers are individuals or entities that consciously choose not to engage with your industry or product category despite having alternatives available. These noncustomers have actively decided not to use the products or services within your industry due to reasons such as cost, inconvenience, or dissatisfaction with existing offerings. The goal with refusing noncustomers is to understand their objections or reasons for refusal and to find ways to eliminate those barriers or create offerings that align with their preferences. By doing so, organizations can convert refusing noncustomers into customers.
</dd>
<dt>Unexplored Noncustomers</dt>
<dd>
Unexplored noncustomers are individuals or entities who have never been considered as potential customers by your industry because they fall outside the traditional market boundaries. These noncustomers are often overlooked because they do not fit the typical customer profile or have unique needs that have not been addressed by existing products or services in the market. Identifying unexplored noncustomers opens up new market spaces. Organizations can tap into this untapped segment by innovating and creating products or services that cater specifically to the unmet needs and preferences of this group.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>By understanding the unique characteristics and motivations of each group, organizations can develop value propositions that resonate with these noncustomers and convert them into loyal customers, thus moving away from crowded ‚Äúred oceans‚Äù and into ‚Äúblue oceans‚Äù of opportunity.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Define and discuss vertical integration (<em>or another generic strategy</em>)</li>
<li>Give some guidelines when vertical integration (<em>or another generic strategy</em>) is an excellent strategy to pursue.</li>

<li>Discuss whether it is best for a small firm to grow internally (organically) or to grow externally using means such as partnerships, joint ventures or mergers and acquisitions.</li>
<li>Give reasons why so many companies are divesting (spinning off) key segments/divisions of the firm.</li>
<li>Explain the following statement: <em>Unlike with cost leadership where a firm examines how to reduce costs along its value chain, with differentiation one looks to maximize value along each level of the value chain.</em></li>
<li>Called de-integration, there appears to be a growing trend for firms to become less forward integrated. Discuss why.</li>
<li>What conditions, externally and internally, would be desired/necessary for a firm to diversify?</li>

<li>Why is it not advisable to pursue too many strategies at once?</li>
<li>There are cooperative and competitive strategies. What is the difference? What are advantages and disadvantages?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!--

De-integration makes sense in industries that have global distributors.
Companies today shop around, play one distributor against another, and go with the
best deal. Global competition is also spurring firms to reduce their number of suppliers
and to demand higher levels of service and quality from those they keep.
