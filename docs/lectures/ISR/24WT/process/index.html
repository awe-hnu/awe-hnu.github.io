<p>The process as depicted in <a href="#fig-journey" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a> looks very straight-forward. However, in reality the “construction” process of research is messy and characterized by trial and error, failure, risk-taking and serendipity, so it requires perseverance through many iterations of inductive, deductive and abductive reasoning, ideas and trials, testing and retesting. It took Thomas Edison 2,000 trials before he was successful with his first innovation. Research is, without exaggeration, a challenging task <span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">(<a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">Recker 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>A common piece of advice is “you should read before you write” <span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">(<a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">Recker 2021, 52</a>)</span>. There is a lot of truth to this advice. One of the most important tasks in your efforts to contribute to knowledge with your research is to acquire knowledge. You need to know the current body of knowledge in your field (which is codified in the literature) before you can even think about how to create new knowledge.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="types-of-knowledge" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="types-of-knowledge">Types of knowledge</h2>
<p>You need to acquire at least three types of knowledge <strong>before yo can even start your research</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">(<a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">Recker 2021</a>)</span>—knowledge about:</p>
<div class="large">
<p><span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">the domain and topic,</span> <span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">relevant theories and available evidence &amp;</span> <span class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">relevant research methods</span></p>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<ol type="1">
<li>the domain and topic of interest that relate to your chosen phenomena;</li>
<li>relevant theories and available evidence that help you frame questions and phenomena, and</li>
<li>relevant research methods that you can apply to develop new knowledge, build innovative artefacts, or articulate new questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing research demands that you spend a significant amount of time and effort to acquire and critically appraise this cumulative knowledge base, constantly, repeatedly, continuously <span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">(<a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">Recker 2021</a>)</span>. A firm understanding of the body of knowledge is essential to many of the decisions in early stages of your research. Particularly, the literature provides information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the extend, type, and nature of potential research problems;</li>
<li>gaps of knowledge about a particular phenomenon or question;</li>
<li>the extent to which current theories provide explanations or not;</li>
<li>which theories can be used to frame the investigation; and</li>
<li>strategies and methodologies used to research the phenomenon or similar phenomena.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<section id="read-interpret-write" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="read-interpret-write">Read-interpret-write</h2>
<p>When consuming scientific literature, it’s not always necessary or efficient to read every sentence from start to finish.</p>
<p>You can apply the <strong>read-interpret-write strategy</strong> to keep focused and make the most of your reading <span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">(adapted from read-think-interpret strategy in <a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">Recker 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<div class="incremental">
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li><strong>Read</strong> — before diving into the details, skim the title, abstract, introduction, headings, subheadings, and conclusion; then identify key sections that contribute to your objectives and read those piece by piece</li>
<li><strong>Interpret</strong> — think about the piece’s relevance for your research and evaluate whether there are useful ideas, theories, concept, methods, or findings you should investigate in more depth</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong> — Keep a (digital) notebook where you note down key takeaways, questions, and reflections.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>While reading, interpreting and writing, always keep your research goals in mind.</p>
<div class="notes">
<p>The following questions can guide you in the read-interpret-write process <span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">(<a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">Recker 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the <strong>central contribution of the material</strong> in terms of contemporary practice in your field of research?</li>
<li>How does it relate to other articles and practices?</li>
<li>Does the reading represent a theoretical or methodological perspective that might be useful in examining the phenomena that interest you? And why is this the case, or why not?</li>
<li>How might it inform your own thinking about the field?</li>
<li>How do you think the reading influenced the state of knowledge in the field at the time it was published?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional strategies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use highlighting or annotation:</strong> As you read, use highlighting, underlining, or digital annotation tools to mark key points, important concepts, and relevant citations. This can help you quickly locate and review important information later. Read Strategically: If you’re reading a longer paper, consider reading strategically by reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph. This can give you a sense of the main ideas without getting bogged down in every detail.</li>
<li><strong>Follow citations:</strong> If a paper references other works that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related resrks that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related research.</li>
<li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Reading complex material for extended periods can lead to reduced comprehension. Take short breaks to maintain focus and prevent fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize summaries:</strong> In addition to reading full papers, consider using summaries, reviews, or annotated bibliographies to get an overview of key concepts and findings before deciding whether to delve into the complete paper.</li>
</ul>

<section id="where-to-find-literature" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="where-to-find-literature">Where to find literature</h2>
<p>Build on the shoulder of giants—your research should build upon <strong>high quality readings</strong>, which are usually found in leading journals and conferences (especially recent topics).</p>
<div class="incremental">

<li>Journal and Conference Rankings for Information Systems/Management<br>
<span class="smaller"><a href="https://vhbonline.org/vhb4you/vhb-jourqual/vhb-jourqual-3">VHB JourQual 3</a>, <a href="https://aisnet.org/page/SeniorScholarListofPremierJournals">AIS Senior Scholars’ List of Premier Journals</a>, or <a href="https://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide-2021/">ABS Academic Journal Quality Guide</a></span></li>
<li>Also look in related fields (e.g., in management or psychology), particularly for theory literature<br>
<span class="smaller">E.g., scan recent publications in the journal/conferences of the <a href="https://aom.org/">Academy of Management (AOM)</a></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Initially, scan leading journal/conference; start with the most recent articles.</p>
<p>Later, adopt a structured approach, e.g., run structured queries against databases such as the the <a href="https://aisel-aisnet-org.ezproxy.hnu.de">AIS eLibrary</a> or <a href="https://www-webofscience-com.ezproxy.hnu.de/wos/woscc/basic-search">Web of Science</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Forward search</strong>—use a database (e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.de/">Google Scholar</a>) to identify articles citing the paper you are currently reading. This helps to uncover more recent articles that build upon the topic you are engaging with.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<section id="summaries" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="summaries">Summaries</h2>
<p>You might not be the first, so look for and utilize structured literature reviews:</p>
<div class="large">
<p>They contribute to the overall understanding of a subject area and highlight areas for your research.</p>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<p>Literature review articles are available to many topics/problem domains. Those papers examine and synthesize existing research on a specific topic to provide a clear and well-organized overview of the literature while identifying key themes, trends, gaps, and debates. They are an excellent starting point for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge within a particular field or subject area.</p>
<p>You can identify literature review by running a query against online databases (e.g., <a href="https://scholar.google.de/">Google Scholar</a>, <a href="https://aisel-aisnet-org.ezproxy.hnu.de/">AIS eLibrary</a>) with ‘literature review’ or ‘literature analysis’ and your topic as keywords</p>

<h3 data-anchor-id="searching-for-literature">Searching for literature</h3>
<p>It is most efficient to use open access databases (such as Google Scholar and the Directory of Open Access Journals) and specific subject databases (such as ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCO, IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library) to search for literature.</p>
<p>Search queries that reflect the defined search and inclusion criteria need to be defined.</p>
<p>The search should be supplemented further by backward and forward search.</p>

<p>Systematic information extraction from each paper to elicit the raw material for the synthesis step. The type of data to extract is based on the research question established during the protocol phase.</p>
<p>Qualitative coding techniques and related software packages can be used to extract data (e.g., MaxQDA or NVivo)</p>

<h3 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="appraising-quality">Appraising quality</h3>
<p>Once all potentially eligible papers have been collected, the papers should be ore closely examined to evaluate their quality. To assess a paper’s qualitative merit stricter criteria (or applying scoring on the inclusion criteria) should be applied (and reported).</p>
<p>Additional criteria could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usage of randomized controls,</li>
<li>degree of e.g., content and face validity, or</li>
<li>criteria related to the research question</li>
</ul>
<p>Only those that pass the threshold should be considered.</p>

<section id="synthesizing-studies" class="level3" data-visibility="hidden">
<h3 data-visibility="hidden" data-anchor-id="synthesizing-studies">Synthesizing studies</h3>
<p>At this stage, the reviewers aggregate, discuss, organized, and compare to gain a complete, polished synthesis of information using techniques like meta-analysis, content analysis, qualitative comparative analysis, grounded theory.</p>
<p>Transition from an author- to a concept-centric focus including e.g.,</p>
<ul>
<li>Concept-centric summary of existing literature</li>
<li>New propositions that arise from insights of synthesis</li>
<li>Comprehensive presentation of theory (old and new propositions)</li>
<li>Unanswered research questions (old and new)</li>

<p>I believe that the choice of research problem –choosing the phenomena we wish to explain or predict –is the most important decision we make as a researcher. We can learn research method. Albeit with greater difficulty, we can also learn theory-building skills. With some tutoring and experience, we can also learn to carve out large numbers of problems that we might research. Unfortunately, teasing out deep, substantive research problems is another matter. It remains a dark art. <em>Ron Weber, former EIC MIS Quarterly (2003)</em></p>

<p>The <strong>gap</strong> is usually the argument that something hasn’t been done yet.</p>
<p>The <strong>hook</strong> is a strategy to find a problem that someone cares about.</p>
<p>A bad gap is “nobody has studied …”, a good gap indicates a problem.</p>
<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>A contradiction in the literature (e.g., inconsistent observations or competing theoretical explanations)</li>
<li>Missing account for specific, important phenomena, understandings, or contexts (and why)</li>

<section id="specification" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>Research questions are typically one of two types <span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">(<a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">Recker 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<div class="notes">
<dl>
<dt>Type 1</dt>
<dd>
“What,” “who,” and “where” questions tend to focus on issues we seek to explore or describe because little knowledge exists about them. Example: <em>At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world realisedthat there was a new virus. The first step was then to find out everything about it: what it looks like, what it does, what its genetic structure is, where it occurs, who can be infected by it, and so forth.</em>
</dd>
<dt>Type 2</dt>
<dd>
“How” and “why” questions are explanatory as they seek to answer questions about the causal mechanisms that are at work in a particular phenomenon. Example: <em>We wanted to find out how the Covid-19 virus infects people so we could devise treatments and vaccinations that hinder the mechanism by which the virus infects people.</em>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Type 2 questions often temporally succeed type 1 questions as it is difficult to explain a phenomenon without first systematically exploring and describing it.</p>

</section>
<section id="quality-checks" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="quality-checks">Quality-checks</h2>
<p>The research question help you focus the study and give you guidance for how to conduct it.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="recker2021research">Recker (<a href="#ref-recker2021research" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> proposes following principles to reflect on if a RQ serves these functions well.</p>
<div class="incremental">
<ul class="incremental">
<li><strong>Short</strong>: Research questions have to be concise (rule of thumb: one line of text, max. 1.5 lines).</li>
<li><strong>Feasible</strong>: You should have answers to at least following questions: Are you able to observe all concepts you use in the research question? Are adequate subjects of study available? How will you collect the data? How will you analyze the data? Do you have the technical expertise, the time and money?</li>
<li><strong>Interesting</strong>: You are confident that you can maintain an interest in the topic and maintain your own motivation to study it.</li>
<li><strong>Novel</strong>: An answer will confirm or refute previous findings or provide new findings.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical</strong>: Pursuing and answering the question will not violate ethical principles for the conduct of research, and will not put the safety of the investigators or subjects at risk.</li>
<li><strong>Relevant</strong>: Both the question and the future answer(s) are important in the sense that they inform scientific knowledge, industry practice, and future research directions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="notes">
<p>In addition, consider the following checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research questions have to be formulated in a way that they cannot be answered by <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em> or similar binary results.</li>
<li>Research can not directly answer practical questions such as “How can I improve <em>X</em>?” To address such practical questions, you need to focus on what you don’t understand about the phenomena you are studying, and investigate what is really going on with these phenomena.</li>
<li>Research questions should not ask for potentially infinite lists of factors such as “What factors influence…”. Such questions are too vague and thus do not provide the focus needed.</li>
<li>Do not pack several questions into one sentence. Typical sign for several questions within one sentence are connections with “and” or “or”. Each question has to be presented in a separate sentence and has to be formulated as explicit question with question mark at the end of the sentence.</li>
<li>Research questions often relate one or more variables to one another and ask for relationships. In the following <em>“y”</em> means the dependent variable (the variable to be explained, improved, influenced,..) and <em>“x”</em> the independent variables (= the variable that are assumed to exert an influence on y). Research questions often look like this: „How is x related to y? What is the role of x for y? Why does x influence y? To which extent does x influence y?
<ul>
<li>The expression “To which extent” when used in research questions needs statistical evaluations and measurement in numbers. They typically cannot be answered by qualitative research.</li>
<li>For empirical work, the research question needs at least two precisely formulated variables. Checkpoints: Does the question contain at least two variables that are formulated in a way that you can imagine that they can be measured? What could be the source of data? Is there access to the data?</li>
<li>Variables should not express an activity or process because that would require a longitudinal study (= study over time with several measurement periods). This typically exceeds the timeframe of a master’s thesis.</li>
