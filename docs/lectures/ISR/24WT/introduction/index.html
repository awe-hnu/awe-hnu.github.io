<p>Two types of science can be distinguished:</p>
<p>Two types: - <strong>Natural sciences</strong> concern the study of naturally occurring phenomena. The phenomena are real and tangible (such as bodies, plants, or matters), though sometimes difficult to observe (e.g., subatomic particles) - <strong>Social sciences</strong> concern the study of people or collections of people. These sciences are composed of psychology, sociology, organizational science, and economics</p>
</div>

<section id="types-of-sciences" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="types-of-sciences">Types of sciences</h2>
<div class="notes">
<p>The distinction between natural and social is very important to understand because the inquiries or research processes for the two are very different.</p>
<p>The <strong>natural sciences</strong> are referred to as the “exact sciences” : these inquiries rely on precise and accurate measurements of phenomena or their properties. Examples of such work are readily found in any high school chemistry or physics department. In the natural science of physics, for example, properties such as the speed of light or gravity have been calculated and will remain invariant.</p>
<p><strong>The social sciences</strong> are even further away from precision. In the social sciences, phenomena as well as measurements are often vague, imprecise, non-deterministic, and ambiguous. Think about a study that examines whether happy people sleep more or less than unhappy people. Problems abound when we try to understand let alone precisely measure what happiness means, or when we try to isolate the true cause of variation in sleep length. We all know that for any two given days people will not likely sleep for the same amount of time, and there are plenty of reasons for this variation: there could be noise in the bedroom, light shining through the window, more or less wind breezing through the room, the person could have eaten differently in turn affecting their sleep patterns, the person could have had a good dream or a nightmare, and so forth. Many reasons may contribute to different durations of sleep – and but one of them may be related to some form or other of happiness!</p>
<p>One of the many manifestations of this issue is the challenge of measurement error. Measurement error is invariably present in the social sciences. This issue recognizes that because of the complexity, vagueness, and ambiguity of many of the phenomena under study, many of which we cannot faithfully define or isolate precisely, there will always be imprecision in the way we study our phenomena of interest, and the findings we in turn obtain.</p>

<p>Reality is a subjective experience because we are limited and confined to our own human way of seeing things. Like a person that has never left a cave and can therefore never know any other reality, so too are people. They see things from the perspective of their own “cave”.</p>
