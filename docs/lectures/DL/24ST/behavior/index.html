<div class="notes">
<p>Path-goal theory emphasizes that leaders need to <strong>clarify the paths to goals</strong>, remove obstacles, and provide necessary support to help followers reach their objectives efficiently. It highlights the importance of <strong>adapting leadership behaviors</strong> to suit the needs of followers and the situation they are working in. Ultimately, the theory reminds leaders that their primary role is to coach and guide followers towards goal achievement by <strong>selecting behaviors that best fit followers’ needs and the working environment.</strong></p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="path-goal-clarifying-behaviors">Path-goal clarifying behaviors</h2>
<p>The path-goal theory assumes that under conditions role and task demands that are ambiguous and intrinsically satisfying, goal-oriented behavior by superiors is helpful and instrumental to task performance. Thus, following things need to be clarified:</p>

<li>the <strong>means</strong> by which subordinates can effectively carry out tasks,</li>
<li>the <strong>standards</strong> by which subordinate’s performance will be judged,</li>

<li>judicious use of <strong>rewards and punishment</strong>, contingent on performance.</li>

<li><p>Leaders’ behavior complements subordinates’ environments and abilities — effective leaders engage in behaviors that align with and support their subordinates’ environments and abilities. The higher the degree of subordinates self-perceived ability relative to task demands, the less subordinates will view path-goal clarifying behavior as acceptable (motivational).</p></li>
<li><p>Leaders’ path-goal clarifying behavior adapts to different situations — effective leaders adjust their behavior based on the specific circumstances, tasks (e.g., ambiguity), and characteristics of their followers (e.g., preference for independence). This adaptability ensures that leaders can effectively guide and motivate their subordinates towards achieving goals.</p></li>

<h2 data-anchor-id="work-engagement">Work engagement</h2>
<p>Work engagement refers to “a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterized by <em>vigor</em>, <em>dedication</em>, and <em>absorption</em>” <span class="citation" data-cites="schaufeli2002measurement">(<a href="#ref-schaufeli2002measurement" role="doc-biblioref">W.

<ul class="incremental">
<li><strong>Vigor</strong> refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one’s work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties</li>
<li><strong>Dedication</strong> refers to being strongly involved in one’s work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge</li>
<li><strong>Absorption</strong> refers to being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one’s work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Work engagement differs from <strong>work addiction</strong>. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don’t, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="taris2014beauty">Taris, Beek, and Schaufeli (<a href="#ref-taris2014beauty" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation.

<li><strong>Facilitating</strong> team-members satisfies the need for <em>autonomy</em> by giving them the feeling that they are psychologically free to make their own decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening</strong> team-members satisfies the need for <em>competence</em>, e.g., by delegating tasks and responsibilities, giving them challenging jobs and stimulating their talents.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting</strong> team-members satisfies the need for <em>relatedness</em>, e.g., by encouraging collaboration and creating a good team spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiring</strong> team-members satisfies the need for <em>meaning</em>, e.g., by enthusing them about a particular vision, mission, idea or plan and recognising their personal contribution to the overall goal of the team or organisation.</li>

<p>According to <span class="citation" data-cites="hill2003becoming">Hill (<a href="#ref-hill2003becoming" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, an effective team does not only involve <strong>team performance</strong>, but is characterized by three criteria:</p>

<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>The team <em>performs</em>: the output meets the standards of those who have to use it</li>
<li>The team members are <em>satisfied and learn</em> (i.e., the team experience contributes to each member’s personal well-being and development)</li>
<li>The team <em>adapts and learns</em> (i.e., the team experience enhances the capability of members to work and learn together in the future)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In today’s dynamic environment, <strong>engaging leadership</strong> should facilitate, strengthen, connect and inspire employees to improve on all three interrelated criteria.</p>
