The focus of the live sessions is on discussing real world cases and developing theoretically-based explanations. In addition, you will do an original research on a digital innovation case on your own (see assignment).\nIt is of uttermost importance that you prepare yourself for every session. You either need to work through teaching materials in advance or prepare to present the deliverables of your own case (see Table 1).\n\n\nContents\nThis course offers you the possibility to learn about industry-specific challenges and how this influences the way of organizing, managing and communicating digital innovations, in particular:\n\n\nSpecifics of industries (context, products, markets, obstacles, enablers)\nIndustry-specific applicability and adaptations of innovation strategies\nMethods for discovering need finding, ideation and prototyping of digital innovations\nCase studies of digital innovation in industries\nTheories that explain the mechanisms of digital innovations\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nDuring this course, you should advance your skills in the following areas:\n\n\nEnhanced knowledge of various industries and their special characteristics\nUnderstanding of specifics of managing digital innovations in these industries\nKnowledge of theoretical models that help to explain and manage these innovations\nAbility to analyze specificities and complexities of different industries\nCapacity to adapt digital innovation management methods and tools accordingly\nAbility to clearly communicate conclusions and the underlying rationale\nAbility to evaluate new information and to question existing assumptions\nExpertise to develop independent contributions to practical and theoretical discourse\n\n\n\n\nEffort\nYou will gain 5 ECTS for this course. This equals approx. 150 hours workload, of which you need most to pass the course.\n\n\nLive sessions (approx. 40 hours)\nPreparation of the live sessions (approx. 20 hours)\nCase research and writing (approx. 90 hours)\n\n\n\nPlease prepare your schedule accordingly.\n\n\n\nGrading\nThe grade is based on the evaluation of the written case study (see assignment).\nThe presentations are mandatory but will not be graded individually.\n\n\nSchedule\n\nIt is of uttermost importance that you prepare yourself for the sessions and work on the case study continually.
