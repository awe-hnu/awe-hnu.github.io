Therefore, one cannot identify and reject a poor strategy, or improve a good one.\nFailure to identify and analyse the obstacles leads merely to stretch goals/budgets/wish lists.\n\nMistaking goals for strategy:\n\nIt is important to see the distinction between the goals, and the strategy used to achieve those goals.\nThe job of a leader – the strategist – is to have a strategy that focuses effort on achieving the goal.\n\nBad strategic objectives:\n\nAnother sign of poor strategy is fuzzy strategic objectives. This problem manifests itself as: a long list of things to do/accomplish, mislabelled as strategies; a ‘blue sky’ – a restatement of the challenge/desired state of affairs that does not identify ‘how’ to get there.\nGood strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one/very few pivotal objectives, whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.\nGood strategy also creates a link between short-term objectives/action and the long-term strategic goal.\n\nFluff:\n\nPoor strategy is often characterized by ‘fluff’, or superficial abstraction.\nFluff is a restatement of the obvious, combined with a generous sprinkling of buzzwords that masquerade as expertise."

Thus, there will be no need for reformulation during implementation.\n\nConsequently, a strategy cannot be a fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at a predetermined time solely at the will of management (e.g., as a result of strategy deviations). Similarly, contingency planning, a popular prescription in times of environmental turmoil, can be risky because plans can tend to come to fruition whether they are needed or not. And so sometimes it can also be risky to make strategy explicit, especially in an uncertain environment with a dominant organizational operating system tending towards stability (Mintzberg 1978).\nMintzberg (1978) instead highlights that strategy formation is not a one-size-fits-all process. Rather, it involves various approaches and patterns, including entrepreneurial, adaptive, planning, and logical incrementalism.\n\nEntrepreneurial approach: Strategy emerges from a single visionary leader.\nAdaptive approach: Strategies evolve incrementally in response to changing circumstances.\nPlanned approach: Formal strategic planning processes drive strategy formulation. Logical incrementalism: A blend of planning and adaptation, where strategies develop incrementally.\n\nConsequently, strategy formation is not limited to formal processes or boardroom decisions. Informal interactions, serendipity, and learning from experience play a significant role. Likewise, aligning organizational actions with formulated strategies can be complex and may require ongoing adjustment.\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived. They are open minded, sensitive to experience and learn about their organisations/industries through personal involvement."

Formulation and implementation merge into a fluid process of learning through which creativity evolves.\nThe craftsman has an intimate knowledge of his/her work, capabilities and markets. In considering future prospects, they draw upon their past experiences. This knowledge is ‘tacit’–they sense rather than analyse these things.\nSimilarly, effective corporate strategies also evolve through such a creative process. Strategists are craftsmen, who link corporate capabilities to future market opportunities. They use their past experiences, and bring to their work an equally intimate knowledge of the issues they deal with."

Only by coming to understand the patterns that form in their own behavior do they get to know their capabilities and their potential. Thus crafting stategy, like managing craft, requires a natural synthesis of future, present and past. Mintzberg (1987)\n\n\n\n\nStrategies are both plans for the future and patterns from the past.\nStrategies need not be deliberate—they can also emerge, more or less.\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways.\nStrategic reorientation happen in brief, quantum leaps.\nManaging strategy is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans for the future and patterns from the past\nThe term ‘strategy’ is used as much to explain past behavior (pattern in actions over time, or realized strategy) as to describe intended behavior (the plan). A plan need not necessarily produce a pattern. So too, a pattern need not result from a plan.\n\n\nStrategies need not be deliberate – they can also emerge, more or less\nThe interplay of strategy formulation and implementation\nA realized strategy can be the result of a deliberate process involving formulation followed by successful implementation. However, it can also emerge as an adaptive response to evolving circumstances.\nWhen planned intentions fall short of achieving desired outcomes, organizations may find themselves with unrealized strategies. This can be attributed to challenges in implementation, but it may also stem from the belief that strategies should be strictly planned rather than allowed to evolve gradually through an organization’s actions and experiences.\nThe synergy of thought and action\nSimilar to how skilled craftspeople seamlessly blend thought and action in their craft, organizations should not separate the aspects of ‘thinking’ and ‘doing’ in strategy.\nStrategy is deeply intertwined with the day-to-day operational details of running an organization. Effective strategy does not exist in isolation but is deeply embedded in the organizational context.\nBalancing control and adaptation\nPurely deliberate strategy formulation can limit an organization’s ability to learn and adapt once the strategy is set in stone. In contrast, emergent strategy allows for ongoing adaptation but may risk losing control.\nAchieving effective strategy making requires a balance between learning and responsiveness on one hand and maintaining a level of control on the other. Therefore, in practice, strategy making often blends deliberate and emergent strategies to strike this balance.\n\n\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways\nEffective strategies can take shape through a variety of unconventional and unexpected paths. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategy development.\nSurprising as it may seem, errors can transform into opportunities, limitations can ignite creativity, and even moments of boredom can lead to significant strategic change.\nEmpowering strategy development from the bottom up\nOften strategies originate at lower organizational levels, nurtured by individuals with both technical expertise and a deep understanding of the on-ground realities. With the right resources and a capacity for learning, these locally generated strategies evolve into collective and organizational approaches.\nThese grass-roots strategies are particularly prevalent in businesses that require a high degree of expertise and creative thinking. In these organizations, strategy development is not confined to boardrooms but is embraced at all levels. Technical experts who are intimately familiar with the business’s intricacies play a central role in shaping the strategies that drive success.\n\n\nStrategic reorientations happen in brief, quantum leaps\nStrategic reorientation often manifest as abrupt and significant transformations, challenging the traditional perspective that change in an organization should be continuous.\nWhile conventional wisdom suggests continuous adaptation, strategy inherently seeks to establish stability. Organisations pursue a given strategic orientation for most of the time, as they achieve success not by changing strategies, but by exploiting the ones they have. However, when that strategic orientation grows out of sync with its environment over time, revolutionary change must take place. The organisation quickly alters many of its established patterns, as it tries to leap/shift to a new position of stability.\nA crucial aspect of strategy-making is navigating the delicate equilibrium between preserving stability and responding to external changes.\n\n\nTo manage strategy, then, is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived.

Peter Drucker, Management consultant, educator and author\n\n\n\nThe most brilliant strategies can fail if they are not congruent with the prevailing culture within an organization. Successful organizations, thus, integrate culture and strategy.\n\n\nThe phrase conveys the idea that a company’s culture, which includes its shared values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can have a more substantial influence on the organization’s outcomes than its strategic plans or strategies. In other words, a well-crafted strategy may look excellent on paper, but if it doesn’t align with or is undermined by the prevailing organizational culture, it is less likely to succeed (Drucker et al. 1988).\n\nAn organization’s culture influences how employees behave, make decisions, and interact with one another. If a strategic plan contradicts cultural norms or values, employees are likely to prioritize cultural consistency over strategic alignment.\nCulture can either enable or constrain the execution of strategic initiatives. A supportive culture aligns with the strategy, fosters commitment, and drives performance. Conversely, a culture that resists change or lacks alignment can hinder even the most well-conceived strategy.\nLeaders play a crucial role in shaping and aligning culture with strategy. Effective leaders understand the culture’s impact and work to foster a culture that supports the strategic vision.\nSuccessful organizations integrate culture and strategy. They develop strategies that not only consider external market dynamics but also respect and leverage the existing culture. Additionally, they may seek to evolve the culture to better support strategic goals.\n\nImplications (David and David 2016):\n\nStrategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive changes can take considerable time and effort\nPolitical maneuvering consumes valuable time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some valuable employees\nPolitical biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded in strategy choice decisions"

    "text": "Key assumptions\n\nThe RBV contends that internal resources are critical for achieving and sustaining competitive advantage, even more important than the environment.\n\nQuestions of value, rareness, imitability/substitutability (VRIN), and organisation must be addressed.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the sources of competitive advantages calls for an analysis of not only the company’s environment (opportunities and threats), but its own/internal strengths and weaknesses as well (Barney 1995).\nThis point is clearly highlighted when we consider the success achieved by companies such as WalMart, Southwest Airlines and Nucor Steel, despite unfavorable environments.\nA firm’s internal attributes – its resources and capabilities – include all the financial, physical, human and organisational assets used by a firm to develop, manufacture and deliver products/services to its customers.\nResources and capabilities that cannot be readily matched by competitors are referred to as distinctive competencies. To identify a company’s distinctive competencies, resources and capabilities must be evaluated by considering four important questions:\n\nThe question of value.\nThe question of rareness.\nThe question of imitability.\nThe question of organisation.\n\n\nThe question of value\nResources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm’s ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues (Barney 1995).\nManagers need to check if the firm’s resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats.\n\nManagers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities.\nManagers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not.\nManagers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors.\nManagers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways.\n\n\n\nThe question of rareness\nResources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage (Barney 1995).\nTherefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them.\n\nIf a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, i.e. it is valuable but common, then it forms a source of competitive parity.\nResources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage.\n\n\n\nThe question of imitability\nResources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes or alternatives for the resource. In other words, competitors cannot easily find a different resource to replace or replicate the unique value of the resource or capability (Barney 1995).\nThus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability identified as valuable and rare face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it, compared to firms that already possess it.\n\nIf a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.\n\nIf competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage.\nImitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources.\n\n\n\nThe question of organization\nThe organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the four VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization to maximize its impact. In addition, resources often work best when they are integrated with other resources and capabilities within the organization (Barney 1995)?\nThus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities.\n\nA firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage arising from the value, rareness and imitability of its resources and capabilities.\nThe firm’s complementary resources – for example, its formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant/important for a firm to realize competitive advantage.\nTo create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation."

This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.\nSeizing: Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nReconfiguring: In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization’s structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation."

They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.\nSeizing: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.\nReconfiguring: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple’s app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.\n\nApple’s success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. This adaptability and innovation have enabled Apple to consistently deliver products and services that resonate with consumers worldwide."

And why is this the case, or why not?\nHow might it inform your own thinking about the field?\nHow do you think the reading influenced the state of knowledge in the field at the time it was published?\n\nAdditional strategies\n\nUse highlighting or annotation: As you read, use highlighting, underlining, or digital annotation tools to mark key points, important concepts, and relevant citations. This can help you quickly locate and review important information later. Read Strategically: If you’re reading a longer paper, consider reading strategically by reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph. This can give you a sense of the main ideas without getting bogged down in every detail.\nFollow citations: If a paper references other works that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related resrks that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related research.\nTake breaks: Reading complex material for extended periods can lead to reduced comprehension. Take short breaks to maintain focus and prevent fatigue.\nUtilize summaries: In addition to reading full papers, consider using summaries, reviews, or annotated bibliographies to get an overview of key concepts and findings before deciding whether to delve into the complete paper."

Example: We wanted to find out how the Covid-19 virus infects people so we could devise treatments and vaccinations that hinder the mechanism by which the virus infects people.\n\n\nType 2 questions often temporally succeed type 1 questions as it is difficult to explain a phenomenon without first systematically exploring and describing it."

    "text": "Quality-checks\nThe research question help you focus the study and give you guidance for how to conduct it.\nRecker (2021) proposes following principles to reflect on if a RQ serves these functions well.\n\n\nShort: Research questions have to be concise (rule of thumb: one line of text, max. 1.5 lines).\nFeasible: You should have answers to at least following questions: Are you able to observe all concepts you use in the research question? Are adequate subjects of study available? How will you collect the data? How will you analyze the data? Do you have the technical expertise, the time and money?\nInteresting: You are confident that you can maintain an interest in the topic and maintain your own motivation to study it.\nNovel: An answer will confirm or refute previous findings or provide new findings.\nEthical: Pursuing and answering the question will not violate ethical principles for the conduct of research, and will not put the safety of the investigators or subjects at risk.\nRelevant: Both the question and the future answer(s) are important in the sense that they inform scientific knowledge, industry practice, and future research directions.\n\n\n\nIn addition, consider the following checks:\n\nResearch questions have to be formulated in a way that they cannot be answered by Yes or No or similar binary results.\nResearch can not directly answer practical questions such as “How can I improve X?” To address such practical questions, you need to focus on what you don’t understand about the phenomena you are studying, and investigate what is really going on with these phenomena.\nResearch questions should not ask for potentially infinite lists of factors such as “What factors influence…”. Such questions are too vague and thus do not provide the focus needed.\nDo not pack several questions into one sentence. Typical sign for several questions within one sentence are connections with “and” or “or”. Each question has to be presented in a separate sentence and has to be formulated as explicit question with question mark at the end of the sentence.\nResearch questions often relate one or more variables to one another and ask for relationships. In the following “y” means the dependent variable (the variable to be explained, improved, influenced,..) and “x” the independent variables (= the variable that are assumed to exert an influence on y). Research questions often look like this: „How is x related to y? What is the role of x for y? Why does x influence y? To which extent does x influence y?\n\nThe expression “To which extent” when used in research questions needs statistical evaluations and measurement in numbers. They typically cannot be answered by qualitative research.\nFor empirical work, the research question needs at least two precisely formulated variables. Checkpoints: Does the question contain at least two variables that are formulated in a way that you can imagine that they can be measured? What could be the source of data? Is there access to the data?\nVariables should not express an activity or process because that would require a longitudinal study (= study over time with several measurement periods). This typically exceeds the timeframe of a master’s thesis."

Kim Scott1 even states that relationship maintenance should be a top priority when you move into a leadership position. She advises leaders in radical candid communication (Scott 2019)—straightforward and humanizing management, following the principles outlined below1 A leader of high-profile teams in the Silicon Valley at Google, Apple and Twitter.\n\nCaring personally\nCaring personally means caring about people for more than just their jobs. As a leader, you need to care about them on a personal level. This includes learning more about them as a person—their interests, motivations, and ambitions—and learning more about their “whole self”—who they are outside of work and how their personal life might impact their needs at work.\nWhen you show that you care personally about your employees, their trust in you grows. This has far-reaching implications: When your employees trust you and feel that you have their best interests at heart, they will be honest with you, more receptive to your feedback, and more confident in your decisions. Likewise, you will find that you can be more honest with them and have more confidence in their decisions.\nWe often fail to care personally. One reason is that work culture encourages us to stay professional and hide our feelings. Another one, less virtuous, is a tendency to become arrogant once you find yourself in a boss chair.\n\n\nChallenging directly\nChallenging directly means having difficult but necessary conversations with your employees, e.g., conversations where you criticize or disagree with decisions they’ve made. These conversations might feel too difficult, especially if you haven’t had a chance to build a caring, trusting relationship with the person in question. However, you have to let the principle of challenging directly drive you into these discussions for several important reasons.\nFirst, these conversations offer the recipient of the feedback an opportunity to improve and avoid further problems and difficult conversations. Second, by being direct, you show that you care about the person and their improvement enough to put up with the inconvenience of a difficult conversation. This, of course, helps you build a trusting relationship with the person you are talking to.\nIf, on the other hand, you didn’t adhere to the principles of radical openness and avoided the conversation, your employee would continue to fall short - and he would probably know it. If you constantly reassure him that everything is “fine,” it shows that you are not being honest with him when necessary, and that destroys the potential for a trusting relationship."

Praise from a place of radical candor is very specific to the recipient—when you are acting with radical candor, you should be attuned to how your praise is landing with your recipient and be prepared to change it if it’s not quite right.\npraise—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements. Criticism from a place of radical candor is always sincere, and is given both when things go poorly and when things go well.\n\nIf you succeed in two of the dimensions, your guidance is Radical Candor. But what if you fail, in one of those or in both? To demonstrate that, Scott (2019) draws a coordinate system, where care personally is Y, and challenge directly is X. This way, she comes up with three other types of guidance, analyzing those through the prism of criticism and praise.\n\nOffensive aggression\nOffensive aggression happens when a boss treats employees without respect, belittling and publicly embarrassing them. Obnoxiously aggressive criticism can be effective but at a very high cost: it “sometimes gets great results short-term but leaves a trail of dead bodies in its wake in the long run.” Similarly, praising people aggressively (for example, under wrong circumstances) can make them feel underestimated or even ashamed instead of valued.\n\n\nManipulative insincerity\nManipulative insincere guidance is the result of a leader’s desire to be liked and take advantage of it. In this case, both criticism and praise are used to play on other people’s emotions. Even aggressive obnoxious guidance is better—at least, you know what to expect.\n\n\nDestructive empathy\nDestructive empathy occurs when bosses are trying to reduce tension but instead create even more pain, prioritizing friendly communication over improving performance. Ruinously empathetic bosses do not criticize at all – they do not insist on solving issues but rather let them go. Their praise is superficial and feels like flattery, not proved by any serious background.\nRadical candor is different. You can criticize—but only with the noble aim to help see mistakes and correct them. You can praise—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements."

    "text": "Understanding motivation\nTo build an effective team, a leader must recognize the diversity of its members.\nScott (2019) divides workers in two categories—rock stars and superstars.\n\nRock stars are on a gradual growth trajectory:\nThey are happy in their current role and focus on stability.\nTo motivate rock stars, you can give them bonuses or simply say thank you for their work.\nSuper stars are on a steep growth path:\nThey always look for a change and are very ambitious.\nSuper stars get inspired when you constantly challenge them and give them new opportunities.\n\nCohesiveness of a team depends on the contributions of both rock stars and superstars, in a proportion that is relevant to a particular type of work.\nThese labels are not permanent—growth trajectories and goals change constantly, based on work or life events that dictate the amount of work someone can take on. Someone who was once a high performer may reach a point where they are no longer invested in the work and become a low performer, or one of your superstars may have a situation in their home life that slows their growth for the time being. For example, Scott—usually in a superstar role—found herself needing extra time to readjust after the birth of her twins. She asked to be placed in a rock star role for several years, allowing her to spend more time with her family. When she was ready, she jumped back onto her superstar trajectory.\nBecause circumstances are constantly changing, it’s important that you frequently check in with your employees to learn about what’s going on in their lives, talk about their ambitions, and ensure that their growth trajectory suits them. Some recommendations:\n\nSuperstars: Make sure you are offering them challenges and projects that will help them continue to learn.\nRock stars: Make sure you are offering them what they need to feel appreciated and continue doing consistent strong work.\nMediocre: Think of what you can offer them to give them a boost, such as classes or projects, or consider if they’d do better elsewhere.\nLow performance with expected rapid growth: Think of what you can offer them in terms of clearer guidelines, better training, or a transfer to a role they are better suited for."

    "section": "Principles",
    "text": "Principles\nScott (2019) offers some guiding principles to help you commit to radical candor and to best set up your employees for sincere feedback:\n\n\nFocus #1: Humility—your goal is shared understanding\nFocus #2: Helpfulness—you are doing this to help\nFocus #3: Immediacy—in the moment, or shortly thereafter\nFocus #4: In-person—not via text\nFocus #5: Public praise, private criticism\nFocus #6: Caring personally does not mean personalizing\n\n\n\n\nHumility\nHumility is important in both criticism and praise. Criticism without humility can make people feel defensive, and praise without humility can sound insincere or arrogant. There are three concepts on which humble leadership should be based:\n\nPrecise framing of your feedback: When you are giving feedback, frame it around three things—the situation, the person’s behavior, and the outcome. This helps you avoid arrogant generalizations about the person, both in criticism and praise.\nAn effective filter: After feedback that didn’t go well, write down what was actually said in the conversation and what you were thinking during the conversation—this helps you to figure out where the conversation went wrong.\nSeparation of reality and experience: Remember that your experience or subjective observation of a situation is not necessarily the objective truth—this will help you invite challenge as much as you hand it out. Give people the opportunity to tell you about their reality.\n\n\n\nHelpfulness\nRadically candid feedback does the heavy lifting by clarifying what the problem is, so your employee can find the solution more quickly—this is accomplished through three helpful actions:\n\nMaking your intentions clear. Criticism usually prompts defensive reactions. When you state that your intent is to help, not to be hurtful, your employees become more receptive to your feedback.\nBeing as precise as possible. It’s tempting to give vague criticism so you don’t have to dive into the discomfort of fully discussing a tough situation. Precision about what’s good or bad about someone’s behavior clearly demonstrates what they should do more or less of.\nOutsourcing help when possible. Helping each of your team members personally with their issues would be impossibly time-consuming. Instead, look for external help to offer to your employees when appropriate and available.\n\n\n\nImmediacy\nFeedback is most effective when it comes immediately after a situation that deserves attention. It is not a good idea to save feedback for meetings for several reasons:\n\nYou run the risk of forgetting the very thing you wanted to talk about or the specifics of a situation.\nYou’ll often find that problems are too far in the past to be fixed, or that successes are too far in the past to build on.\n\nConsistent feedback allows employees to understand and contextualize how their work is perceived or used. Without the context that comes with praise or criticism, employees feel that their work is not noticed or appreciated and become unmotivated and bored with their work.\nMake sure your schedule allows for post-meeting feedback by stopping meetings 5 minutes before schedule, or by scheduling meetings a minimum of 15 minutes apart. Good feedback doesn’t need to take a long time—the best feedback is consistent and specific.\n\n\nIn-Person\nIt’s best to deliver your feedback in person—you can see how your feedback is being received by theother person, and you avoid misunderstandings that can come from the nuances of written communication.\n\n\nPublic praise, private criticism\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should always default to giving praise in public and criticism in private.\n\nPublic praise tends to be more meaningful for the recipient and demonstrates what your team should do more of.\nPublic criticism tends to trigger defensiveness.\n\n\n\nCaring personally does not mean personalizing\nWhen giving criticism, make sure that you are criticizing the problem or the idea, rather than the person. Attributing a character trait to someone as an explanation for their behavior doesn’t get to the root of the problem.\nIf your criticism starts with “you are,” rethink it."

This makes me feel like you weren’t hearing me and won’t go to the speech coach I’m recommending, which would be a shame because if you stop saying ‘um’ so much, you’ll be more effective (R).

It is easy to take our surroundings for granted, but they have a big impact on any interaction. Paying attention to details like these will help make conversations more productive.\n\n\nTimimg. Choose a time when you and the other person will both at your best, e.g., at the beginning of the day.\nDuration. Think about how much time a given feedback conversation is likely to take if it goes well—and if it goes poorly.\nPhysical location. Choose a location that suits the needs of the conversation, ensures sufficient privacy, and minimizes interruptions and distractions.\nProximity. Think about the optimal proxiomity between you and the other person at that moment (e.g., authority vs. strong connection)\n\n\nConcentrate on the message, you want to convey. Focus on facts, not assumptions. I recommend to consider the CORe method. Either way, take enough time to prepare your message.\nManage emotions. Express just enough emotion to engage the other person but not so much that you provoke a hostile ore defensive reaction, shut down the conversation, or damage the relationship.\nPractice and repeat. As with any skill you’re trying to master, experiment in low-risk situations before jumping into a high-stakes feedback conversation."

Triggers fall into three general categories (Stone and Heen 2014):\n\nTruth triggers\n—emotional responses to feedback we feel is wrong, unhelpful, or unfair.\nRelationship triggers\n—emotional responses to the person giving the feedback more than the content of the feedback itself.\nIdentity triggers\n—emotional responses to feedback that threatens our sense of who we are."

Thus,\n\n\ndiscuss, where it is coming from (data and interpretations)\nand going to (advice, consequences, expectations);\nask, what is different about the data we are looking and our interpretations; and\nask, what is right about the feedback to find out what is legit\nand what concerns you have in common.\n\n\nAlso remember: to see ourselves and our blind spots we need help from others\n\n\nWhen our truth trigger is activated, we reject the content of the feedback and label it as wrong, unhelpful, or unfair. To counteract this instinct, you should fully examine the feedback so that you can properly decipher the “truth” of the feedback.\n\nFeedback has two elements\nFeedback usually has two parts: a “looking back” part (“This is what I noticed”) and a “looking forward” part (“This is what you should do”). The “looking back” part consists of observations and interpretations of those observations—how a person feels about them. The forward-looking part of the feedback is about next steps: advice, consequences, and expectations.\nTo find common ground, recognize that different people have different “truths.” Your views of another person are subjective, your interpretations are not necessarily more correct than other people’s, and your assessment of how to fix problems may vary.\n\n\nControlling the truth triggers\nUnderstanding feedback requires examining not only the other person’s thoughts and feelings, but also your own. There are two key strategies: finding your own blind spots and looking for differences rather than “wrongs.”\n\nFind your blind spots and referrals\nA “blind spot” is something that we ignore or give little importance to, but that other people see clearly. When other people give us feedback on a trait we are blind to, we dismiss it as untrue. Recognizing our blind spots can prevent this from happening. There are two main categories of blind spots:\n\nBehavioral patterns: a person often engages in behavioral patterns that they themselves are not aware of, but that others around them clearly see.\nYour “tells”: your face, voice, and other nonverbal behaviors can reveal your true thoughts and emotions.\n\nThese are amplified by:\n\nEmotional bias: we discount our emotions, while others count them double.\nAttribution: we attribute our failure to the situation, while others attribute it to the character.\nImpact-intent gap: we judge ourselves by our intentions, while others judge us by our impact on them.\n\n\n\nLook for differences and rights, not wrongs\nInstead of wondering why the feedback is wrong, acknowledge that you and the other person see things differently and try to figure out why. When you master difference-spotting in this way, you will be able to better understand the other person’s views and move from “No, that is wrong” to “Tell me more” (Stone and Heen 2014).\nFinally, ask yourself what is right about the other person’s feedback. Figure out what is meaningful about the feedback, what might be worth trying, and how you can make sense of it that might be helpful (Stone and Heen 2014)."

Also try to step back to see the whole system22 E.g., Are there differences in opinion, values, and habits, roles clashes as well as processes, policies or other players that reinforce the problem?\n\n\n\n\nWe can manage these relationship triggers by disentangling our reaction to the feedback from our reaction to the person giving it. There are two primary relationship triggers (Stone and Heen 2014):\n\nOur opinion of them: When receiving feedback, we are often quick to look for something that disqualifies the person from giving it (skill or judgment; credibility; and trustworthiness of the giver)\nTheir treatment of us: Our perception of how the other person treats us often determines whether or not we accept or ignore their feedback.\n\nThere are three general relationship elements that commonly affect us:\n\nSwitchtracking\nOften when we are relationship-triggered, we “switchtrack”: We respond to a piece of feedback with a reciprocal piece of feedback that is usually aimed at the person raising the issue rather than the issue itself. The conversation splits and starts following two entirely different tracks. For example, if your roommate tells you she’s tired of you not cleaning up the kitchen, and you respond, “Why are you always so critical of me?”, you have just switchtracked the conversation. When we don’t realize we are dealing with two separate topics, we end up talking over one another instead of resolving problems (Stone and Heen 2014).\n\n\nControlling relationship triggers\nControl your relationship triggers by properly managing switchtracking and then stepping back to see the whole system. The goal in controlling a relationship trigger is to recognize when you have two topics on the table, and address each properly.\n\nSpot the two topics: Be alert for conversations where one person raises an issue and the second person responds with a statement or question that focuses on the first person herself, instead of the content of the issue.\nDiscuss the two topics: Give each topic its own track by acknowledging that you are now talking about two different things. Then, decide with the other person which topic to discuss first.\nWatch for additional triggers: Just because you have identified two separate topics doesn’t mean you are out of the woods. Be alert for ambiguities that might hint at deeper issues lurking below, and address them explicitly.\n\nSometimes, we are too close to a situation to see it clearly. Viewing your conflict as part of a system can help you get a fuller understanding of how and why you might be clashing with someone else. Using a systems-focused lens will allow you to take control of the influences around you instead of being controlled by them."

(Stone and Heen 2014) proposes to\n\nbe prepared, be mindful: be aware of your reactions in the moment—slow down when you feel yourself getting emotional;\nseparate your emotions from the story: name your feelings explicitly so that you can judge how they are affecting your interpretation of the feedback;\ncontain the story: change your point of view, imagine you are an observer of your own situation, or imagine how you’ll see it five years from now.

There are several ways to accomplish this:\n\nCreate silence: count to six after asking for criticism. Your employee may be more uncomfortable with silence than with criticizing you, and will say what’s on their mind to fill the space.\nKeep asking: Keep insisting that they come up with something.\nNotice body language: If someone says they have no criticism, but their body language clearly says otherwise, bring it to their attention.\n\n\n\nManage your response\nWhen someone offers you criticism, it’s crucial that you respond in a way that shows that their criticism iswelcome and well-received—this is where trust is built.\n\nDon’t tell them how their criticism is wrong or not radically candid.\nBe careful not to become angry or defensive in response to what they are saying.\nListen with the intent to clarify and fullyunderstand the criticism.\nRepeat what’s been said and checking that your interpretation is correct.\n\n\n\nDemonstrate your gratitude\nShowing your gratitude for criticism encourages people to keep giving it. The best way to show gratitude for criticism is responding with demonstrated change.\n\nIf it’s a change that can be done right away, do so.\nIf it’s a change that can’t be accomplished right away, make a perceptible effort toward the change\n\nIt’s important to express gratitude for criticism even when you think it’s unfair, or don’t agree. Arguing with or dismissing criticism you disagree with will only serve to undermine the trust you are trying to build, so instead focus on ways to work through it.\nSteps you should take, if you do not agree:\n\nFind something in the criticism that you can agree with\nMake sure you fully understand what the other person is expressing\nTell them you’d like to think about it and get back to them.\nIn your follow-up, explain clearly why you disagree, or why making a change won’t be possible.\n\nOnce you get the ball rolling and your employees are gaining confidence in giving you guidance, you need to start giving them guidance in return."

Any employee can nominate another for the achievement award by naming an accomplishment or outstanding work they have seen from their colleague during the week.

    "text": "Sparkle collaboration\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The getting stuff done wheel (Scott 2019)\n\n\n\nA key goal of a radically candid workplace is to build a highly collaborative climate and a team that works together to accomplish much more than anyone could individually (Scott 2019). The principle of personal caring is particularly important to a collaborative atmosphere for several reasons. First, it allows you to shift perspectives, that is, to incorporate someone else’s way of thinking or acting into your own way of thinking or acting. Second, caring interrupts the self-serving mindset of focusing only on results.\nCollaboration is a lengthy process that should involve every team member who is affected by the results. According to the get stuff done wheel (Scott 2019), there are seven steps to effective collaboration: listen, clarify, discuss, decide, persuade, execute, and learn. You should move through the steps quickly so that collaboration is perceived as a rewarding task rather than a chore, but not skip any step—the success of each step builds on the success of the previous one.\n\nListen\nYour job as a leader is to listen to every person on your team, with the goal of amplifying their voice.\nYou can apply quiet listening by inserting silence in your conversations in order to create space for the other person to speak. To be an effective quiet listener, focus on building conversations that make everyone feel comfortable. But be aware that people may waste their time trying to guess what you want, or present their own ideas as yours in meetings or conversations.\nLoud listening, in contrast, is about saying things that will cause the other person to react or counter—this usually happens when you express a firm opinion and ask for a response. The advantage of this method is that no one wastes time trying to figure out what you think - it is very clear. Besides, this way you quickly get to the bottom of opposing points of view and logic holes. You can encourage the confidence to challenge by stating your idea clearly, and then explicitly asking that the other person challenges your idea.\n\n\nClarify\nGood thinking often needs clarification. It can be provided by brainstorming, when you quickly differentiate between good and bad ideas, or a 1:1 conversation, when you discuss the details without any judgment in a friendly environment.\nIt’s also crucial to remind you an your team that when presenting an idea, it’s the presenters responsibility to make sure everyone understands—not the other way around.\n\n\nDebate\nIt must be a discussion where “individual egos and self-interest don’t get in the way of an objective quest for the best answer.” Debates take time and emotional energy, but are very productive.\n\nMake sure ego doesn’t get in the way of good ideas. Set clear rules before debates, such as no interruptions or no criticism without an idea of your own. Reject anyone who puts forth an idea as “theirs” instead of involving the whole team, or who uses the opinions of absent people to support their opinions.\nExpect disagreement. A good debate doesn’t happen when everyone at the table agrees - make it clear that you expect someone to look at the issue from a different perspective.\nIt is your job to know your team members well enough to recognize when they’re approaching that point, pause the debate, and decide when to resume it.\nKnow your audience. Realize that there may be team members who don’t like debates. Make the goals and expectations of the debate clear from the beginning to reduce discomfort with the debate.\nSet a deadline for your decision** Everyone must have the same expectations for when a decision will be made.\nDon’t make a decision just to end the debate. Don’t take work away from your team by making quick decisions.\n\n\n\nDeciding\nWhen it comes time to make a decision, make sure the right people are the decision-makers. Keep in mind that the most senior people—and you, as the boss—are often considered decision-makers, but they are not necessarily the people with the best information. Your decision-makers should be those who are close to the facts surrounding a situation, and thus have the best possible information to make a decision.\n\n\nPersuading\nIt might feel pointless to put effort into persuading people to go along with a decision once you have already made it, but it’s critical that everyone who will be helping you execute the decision is persuaded of its value—skipping this step leaves key people feeling unimportant and disconnected. Moreover, it is not enough to explain the mere logic: you will have to appeal to people’s emotions, as well as focus on your past accomplishments.\n\n\nExecuting\nDo not get far away from the people executing the task. Be a part of the team.\n\n\nLearn\nIt takes a huge amount of discipline to take a pause and step back to actually learn from your experience. However, it’s crucial to examine results and note the ways that the collaborative process could have gone more smoothly or been improved, because this is where growth happens."

How will individual employees and outcomes be evaluated? Will failure harm motivation and self-efficacy?\nProvide skills and training to enable employees to reach goals. Avoid harsh punishment for failure to reach a goal.\n\n\nWho sets the goals?\nPeople will become more committed to goals they help to set. At the same time, people may be tempted to set easy-to-reach goals.\nAllow transparency in the goal-setting process and involve more than one person or unit.\n\n\nIs the time horizon appropriate?\nShort-term goals may harm long-term performance.\nBe sure that short-term efforts to reach a goal do not harm investment in long-term outcomes.\n\n\nHow might goals influence risk taking?\nUnmet goals may induce risk taking.\nBe sure to articulate acceptable levels of risk.\n\n\nHow might goals motivate unethical behavior?\nGoals narrow focus. Employees with goals are less likely to recognize ethical issues, and more likely to rationalize their unethical behavior.\nMultiple safeguards may be necessary to ensure ethical behavior while attaining goals (e.g., leaders as exemplars of ethical behavior, making the costs of cheating far greater than the benefit, strong oversight).\n\n\nCan goals be idiosyncratically tailored for individual abilities and circumstances while preserving fairness?\nIndividual differences may make standardized goals inappropriate, yet unequal goals may be unfair.\nIf possible, strive to set goals that use common standards and account for individual variation.\n\n\nHow will goals influence organizational culture?\nIndividual goals may harm cooperation and corrode organizational culture.\nIf cooperation is essential, consider setting team-based rather than individual goals.Think carefully about the values that the specific, challenging goals convey.\n\n\nAre individuals intrinsically motivated?\nGoal setting can harm intrinsic motivation.\nAssess intrinsic motivation and avoid setting goals when intrinsic motivation is high.\n\n\nWhat type of goal (performance or learning) is most appropriate given the ultimate objectives of the organization?\nBy focusing on performance goals, employees may fail to search for better strategies and fail to learn.\nIn complex, changing environments, learning goals may be more effective than performance goals."

The problem of reading a bar code is an extremely limited and artificial form of visual interpretation, and it has been carefully designed to be as simple as possible, given the hardware.\nThe problem of determining the relevance of a web page to a query is a problem in natural language understanding, and the techniques are related to those we will discuss later. Search engines also use clustering techniques. Likewise, other functionalities provided by a search engines use intelligent techniques; for instance, the spelling corrector uses a form of data mining based on observing users’ corrections of their own spelling errors. On the other hand, the problem of indexing billions of web pages in a way that allows retrieval in seconds is a problem in database design, not in artificial intelligence.\nTo a limited extent. Voice-activated telephone menus tend to use vocabularies which are very limited – e.g. the digits, “Yes”, and “No” — and within the designers’ control, which greatly simplifies the problem. On the other hand, the programs must deal with an uncontrolled space of all kinds of voices and accents. Modern digital assistants like Siri and the Google Assistant make more use of artificial intelligence techniques, but still have a limited repetoire.\nInternet routing algorithms are borderline. There is something to be said for viewing these as intelligent agents working in cyberspace. The task is sophisticated, the information available is partial, the techniques are heuristic (not guaranteed optimal), and the state of the world is dynamic. All of these are characteristic of intelligent activities. On the other hand, the task is very far from those normally carried out in human cognition. In recent years there have been suggestions to base more core algorithmic work on machine learning."

Anyone who has written a program with an ornery bug knows this, as does anyone who has written a successful machine learning program. So in one sense Samuel “told” the computer “learn to play checkers better than I do, and then play that way,” but in another sense he told the computer “follow this learning algorithm” and it learned to play. So we’re left in the situation where you may or may not consider learning to play checkers to be a sign of intelligence (or you may think that learning to play in the right way requires intelligence, but not in this way), and you may think the intelligence resides in the programmer or in the computer.\n\nSurely animals cannot be intelligent\n—they can do only what their genes tell them.\n\nThe point of this exercise is to notice the parallel with the previous one. Whatever you decided about whether computers could be intelligent in 1.11, you are committed to making the same conclusion about animals (including humans), unless your reasons for deciding whether something is intelligent take into account the mechanism (programming via genes versus programming via a human programmer).\n\nSurely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent\n—they can do only what their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physics.\n\nAgain, your definition of “intelligent” drives your answer to this question."

An agent that only senses partial information could be rational, consider an agent whose performance measure is based on its ability to stay completely static in an environment where there are no other agents, such an agent could be perfectly rational even if it did not have any sensors at all. Granted, such an agent would not be very interesting but it would indeed be rational.\n\n\n\nThere exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.\n\nTrue. A pure reflex agent ignores previous percepts, so cannot obtain an optimal state estimate in a partially observable environment. Consider a partially unobservable task environment where the performance measure is based on the agent’s extent of exploration. Now assume that this agent is purely reflex, only responding when it’s world state changes, since its performance measure is to explore but its actions are conditional upon change around it then the agent waits for its state to change but it never will because it is the agent’s entire job is to change its state.\n\n\n\nThere exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.\n\nTrue. Consider an environment that disables all agent’s actuators, rendering them immobile (e.g., an environment with a single state). Regardless of what performance measures these agents possessed they are still judged as rational because they are physically incapable of performing anything.\n\n\n\nEvery agent is rational in an unobservable environment.\n\nFalse. Some actions are stupid—and the agent may know this if it has a model of the environment—even if one cannot perceive the environment state.\n\n\n\nThere is a model-based reflex agent that can remember all of its percepts.\n\nTrue. There could be one, but usually, it keeps the model. A model-based reflex agent is one that uses internal memory and a percept history to create a model of the environment in which it’s operating and make decisions based on that model. The term percept means something that has been observed or detected by the agent. The model-based reflex agent stores the past percepts in its memory and uses them to create a model of the environment. The agent then uses this model to determine which action should be taken in any given situation.\n\n\n\nA perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.\n\nFalse. Due to the partially observable, multi-agent, stochastic, sequential, static and discrete nature of poker, even a perfectly rational agent could not possibly win every game unless the agent is completely omniscient, there are too many factors contributing to the complexity of the task environment that are beyond the agent’s scope of influence. Although, these things are true, let us not discount the fact that the agent could be a learning agent and improve its ability to play but it would still probably lose."

There might be a slight influence from “provenance” information (date, authorship, etc.) that may not be directly observable.\nSkin cancer diagnosis can sometimes be done well from an image of the lesion, bot other factors such as patient age, changes in the lesion over time, medical history, and family history can be important.\nDriving is often considered to be observable because we imagine that we are making decisions based on what we see, but (1) velocity and turn signal status of other vehicles can be judged only from multiple image frames, and (2) assessing the intended actions of other vehicles may require accumulating information over an extended period—e.g., to determine if a vehicle is stopped or broken down, driving slowly or looking for an address or a parking spot, turning left or has forgotten to turn off the turn signal. Other vehicles, hedges, fog, and so on can obscure visual access to important aspects of the driving environment.\nTutoring is almost completely unobservable: what matters is the student’s level of understanding, learning style, basic math skills, etc. clues must be gathered over days, weeks, and months.\n\nContinuous: climate engineering &gt; driving &gt; spoken conversation &gt; written conversation.\n\nClimate engineering by aerosol injection is quintessentially continuous: the engineer must decide how much to inject, where, and when, and all of these are continuous quantities.\nThe control actions of driving are mostly continuous (steering, acceleration/ braking) but there are discrete elements (turn signal, headlights). More importantly, the problem is usually handled using discrete high-level actions (change lanes left, take exit, etc.) that have implementations as continuous control problems. This kind of discrete/ continuous hierarchy is very common; playing chess in the physical world is a perfect example.\nSpoken conversation is closer to chess than driving: roughly speaking, we choose the discrete words to say and delegate the saying to continuous motor control routines. Prosody (volume, pitch, and speed variation) is, however, an important continuous element in how we speak that is largely absent from written communication.\n\nStochastic: poker &gt; soccer &gt; driving &gt; sudoku.\n\nIn poker, nearly everything is determined by the fall of the cards, which is entirely stochastic from the viewpoint of the players.\nBoth soccer and driving contain elements that are fairly deterministic, such as the flight of the ball and the response of the engine, and elements that are stochastic, such as tire punctures and the outcomes of tackles. Yet typically one can make reasonably reliable driving plans over many minutes, whereas it is essentially impossible to predict the state of a soccer game one minute into the future. Sudoku, of course, is entirely deterministic.\n\nStatic: tax planning &gt; checkers &gt; chat room &gt; tennis.\n\nWhile no human activity is completely static, given the finite length of our lifetimes, tax planning comes close—the typical “deadline” to get it done is often weeks or months, and the relevant aspects of the environment (life/death, number of offspring, tax law) may change even more slowly.\nIn checkers, the world state doesn’t change until someone moves, but the clock ticks so the problem is semi-dynamic.\nIn the chat room, long delays in replying are unacceptable, so it is a fairly real-time environment, but not nearly as real-time as tennis, where a delay of a split second often makes the difference between winning and losing a point."

    "text": "I2AI_7 E1\nThe first step is to appreciate the variety of knowledge that goes under the heading “language.”\nThe infant must learn to recognize and produce speech, learn vocabulary, learn grammar, learn the semantic and pragmatic interpretation of a speech act, and learn strategies for disambiguation, among other things.\nThe performance elements for this (in humans) and their associated learning mechanisms are obviously very complex and as yet little is known about them.\nA naive model of the learning environment considers just the exchange of speech sounds. In reality, the physical context of each utterance is crucial: a child must see the context in which “watermelon” is uttered in order to learn to associate “watermelon” with watermelons.\nThus, the environment consists not just of other humans but also the physical objects and events about which discourse takes place. Auditory sensors detect speech sounds, while other senses (primarily visual) provide information on the physical context. The relevant effectors are the speech organs and the motor capacities that allow the infant to respond to speech or that elicit verbal feedback.\nThe performance standard could simply be the infant’s general utility function, however that is realized, so that the infant performs reinforcement learning to perform and respond to speech acts so as to improve its well-being—for example, by obtaining food and attention.\nHowever, humans’ built-in capacity for mimicry suggests that the production of sounds similar to those produced by other humans is a goal in itself. The child (once he or she learns to differentiate sounds and learn about pointing or other means of indicating salient objects) is also exposed to examples of supervised learning: an adult says “shoe” or “belly button” while indicating the appropriate object. So sentences produced by adults provide labelled positive examples, and the response of adults to the infant’s speech acts provides further classification feedback.\nMostly, it seems that adults do not correct the child’s speech, so there are very few negative classifications of the child’s attempted sentences. This is significant because early work on language learning, such as the work of Gold (1967) concentrated just on identifying the set of strings that are grammatical, assuming a particular grammatical formalism. If there are only positive examples, then there is nothing to rule out the grammar \\(S \\implies Word\\). Some theorists (notably Chomsky and Fodor) used what they call the “poverty of the stimulus” argument to say that the basic universal grammar of languages must be innate, because otherwise (given the lack of negative examples) there would be no way that a child could learn a language (under the assumptions of language learning as learning a set of grammatical strings). Critics have called this the “poverty of the imagination” argument—I can’t think of a learning mechanism that would work, so it must be innate. Indeed, if we go to probabilistic context free grammars, then it is possible to learn a language without negative examples.\n\nWhat with learning tennis?\nLearning tennis is much simpler than learning to speak. The requisite skills can be divided into movement, playing strokes, and strategy.\nThe environment consists of the court, ball, opponent, and one’s own body. The relevant sensors are the visual system and proprioception (the sense of forces on and position of one’s own body parts). The effectors are the muscles involved in moving to the ball and hitting the stroke.\nThe learning process involves both supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning occurs in acquiring the predictive transition models, e.g., where the opponent will hit the ball, where the ball will land, and what trajectory the ball will have after one’s own stroke (e.g., if I hit a half-volley this way, it goes into the net, but if I hit it that way, it clears the net).\nReinforcement learning occurs when points are won and lost—this is particularly important for strategic aspects of play such as shot placement and positioning (e.g., in 60% of the points where I hit a lob in response to a cross-court shot, I end up losing the point).\nIn the early stages, reinforcement also occurs when a shot succeeds in clearing the net and landing in the opponent’s court. Achieving this small success is itself a sequential process involving many motor control commands, and there is no teacher available to tell the learner’s motor cortex which motor control commands to issue."

Temperatursensoren) und Aktoren (bspw. Heizung) im Haus bzw. in der Wohnung ein prominentes Beispiel.\nDiese Art der technologischen Vernetzung von Geräten und Daten ermöglicht völlig Arten der Wertschöpfung."

Alle Funktionen der Anwendung können produktiv genutzt werden. Es kommt idealerweise zu einem weiteren Anstieg der Nutzung, sofern es sich nicht um eine Anwendung mit beschränktem Benutzerkreis handelt.\nSättigung/Reife: In dieser Phase erreicht die Nutzung ihren Höhepunkt. Bisherige Nutzer können keine weiteren Nutzungsmöglichkeiten entdecken und weitere Nutzer kommen nicht mehr hinzu. Ein Nutzungsrückgang kann dadurch verursacht werden, dass das System nicht mehr dem Stand der Technik entspricht, mit anderen, zeitlich nachgelagert eingeführten, Systemen konkurriert oder die Menge und Bedeutung der unterstützten Aufgaben zurückgeht.\nRückgang: Der in der Phase Sättigung/Reife einsetzende Nutzungsrückgang setzt sich fort.\nAbschaffung: In dieser Phase wird die Entscheidung getroffen, zu welchem Zeitpunkt ein System abgeschafft oder durch ein neues System abgelöst wird.

    "text": "Complexities (competing values)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The competing values in a framework based on Quinn (1988)\n\n\nThe creator of the competing values framework (CVF), Quinn (1988) argues that top managers and leaders are better able to recognize and deal with contradictions and paradoxes that often manifest themselves in the form of conflict, unconstructive conversations and misalignment of leadership and management capacity with an organisation’s strategic challenges. He identified multiple competing demands and views between members within the organization and across various levels of the organization. He showed that these reflect different values of individuals and often different cultures which had become embedded in parts of and across organizations. Quinn (1988) set out his attempt to develop an integrating framework that could capture these in a meaningful way, with different mixes of paradoxes and contradictions at each point in time, and to show how individuals and organisations could better appreciate the circumstances and move forward.\nQuinn (1988) distilled the competing values in a framework with two dimensions and resulting four quadrants. The dimensions express the tensions or competing values that characterize all organisations. One axis represents the continuum between flexibility or adaptability and stability or control. The other axis describes the continuum between efficient internal processes, such as human resource practices or internal control systems, and external positioning vis-à-vis stakeholders such as competitors, customers and clients. Each continuum highlights performance criteria that are opposite to the other end of the continuum, such as internal versus external alignment (horizontal axis) or flexibility versus stability (vertical axis).\nThe main characteristics of the clan culture, so called because it resembles a family-like orientation, include empowerment, team building and employee participation; the main characteristics of the adhocracy culture include adaptability, creativity and risk-taking; this type of culture is often found in innovative industries. The main characteristics of hierarchy culture include standardisation, predictability and multiple levels of management; the authors suggest that this type of culture is usually found in government agencies. Finally, Cameron and Quinn (2006) suggest that market culture, with its characteristic outward orientation and competitive attitude, is often found in organisations operating in unstable and crowded operating environments.\nThe four orientations are intuitively appealing, perhaps confirming their origin in psychological archetypes; most people can probably find the culture of their current organisation somewhere in this taxonomy. However, as the academic labels for thein each quadrant are often misunderstood, it has proven useful to substitute more accessible and commonly used verbs to describe the dominant activities that relate to each culture—collaborate, create, compete, and control (Lavine 2014).\nThe model further groups two of the leadership roles in each of the four quadrants. The upper right quadrant, which the framework links to open systems theory and the process of adapting to the external environment of the organisation, defines two leadership roles:\n\nThe innovator is creative and surrounds, encourages and facilitates change.\nThe broker is politically astute, acquires resources and maintains the external legitimacy of the entity by building, scanning and maintaining a network of external contacts.\n\nMoving clockwise to the lower right quadrant, two other leadership roles are specified. These roles emphasize the rational pursuit of goals that are external to the group and the role of the leader in defining and motivating the achievement of these goals.\n\nThe producer is the task-oriented, work-driven role. The producer seeks closure and motivates the behaviors that lead to the completion of the group task\nThe director sets goals, clarifies the role, sets targets and formulates clear expectations.\n\nThe lower left quadrant is called the internal process model and focuses on internal control and stability. Two additional leadership roles are defined in this quadrant:\n\nThe coordinator maintains the structure, plans, coordinates and resolves problems, and ensures compliance with rules and standards.\nThe monitor collects and distributes information, reviews performance and ensures continuity and stability.\n\nThe upper left quadrant is referred to in the framework as the human relations quadrant, which focuses on human interaction and process. Within this quadrant, two final leadership roles are defined:\n\nThe facilitator encourages the expression of opinions, seeks consensus and negotiates compromises.\nThe mentor is aware of individual needs, actively listens, is fair, supports legitimate concerns and seeks to promote the development of the individual."

Often organizations need both stability and change at the same time. In contrast to earlier approaches, the development of the competing values framework did not assume that stability and change were mutually exclusive, an either/or decision. Quinn et al. (2020, p. 12)\n\nLeadership qualities seem to be best demonstrated by more movement throughout the framework, suggesting complex adaptation to changing circumstances (Denison, Hooijberg, and Quinn 1995).\nThe CVF provides a description of roles and behaviors to encourage self-reflection and to provide a preliminary sense of behaviors and accompanying roles that can be learned.\nWorking to overcome areas of relative weakness so that they can be transformed into average or adequate performance can help leaders see more opportunities for action when core areas of strength are not delivering the desired results."

(2002)\n\n\n\nLeadership effectiveness refers to a leader’s performance in influencing and guiding the activities of his or her unit toward achievement of its goals (Stogdill 1950).\nLeadership emergence refers to whether (or to what degree) an individual is viewed as a leader by others, who typically have only limited information about that individual’s performance (Hogan, Curphy, and Hogan 1994).\nLeadership effectiveness and emergence represent two levels of analysis. Leadership emergence is a within-group phenomenon. In contrast, leadership effectiveness represents a between-groups phenomenon.\nRegarding these two constructs and personality trais, the meta-analysis of Judge et al. (2002) shows that:\n\nThe Big Five typology is a fruitful basis for examining the dispositional predictors of leadership.\nExtraversion is the most important trait of leaders and effective leadership.\nExtraversion is more strongly related to leader emergence than to leader effectiveness.\nAfter Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience were the strongest and most consistent correlates of leadership.\nConscientiousness ist more strongly related to leader emergence than to leadership effectiveness.\nAgreeableness was the least relevant trait.\nNeuroticism failed to emerge as a significant predictor of leadership.\nOverall, the traits are better predictors in situations in which individuals have only limited opportunity to observe leadership behaviors (i.e., student samples).\n\nHowever, the results may simply indicate a close correspondence between the way we see peoples personalities and our stereotypical conceptions of the characteristics of leaders."

As adaptive and coordination problems increase, so does the importance of leadership. There is little need for prudent, courageous and flexible leadership when the collective faces little conflict from within or without."

    "text": "Production\nCrowdsourcing challenges may range from calls for incremental innovation such as improvements in existing product lines (e.g., Lego World Builder) or to calls for radical innovation such as developing entirely new service models (e.g., OpenIDEO) (Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013, 259).\nDesign choices in the production dimensions include:\n\n\nType of contribution (text, images, etc.)\nSelection-process (e.g., up-voting possibility)\nNature and type of discussions (e.g., moderated)\nChallenge journey (e.g., state gate journey)\n\n\n\nWeb-based crowdsourcing architectures usually require participants to submit their ideas in the form of text (as in the IBM Innovation Jam discussion forums) or in the form of product design specifications (as in Lego Mindstorms). Posting the idea opens a discussion thread. Subsequent participants can then either contribute by adding comments to a posted idea, or post their own idea to start a new discussion thread. In the various crowdsourcing experiences, there may be little discussion of an idea (as in Heineken’s Beer Challenge) or there may be many comments and responses (as in Threadless). Because the architectures generally require that an idea be posted to start a discussion (rather than posting facts or some other generative response), the discussion is usually focused on refining a posted idea and rarely on recombining existing posts into new ideas. As a result, ideas are rarely significantly changed by combination and recombination. These discussions can be moderated or not (Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013, 259).\nAnother variation of the architecture for innovation production in crowdsourcing is the way the crowd votes: In many architectures, the crowd is asked to vote on each idea submitted, which accelarates the cycle times. Without voting on the crowd’s most preferred ideas, it would take a sponsoring organization countless hours to review each idea, while the crowd voting speeds up the evaluation of experimental ideas (Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013, 259)."

    "text": "Co-creation boundary management\nCo-creation boundary management refers to the basis by which individuals with certain identities are given preference over others when encouraging participation including incentive structures and intellectual property protections (Jarvenpaa and Lang 2011).\nMajchrzak and Malhotra (2013, 259) distinguish between outcome-based crowdsourcing and contribution-based crowdsourcing architectures.\n\n\nIn outcome-based crowdsourcing the best idea wins and its contributor is awarded with an extrinsic prize. The crowdsourcing effort is then usually referred to as an innovation tournament or innovation contest or idea tournament.\nIn contribution-based crowdsourcing, incentives are given for the process by which the crowd participates in the crowdsourcing challenge (e.g., the number of comments on others’ ideas). Depending on the type of production process being promoted, the sponsoring organization may be particularly concerned with encouraging sufficient crowd activity on the crowdsourcing platform. In this case, incentives can be created based on the number of published contributions. These incentives may be for the best contributor in terms of number of posts or number of ideas posted.\n\n\nIn for-profit crowdsourcing projects, both types usually include that the members exchange IP for the opportunity to win a prize.\n\nParticipants are often informed that, when the sponsor is a for-profit entity and the crowd is the general public, the sponsoring company owns all intellectual rights. Essentially, members of the crowd are giving up their intellectual property rights in exchange for the opportunity to win the prizes. In contrast, with ‘‘captive’’ or ‘‘closed’’ communities in which individuals have been specially selected to be a member of the community because of their interests and expertise, winners often retain some intellectual property Majchrzak and Malhotra (2013)]."

This allows, for instance, human domain experts to deal with so called ‘‘broken-leg’’ predictions that deviate from the currently known probability distribution. However, they are restricted by bound rationality that prevents them from aggregating information perfectly and drawing conclusions from that. On the other hand, machines are particularly good at solving repetitive tasks that require fast processing of huge amounts of data, at recognizing complex patterns, or weighing multiple factors following consistent rules of probability theory (Dellermann et al. 2019).\nHowever, there is also a technology-centric perspective that assumes that true intelligence can ultimately only be found in well-developed and mature (general) AI systems. Humans are biologically limited in their information processing and reasoning abilities and exhibit many types of cognitive biases, while computers offer virtually infinite possibilities to develop rational intelligence at human levels and beyond (Peeters et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel of human cognition\n\n\n\nKahneman (2011) proposed a two-system model of human cognition, which he called System 1 and System 2.\nSystem 1 is an intuitive, automatic, and fast mode of thinking that operates outside of our conscious awareness. It is responsible for generating impressions, making quick judgments, and executing routine tasks with minimal effort.\nSystem 2, on the other hand, is a more analytical, controlled, and deliberate mode of thinking that requires conscious effort and attention. It is responsible for problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making.\nWhile System 1 operates quickly and automatically, it can be prone to biases and errors, particularly in complex or unfamiliar situations. System 2, though slower and more effortful, can help us avoid these biases and make more accurate decisions."

    "text": "Motivation\n\nSociety often associates leaders with individuals that have grandiose titles, a large corner office, and make world-changing decisions. Thus, many people shy away from identifying themselves as a leader. However, real leadership can be seen most clearly in the small moments throughout the day.\n\nLeadership is about behaving in a way that makes the life of another person better than before you arrived. Drew Dudley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral remarks\nThis module helps you to deepen your understanding of the requirements of leadership in the digital age — from leading oneself, to leading employees and leading systems.\nTo achieve that, you will read a bunch of scientific papers, apply some of the findings in (group) exercises and, best case, reflect your own behavior.\nAs a graded exam assignment, you will research a theory/theoretical construct related to leadership, explain it to the class, and critically discuss its value to leadership practice.\nIt is very important that you prepare yourself for the classes (see Table 1 for details).\n\n\nContents\nThe following topics will be discussed in order to identify and reflect on challenges and opportunities in different leadership roles and situations:\n\n\nChallenges of leading in the digital age (e.g., VUCA, role of technology, etc.)\nBasics of leadership (e.g., motivation, leadership characteristics, etc.)\nTheories (e.g., resources and demand theory, identities at work, trust, psychological safety, etc.)\nDigital leadership tools (workshop tactics and storytelling, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nDuring this course, you should improve your ability to consciously use, reflect on and further develop your leadership skills in your day-to-day work, in particular with regard to\n\n\nLeadership requirements in the context of digital transformation,\nIdentification of and reflection on challenges and opportunities in your own leadership role,\nUnderstanding of the facets of different personality types,\nBasic understanding of characteristics of sustainable organizational systems, and\nLead hierarchically and laterally using digital leadership tools.\n\n\n\n\nEffort\nYou will gain 5 ECTS for this course. This equals approx. 150 hours workload, of which you need most to pass the course.\n\n\nClasses (approx. 30 hours)\nPreparation and follow-up (approx. 15 hours)\nPreparation of the presentation (remaining time)\n\n\n\nPlease prepare your schedule accordingly.\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\nIt is of importance that you prepare yourself for the sessions and work on the case study continually.

Those who stay on the left side will have many ideas and possibilities to work with, but they will not be able to turn them into new and useful solutions; instead, conflict and chaos will reign. The correct position at any given time will depend on the circumstances. However, the goal will always be to take the position that enables the collaboration, experimentation and integration that are necessary for innovation.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Paradoxes of innovation according to Linda A.

Why does this problem exist? Who is contributing to it? This begins to isolate the main problem within the story.\nOpportunity: What is the impact or opportunity for your organisation? This is what some people call an unmet need or an aha moment. This is something you can use to bring about change or to address and solve a problem.\nApproach: How does your story unfold? What are the three or four characters or key elements? What is the how, where and when?\nResolution: All good stories have an ending or conclusion. How do you resolve the build-up from the beginning? Let’s say your story is about innovation and there are four ways the company will create something new. What is the benefit to a customer, an employee, the industry or the community? Where does this story end? Who sees the benefits?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The structure of a marker story"

    "text": "Business Engineering\nZur Wiederholung und Einordnung: Unter Business Engineering versteht man die ingenieurmäßige Vorgehensweise bei der Gestaltung eines Unternehmens.\nBusiness Engineering überspannt den kompletten Prozess von der Strategiefindung und der Ableitung von Geschäftsmodellen bis zur optimalen Gestaltung der Abläufe sowie zugehöriger Anwendungssysteme (Abts und Mülder 2017; Leimeister 2021).\nDas Business Engineering Modell kann somit um die Ebene des Geschäftsmodells ergänzt werden (Al-Debei und Avison 2010).\n\nIn der Praxis sind die Begriffe Strategie und Geschäftsmodell oft nicht eindeutig abgegrenzt, was zu einem erschwerten Begriffsverständnis und oftmals auch Verständnisschwierigkeiten beiträgt. Der wissenschaftliche Diskurs zeigt jedoch, dass die Strategie und das Geschäftsmodell eines Unternehmens nicht identisch sind, sondern sich voneinander unterscheiden.\nEine Unternehmensstrategie legt langfristige Ziele sowie grundsätzliche Maßnahmen fest, diese zu erreichen. Basis für die langfristige Ausrichtung eines Unternehmens sind sowohl dessen interne Stärken und Schwächen als auch die unternehmensexternen Chancen und Risiken der Umwelt. Die Stärken eines Unternehmens sollen mit den Chancen der Umwelt in Einklang gebracht werden, wobei gleichzeitig die eigenen Schwächen verringert und die externen Risiken vermieden werden sollen. Kurzum: Strategie beschreibt, wie sich ein Unternehmen gegenüber Konkurrenten durchsetzen kann.\nDahingegen beschreibt das Geschäftsmodell auf abstrakter Ebene wie die Unternehmensressourcen so koordiniert werden, so dass Wert geschaffen wird oder in Zukunft geschaffen werden soll. Aus dem Geschäftsmodell lassen sich dann die spezifischen Geschäftsprozesse ableiten. Diese beschreiben im Detail, wie mit Hilfe von Tätigkeitsketten aus verschiedenen Produktionsfaktoren (Input) ein spezifisches Ergebnis (Output) erzeugt wird.\nStrategien unterscheiden sich von Geschäftsmodellen also insbesondere darin, dass Strategien zukunftsorientiert sind und eine langfristige Perspektive verfolgen, wohingegen Geschäftsmodelle eher gegenwartsbezogen sind und die aktuelle Logik zur Erzeugung von Wert beschreiben. Eine Strategie kann zu unterschiedlichen Geschäftsmodellen führen, ein Geschäftsmodell ist deshalb nur eine mögliche Abbildung der Strategie.\nDas Unternehmen, die eine gleiche Strategie verfolgen, diese durch unterschiedliche Geschäftsmodelle umsetzen können zeigt sich unter anderem bei Fluggesellschaften. Fluggesellschaften wie Ryanair und Eurowings verfolgen eine Wettbewerbsstrategie, die als Preisführerschaft bezeichnet wird (low-cost Airlines). Die Unternehmen unterscheiden sich aber in der Art und Weise, wie sie ihr Geschäftsmodell konzipiert haben. Unterschiede lassen sich z.B. hinsichtlich des Partnernetzwerkes (Eurowings ist Teil der Lufthansa Gruppe), des Codesharings, sowie des Kundenservices feststellen."

Diese Dimension beschreibt, welche Kunden(segmente) anvisiert werden, was die Produkte und Dienstleistungen für die Kunden wertvoll macht und wie die Kunden gewonnen und gehalten werden sollen. IT spielt in diese Dimension eine zunehmend entscheidende Rolle.\nDie Wertschöpfungsarchitektur beschreibt, wie das Wertversprechen organisatorisch und technologisch durch das Unternehmen erstellt wird, also wie die Organisation, die Ressourcen und die Kernkompetenzen eines Unternehmens zusammenspielen.\nDas Partnernetzwerk nimmt eine unternehmensübergreifende Perspektive ein und beschreibt, wie Kunden und weitere Partner in die Wertschöpfungserstellung eingebunden sind und zusammenarbeiten. Diese Dimension zeigt damit auch die Rollen der verschiedenen Akteure und wie Wert zwischen diesen ausgetauscht wird.\nDas Ertragsmodell beschreibt, wie das Unternehmen Einnahmen generiert und welche Kosten diesen gegenüberstehen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension\nKlassisches Geschäftsmodell\nDigitales Geschäftsmodell\n\n\n\n\nWertversprechen\n(Physisches) Produkt und Services; limitierte Kundenintegration\nDatengetriebene Services generieren Wert; tiefe Kundenintegration\n\n\nWertschöpfungsarchitektur\nTraditionelle Wertschöpfungsprozesse („value chain“) und Kanäle\nDatenbasierte und Plattform-orientierte Wertschöpfung\n\n\nPartnernetzwerk\nAkteure entlang der Wertschöpfungskette und zusätzliche Dienstleister\nErweitertes Ökosystem (Wettbewerber, Politik, Wissenschaft, etc.)\n\n\nFinanzstruktur\nKosten für Ressourcen und Dienstleistung; Erlöse über Verkauf\nAufbau und Betrieb der Plattform; Erlöse im „as-a-service“-Bezahlmodell"

Reicht es nicht aus, sich auf die Strategie und die Geschäftsprozesse zu fokussieren?\nRichtig ist, dass es Schnittmengen zwischen Geschäftsstrategie, Geschäftsmodell und Geschäftsprozessen gibt. Jedoch stellen Geschäftsstrategie, -modell und -prozesse verschiedene Informationsebenen dar, die für unterschiedliche Zwecke nützlich sind. Das Geschäftsmodell kann als eine Schnittstelle zwischen der Unternehmensstrategie und den Geschäftsprozessen sowie der unterstützenden Informationssysteme betrachtet werden.\nDie Geschäftsstrategie stellt die Entscheidungen dar, die Unternehmen treffen, um besser abzuschneiden als ihre Konkurrenten. Das Geschäftsmodell beschreibt, wie die Teile eines Unternehmens zusammenspielen, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen.\nInsbesondere in einem Umfeld, das sich durch ein hohes Maß an Komplexität und schnellem Wandel kennzeichnet, sind Unternehmen verstärkt darauf angewiesen, das Potenzial eines Unternehmens (Organisation und Technologie) mit dem Plan zur Realisierung von wirtschaftlichen Werten (Strategie) zu verbinden. Diese Brücke stellt das Geschäftsmodell dar.\nDas Geschäftsmodell wird somit zu einer Art Blaupause für die Art und Weise, wie ein Unternehmen aus neuen Dienstleistungen, Produkten oder Innovationen Wert schafft. Analog zu den Überlegungen im Kapitel IT-Management lässt sich daraus schlussfolgern, dass heute nicht die Technologien, sondern die sinnvolle Nutzung und Kombination dieser Technologien den Erfolg von Unternehmen bestimmen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeschäftsmodell\nStrategie\n\n\n\n\nOrientierung\nKundennutzen und (kooperativen) Wertschöpfung\nWettbewerb, Umfeld und Branchenlogik\n\n\nZielsetzung\nUmsetzung von Strategien; nachhaltige Unternehmenssicherung; kontinuierliche Anpassung/Innovation des Geschäftsmodells\nAufbau und Aufrechterhaltung von Wettbewerbsvorteilen, um den Erfolg zu sichern; Differenzierung gegenüber dem Wettbewerb; Anpassung an das sich ständig wandelnde Umfeld\n\n\nInhalt\nBeschreibung der Wertschöpfung über Wertversprechen, Wertschöpfungsarchitektur, Partnernetzwerk und Ertragsmodell; Anpassungsmöglichkeiten an interne und externe Veränderungen\nLangfristiges Ziel und Richtung; umfassende Ist-Analyse und bewusste Planung der zukünftigen Aktivitäten unter Berücksichtigung externer und interner Faktoren (bspw.

Beispiel: Produktentwicklung.\nUnterstützungsprozesse erzeugen Leistungen für interne Kunden und ermöglichen den reibungslosen Ablauf der Kernprozesse. Sie haben keine strategische Bedeutung. Beispiel: Lohn- und Gehaltsabrechnung.\nIn Unternehmen, die entlang der Wertschöpfungskette organisiert sind, durchlaufen sowohl Kernprozesse als auch Unterstützungsprozesse in der Regel meist mehrere organisatorischen Einheiten (oft Abteilungen). Die Prozesse sind also „abteilungsübergreifend”. Die Optimierung solcher Prozesse erfordert prozessorientierte Denken. Im Kontrast zum funktionalen Denken, das sich mit den Aufgaben des eigenen Funktionsbereichs beschäftigt, umfasst prozessorientiertes Denken die gesamte Prozesskette, ggf. auch über mehrere Abteilungen oder Bereiche hinweg.\n\nEin typisches Beispiel für die unterschiedliche Sichtweise von Prozess- und Funktionsdenken ist die Beschaffung von Waren und Dienstleistungen. Im Rahmen der Gestaltung der Beschaffungsabläufe tritt regelmäßig die Frage auf, welchem Bereich die Teilaufgabe der „Rechnungsprüfung” zugeordnet werden soll: der Logistik oder dem Rechnungswesen. Für den Bereich Logistik spricht, dass die Rechnungsprüfung die qualitative und mengenmäßige Kontrolle durchführt. Die Logistik verfolgt unter anderem das Ziel, die richtige Ware in der richtigen Menge und Qualität zur richtigen Zeit zum Empfänger zu transportieren. Das Rechnungswesen beansprucht oft die Verantwortung für die Überprüfung von Kontierungen und Zahlungsbedingungen. Das Rechnungswesen hat unter anderem das Ziel, eine ordnungsgemäße Bilanz und Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung aufzustellen. Wird der Prozess gesplittet, beispielsweise in der Art, dass zunächst die qualitative und Mengenkontrolle in der Logistik durchgeführt wird und später nach Weitergabe der Dokumente die kaufmännische bzw. finanztechnische Prüfung im Rechnungswesen erfolgt, sind fast zwangsläufig durch den Bearbeiterwechsel Verzögerungen zu erwarten."

    "text": "Figure 1: Agents interact with environments through sensors and actuators\n\n\n\nAn agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.\n\nThe term percept refers to the content an agent’s sensors are perceiving\nAn agent’s percept sequence is the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived\nThe agent function maps any given percept sequence to an action (an abstract mathematical description)\nThe agent function for an AI agent will be implemented by an agent program (a concrete implementation, running within some physical system)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nTo illustrate these ideas Russel and Norvig (2022, 55) use a simple example—the vacuum-cleaner world, which consists of a robotic vacuum-cleaning agent in a world consisting of squares that can be either dirty or clean. The vacuum agent perceives which square it is in and whether there is dirt in the square. The agent starts in square A. The available actions are to move to the right, move to the left, suck up the dirt, or do nothing. One very simple agent function is the following: if the current square is dirty, then suck; otherwise, move to the other square.\n\n\nAccording to Russel and Norvig (2022, 56), all areas of engineering can be seen as designing artifacts that interact with the world. AI operates at the most interesting end to the spectrum, where the artifacts have significant computational resources and the task environment requires nontrivial decision making.\n\n\n\n\nA rational agent is one that does the right thing.\n\n\nFor each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has (Russel and Norvig 2022, 58).\n\n\n\nWhat is rational at any given time depends on four things:\n\nThe performance measure that defines the criterion of success\nThe agent’s prior knowledge of the environment\nThe actions that the agent can performance\nThe agent’s percept sequence to date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nUnder following circumstances, the vacuum cleaning agent is rational:\n\nThe performance measure of the vacuum cleaner might award one point for each clean square at each time step, over a “lifetime” of 1,000 time steps (to prevent the cleaner to oscillate needlessly back and forth).\nThe “geography” of the environment is known a priori but the dirt distribution and the initial location of the agent are not. Clean squares stay clean and sucking cleans the current square. The Right and Left actions move the agent one square except when this would take the agent outside the environment in which case the agent remains where it is.\nThe only available action is Right, Left, and Suck.\nThe agent correctly perceives its location and whether that location contains dirt.\n\nFor details such as tabulated agent functions please see Russel and Norvig (2022).\n\n\n\n\nIt can be quite hard to formulate a performance measure correctly, however:\n\nIf we use, to achieve our purposes, a mechanical agency with those operation we cannot interfere once we have started it […] we had better be quite sure that the purpose built into the machine is the purpose which we really desire (Wiener 1960, 1358)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder which circumstances does a vacuum cleaning agent act rational?\n\n\n\n\nRationality is not the same as perfection.\n\n\nRationality maximizes expected performance\nPerfection maximizes actual performance\nPerfection requires omniscience\nRational choice depends only on the percept sequence to date\n\n\n\nAs the environment is usually not completely known a priori and completely predictable (or stable), information gathering and learning are important parts of rationality (Russel and Norvig 2022, 59).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nThe vacuum cleaner needs to explore an initially unknown environment (i.e., exploration) to maximize its expected performance. In addition, a vacuum cleaner that learns to predict where and when additional dirt will appear will do better than one that does not."

The vacuum agent perceives which square it is in and whether there is dirt in the square. The agent starts in square A. The available actions are to move to the right, move to the left, suck up the dirt, or do nothing. One very simple agent function is the following: if the current square is dirty, then suck; otherwise, move to the other square.\n\n\nAccording to Russel and Norvig (2022, 56), all areas of engineering can be seen as designing artifacts that interact with the world. AI operates at the most interesting end to the spectrum, where the artifacts have significant computational resources and the task environment requires nontrivial decision making."

It chooses the action that leads to the best expected utility, where expected utility is computed by averaging over all possible states, weighted by the probability of the outcome (Russel and Norvig 2022, 73).\nThe utility function is essentially an internalization of the performance measure.\nA utility-based agent has many advantages in terms of flexibility and learning, which are particularly helpful in environments characterized by partial observability and nondeterminism.\nIn addition, there are cases where the goals are insufficient but a utility-based agent can still make rational decisions based on the probabilities and the utilities of the outcomes:\n\nWhen there are conflicting goals, the utility function specifies the appropriate tradeoff.\nLikelihood of success (i.e., goal achievement) can be weighed against the importance of the goals\n\nModel- and utility-based agents are difficult to implement. They need to model and keep track of the task environment, which requires ingenious sensors, sophisticated algorithms, and a high computational complexity.\nThere are also utility-based agents that are not model-based. These agents just learn what action is best in a particular situation without any “understanding” of its impact on the environment (e.g., based on reinforcement learning).\n\nMain differences\nThe main difference between simple reflex agents and model-based reflex agents is that the latter keep track of the state of the world. Model-based reflex agents generate knowledge about how the world evolves independently of the agent and how actions of the agent change the world (i.e., they have knowledge about “how the world works”). This knowledge is “stored” in the transition model of the world. A model-based reflex agents still decides on condition-action rules which action to take (i.e., the codified reflexes).\nThe main difference between model-based reflex agents and goal-based agents is that it does not act on fixed condition-action rules, but on some sort of goal information that describes situations that are desirable (e.g., in the case of route-finding the destination). Based on the goal, the best possible action (based on the knowledge of the world), needs to be selected. Goal-based decision making involves consideration of the future based on the transition model (i.e., “what will happen if I do such-and-such?”) and how it helps to achieve the goal. In reflex agents designs, this information I not explicitly represented, because the built rules map directly from the percepts to actions, without considering/knowing the future state.\nThe main difference between goal-based agents and utility-based agents is that the performance measure is more general. It does not only consider a binary distinction between “goal achieved” and “goal not achieved” but allows comparing different world states according to their relative utility or expected utility, respectively (i.e., how happy the agent is with the resulting state). Utility-based agents can still make rational decisions when there are conflicting goals for which only one can be achieved (here the utility function needs to specify a trade-off) and when there are several goals that the agent can aim for, none of which can be achieved with certainty (here the utility function provides a which in which the likelihood of success can be weighed against the importance of the goals, e.g., speed and energy consumption in routing).\nExample: a goal-based agent for routing just selects actions based on a single, binary goal: reaching the destination; a utility-based agents also considers additional goals like spending as less time as possible on the road, spending as less money as possible, having the best scenery on the trip, etc. and tries to maximize overall utility across these goals. In this example, reaching the destiny is the ultimate goal, without achieving that utility would be zero. However, utility will increase or decrease related to how the actions chosen impact the achievement of the other goals, which importance need to be weighed."

    "text": "Structure\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example: A partial search tree for finding a route from Arad to Bucharest; based on Russel and Norvig (2022)\n\n\n\nFigure 2 visualizes a partial search tree: the first few steps in finding a path from Arad (initial state) to Bucharest (goal).\n\nThe root node of the search tree is the initial state \\(s\\) (Arad)\nThe available actions considerd using \\(ACTIONS(s)\\)\nNew nodes, called child nodes or successor nodes are generated using \\(RESULT(s,a)\\) (i.e., the root node is expanded)\nEach child node has Arad as its parent node\nThe child node to be considered next is selected by the minimum value of some evaluation function \\(f(n)\\) (strategies see below)\n\nIn Figure 2, nodes that have been expanded are white with bold letters; nodes on the frontier that have been generated but not yet expanded are in white and regular letters; the set of states corresponding to these two types of nodes are said to have been reached. Nodes that could be generated next are shown in faint dashed lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of search trees\n\n\n\nA search tree is a “what if” tree of plans and their outcomes.\n\nThe start state is the root node,\nchildren correspond to successors,\nnodes show states, but correspond to PLANS that achieve those states\n\nThere are lots of repeated structure in the search tree. Thus, for most problems, the whole tree can never be actually built. In practice, both state space graphs and search trees are constructed on demand and as little as possible (Russel and Norvig 2022).\n\n\nSearch algorithms require a data structure to keep track of the search tree. A node in the tree is represented by a data structure with four components (Russel and Norvig 2022, 91):\n\n\\(node.STATE\\): the state to which the node corresponds\n\\(node.PARENT\\): the node in the tree that generated this node\n\\(node.ACTION\\): the action that was applied to the parent’s state to generate this node\n\\(node.PATH-COST\\): the total cost of the path from the initial state to generate this node\n\nFollowing the PARENT pointers back from a node allows to revocer the states and actions along the path to that node. Doing this from a goal node generates the solution.\n\nExample data structure in pseudo code:\nvar searchTree = {\n  node.STATE: \"Bucharest\"\n  node.PARENT: {\n    node.STATE: \"Pitesti\"\n    node.PARENT: {\n      node.STATE: \"Rimmicu Vilcea\"\n      node.PARENT: {\n        node.STATE: \"Sibiu\"\n        node.PARENT: {\n          node.STATE: \"Arad\"\n          node.PARENT: NULL\n          node.ACTION: NULL\n          node.PATH-COST: 0\n        }\n        node.ACTION: \"Arad to Sibiu\"\n        node.PATH-COST: 140\n      }\n      node.ACTION: \"Sibiu to Rimmicu Vilcea\"\n      node.PATH-COST: 220\n    }\n    node.ACTION: \"Rimmicu Vilcea to Pitesti\"\n    node.PATH-COST: 317\n  }\n  node.ACTION: \"Pitesti to Bucharest\"\n  node.PATH-COST: 418\n}\n\nIn addition, a data structure to store the fontier is neded. Usually this is realized using a queue with following functions (Russel and Norvig 2022, 91):\n\n\\(IS-EMPTY(frontier)\\): returns true only if there are no nodes in the frontier\n\\(POP(frontier)\\): removes the top node from the frontier and returns it\n\\(TOP(frontier)\\): returns (but does not remove) the top node from the frontier\n\\(ADD(node,frontier)\\): inserts node into its proper place in the queue"

performance of problem-solving algorithms can be evaluated in four ways (Russel and Norvig 2022, 93):\n\nCompleteness: Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one, and to correctly report failure when there is not?\nCost optimality: Does it find a solution with the lowest : cost-path of all solutions?\nTime complexity: How long does it take to find a solution (e.g., measured in seconds or by the number of states and actions considered)?\nSpace complexity: How much memory is needed to perform the search?"

Daten folgen also einer Syntax. Die Ergänzung der Daten um einen Kontext verschafft den Daten Bedeutung. Dadurch entsteht Information. Im Beispiel wird durch Hinzufügen von weiteren Zeichen und Daten (€ = und 1 US $), dass mit 0,87 der Wert des Dollars in Euro gemeint ist.

In diesem Modell werden unter anderem Mindestanforderungen an Datensätze definiert, die von jedem Anwendungssystem implementiert werden müssen (bspw. Struktur der Kundennummer). Diese erleichtern unter anderem den automatischen Abgleich von Daten.\nProzessmodelle und Organigrammen beschreiben die Funktionen und Abläufe eines Unternehmens (Organisationsarchitektur) und welche Informationssysteme für welche Aufgaben eingesetzt werden."

Just think of what we discussed during the last lectures (e.g., “shaping the path”). But ultimately, the way we navigate our inner world, our ability to be healthy with ourselves, with our emotions, to be connected with our values and who we want to be, this has an outsize impact on everything else.\nThis class is about emotional agility, the ability to come to your inner world—your thoughts, emotions, experiences and self-stories—with courage, compassion and curiosity. We try to find answers to the questions why and how we should learn from them, evaluate the situations we face, be clear-sighted about your options and move forward with values and purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis unit is inspired by and based on the books Resilience by Southwick, Charney, and DePierro (2023) and Emotional Agility by S.

Adopting agility in your emotions is more likely to steer you on the right path and allow you to be flexible when you need to be.\nEmotional agility is needed as the world is constantly changing and, thus, always presenting us with new opportunities and situations to which conditions or pre-programmed cognitive and emotional responses are not helpful.

What am I feeling right now? What does this say about my values? An emotionally agile person is able to recognize their feelings with self-compassion and understanding.\nBeing more self-compassionate includes:\n\nletting go of self-criticism and expectations of perfection (within yourself, your work, your life at home);\nrecognizing that comparing yourself with others is, almost always, a losing game;\nunderstanding that self-compassion does not make you weak or lazy. In fact, research shows the opposite - that self-compassion sharpens your edge;\nappreciating that self-compassion is not about lying to yourself. People who are self-compassionate are more likely to face into the truth about themselves and their weaknesses, than those who lack self-compassion.\n\n\n\nStepping out\nStepping out means facing and labeling the problem. You need to take an objective view and assess your emotions. This can help you filter feelings that may not be entirely appropriate and to find ways to deal with what you are feeling.\nWhen you step out objectively, you are in control of your feelings and not the other way around.\nSkills you can cultivate:\n\nThe ability for you, the thinker, rather than the thought to be in charge, and for you, the person, rather than your emotions to be in charge. In other words, developing the skill that allows you to be centered, reflective and intentional in your reactions to events around you.\nDeveloping a ‘meta view’ or the ability to still feel your feelings and think your thoughts but to ‘helicopter’ above these in order to make effective decisions.\nThe ability to recognize when you are holding on to specific positions and ideas in ways that may not serve your life, and to let go of these.\n\n\n\nWalking your why\n‘Walking your why’ means discovering what is important to you and acting accordingly. When you walk your why, you live by your personal values as closely as you possibly can. Living by your values will help to make your life more meaningful and satisfying.\nWhile it is not always possible to work or live the exact life you wish, there is usually a way to make your life or job fit better within your values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome characteristics of values (S. David 2016)\n\n\n\nValues\n\nare freely chosen; have not been imposed on you;\nare not goals; they are ongoing rather than fixed;\nguide you rather then constrain you;\nare active not static;\nallow you to get closer to the way you want to life your life;\nbring you freedom from social comparison;\nfoster self-acceptance, which is crucial for mental health.\n\n\n\nWhen we move towards our values and are able to make choices that align us with who we want to be, that is incredibly empowering, and provides a new found sense of autonomy in difficult situations.\nTo make a difference in this area it may help you to:\n\nWatch the gaps: Simply noticing the gaps between your values and your behaviors in specific domains (at work, home, in your relationships or as they relate to your health and wellbeing) can help you to close them.\nThink first: “is my response in line with my values of Accountability, Straightforwardness and Challenge?”\nRemember that values are not abstract and intangible ideas. Rather they are qualities of action that you can bring to every day choices.\n\n\n\nMove on\nOnce you’ve unpacked what you’re feeling, why you’re feeling that way, and aligned your next steps with who you want to be in the situation, it’s time to move on and take action.\nEmotionally agile individuals handle situations as they come up, feel them fully, make a plan, and don’t delay.\nThis requires some critical areas of focus:\n\nA change mindset: developing the belief that positive change is actually possible. Research shows that subtle differences in our beliefs about change can have a long-term impact across many different areas of our lives.\nEffective motivations: trying to make a change based on a ‘have-to’ motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a sense of obligation to your doctor, spouse, or due to shame) is less likely to be effective than a change based on a ‘want-to’ motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a genuine, internal desire to be healthier.) The type of motivation we have is critically important in determining whether a change will be successful.\nHabit tweaks: understanding how to master the physics of successful habit change.\nMoving to discomfort: making the choice to push oneself towards the edge of one’s comfort zone as one tries to develop skills and cultivate relationships."

That is what we call a research design.\n\n\n\nThe action plan\n\n\nA research design is the blueprint for the collection, measurement, and analysis of data that\n\n\ntypically requires a combination of reasoning skills such as induction, deduction, and abduction;\nand often involves different research strategies such as exploration, rationalization, and validation (Recker 2021)\n\n\n\n\nExploration:\n\nThe systematic discovery of things or phenomena encountered in common experience. Often involves induction.\n\nRationalization\n\nMaking sense of the puzzle or problem that interests us. Often involves abduction.\n\nValidation\n\nSubjecting an emergent or existing theory to rigorous examination and testing. Often involves deduction.\n\n\nDifferent research methods can be used as a tool to support inductive, deductive, or abductive reasoning.\n\n\n\nDeduction\n\n\nDrawing a conclusion from a general premise to a specific instance: from theory to data.\n\n\n\nDeduction is a form of logical reasoning that involves deriving arguments as logical consequences of a set of more general premises (i.e., justification). It involves deducing a conclusion from a general premise (i.e., a known theory) to a specific instance (i.e., an observation) (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Deduction involves starting with general principles, theories, or hypotheses and deriving specific predictions or conclusions from them.\nProcess: Researchers begin with a set of premises or assumptions and use logical reasoning to draw specific implications or hypotheses.\nPurpose: The primary goal of deduction is to test the validity of a general theory or hypothesis by examining its specific implications.\nProblem: If the premise is incorrect, the deduction becomes invalid.\nExample: If all humans are mortal (general premise), and Socrates is a human (specific premise), then it can be deduced that Socrates is mortal.\n\n\n\n\nInduction\n\n\nInferring a general conclusion from a set of specific observations: from data to theory.\n\n\n\nA form of logical reasoning that involves inferring a general conclusion from a set of specific facts or observations (i.e., formal inference). It is used to infer theoretical concepts and patterns from observed data or known facts to generate new knowledge by proceeding from particulars to generals (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Induction involves deriving general principles, theories, or (tentative) conclusions from specific observations or evidence.\nProcess: Researchers gather specific data or evidence and use it to draw broader patterns, generalizations, or theories.\nProblem: Inductive arguments, which can be weak or strong, cannot be justified, only supported or not supported.\nPurpose: Induction aims to develop new theories, patterns, or generalizations based on observed evidence.\nExample: Observing that all observed swans are white (specific observations) leads to the generalization that all swans are white (general principle).\n\n\n\n\nAbduction\n\n\nMaking sense of an observation by drawing inferences about the best possible explanation: educated guessing.\n\n\n\nAbduction is the process of making sense of an observation by drawing inferences about the best possible explanation for an observed consequence after the fact (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Abduction involves creating plausible explanations or hypotheses to explain observed phenomena.\nProcess: Researchers propose potential explanations for observations or patterns, often guided by existing knowledge or theories.\nPurpose: Abduction is used when faced with surprising or unexpected observations that do not fit existing theories, aiming to generate new hypotheses for further investigation. It is geared toward the discovery of entirely new ideas rather then a mode of justification (through deduction) or formal inference (through induction).\nExample: If a crime scene has fingerprints but no eyewitnesses, and it’s known that criminals often leave fingerprints (existing knowledge), then it’s abductive to hypothesize that a criminal was present."

Good research typically moves back and forth among them, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe emphasis of any one study can be on either end (1,2,3) or in combination (e.g., 4). Often, only so-called research programs (combinations of multiple studies) can achieve all (5).\n\nWe may find that explaining a particular behavior requires that we collect additional observations about other behaviours that we did not identify as relevant to our initial exploration. The interplay between rationalization and exploration can also provide a set of initial evidence against which we can test the outcomes of our rationalization process or evaluate a set of tentative propositions between constructs that capture a phenomenon. The rationalization should be valid in light of any observations that we collected. Once a rationalization, in which tentative general propositions are created through inductive reasoning from observations or through abduction, has been made, we can proceed to validation, where we develop testable hypotheses or propositions for a particular context or scenario from our more general theory. These hypotheses can be subjected to further empirical tests using new or existing cases. The results or evidence collected may suggest that we revise our rationalization (moving from validation back to rationalization), which could involve abduction. For example, our validation may find an observable mechanism that speaks against the logic of our propositions, requiring us to make an educated guess about why it happened or how these observations can otherwise be explained.

    "text": "Operationalization\n\n\n\n\nMeasures and measurements based on Burton-Jones and Lee (2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nQuantitative research begins by creating a theory to explain real-world phenomena. The theory is then tested using measures that represent variables, and data is collected from real-world phenomena. Figure 3 points to two main challenges in this process.\n\nShared meaning: If the connection between theoretical concepts and measures is unclear, measuring the constructs accurately becomes difficult. Ensuring accurate measurements minimizes data problems. However, without shared meaning, even accurate measurements won’t reflect the intended constructs. For instance, if you’re studying emotions related to technology and you confuse “compassion” with a similar concept like “empathy,” issues arise.\nAaccuracy of measurement: Researchers need accurate data to draw valid conclusions. No matter the analysis, conclusions are unreliable without data reliability.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Measures and measurements based on Burton-Jones and Lee (2017)\n\n\n\n\nPhases and outcomes\n\n\n\n\nPhases and outcomes of the operationalization process\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConceptualization\nConceptualization refers to the definition of fuzzy and imprecise, vague and ambiguous constructs of social science in concrete and precise terms. It aims at ensuring shared meaning about the constructs at the theoretical level. It often requires to separate related constructs conceptually (i.e., providing clear definitions)\nConstruct conceptualization involves identifying and defining what the construct is intended to represent or capture conceptually, discussing how the construct differs from other related constructs, and defining any dimensions or content domains that are relevant to grasping and defining the conceptual theme of the construct it its entirety. Each construct should have (1) a label, (2) a definition, (3) ideally one or more examples that demonstrate its meaning (as a demonstration of face validity), and (4) a discussion of related constructs in the literature. Papers and theses often use construct definition tables for this purpose, where each of the four points becomes a column and each construct in the study has its own row (Recker 2021, 100).\n\n\nNature of constructs\nConstructs can be unidimensional or multidimensional (Wright et al. 2012).\n\nUnidimensional constructs are expected to have a single underlying dimension. They can be measured using a single measure or test. For instance, a person’s weight and age are simple unidimensional constructs.\nMultidimensional constructs consist of two or more underlying dimensions. Each dimension must be measured separately (either reflective or formative). For instance, a persons’ academic ability can be conceptualized as consisting of two dimensions: mathematical and verbal ability.\n\n\n\nFrom the theoretical to the empirical dimension\nOperationalization refers to the development of indicators or items for measuring theoretically defined constructs at the empirical level. For instance, the unobservable theoretical construct “socioeconomic status” could be defined as the ‘level of family income’ and thus operationalized using an indicator (interchangeably used terms: indicator question, item) that asks respondents for the annual family income\nThe combination of indicators at the empirical level representing a given construct is called a variable. Variables may be independent, dependent, mediating or moderating (i.e., the cause, the outcome, the underlying mechanism or condition)\n\n\nScales\nEach indicator may have several attributes (or levels) and each attribute represent a value (e.g., a gender variable may have two attributes).\nCommon rating scales are\n\nNominal scales for categorial data (e.g., gender)\nLikert-type scales for latent constructs, measuring ordinal data by simply-worded statements to which respondents can indicate their extent of agreement (e.g., using Excel would improve my job performance.)\n\n\n\n\n\nReliability and validity\n\n\n\n\nMeeting requirements for validity and reliability (Recker 2021, 93)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Meeting requirements for validity and reliability (Recker 2021, 93)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidity and reliability in research\n\n\n\nInternal validity (causality) examines whether the observed change in a dependent variable is indeed caused by a corresponding change in independent variable, and not by variables outside the research context. Different research designs vary considerably in their respective level of internal validity (e.g., experiments vs. field surveys).\nExternal validity (generalizability) refers to whether the observed associations can be generalized from the sample to the population, or to other people, organizations, contexts, or time (ecological validity).\nReliability refers to the consistency, stability, and reproducibility of measurement or data collection methods. It reflects the extent to which a measurement or research instrument produces consistent results when applied repeatedly under the same conditions.\n\n\nValidity of measurements represent the essence or content upon which the construct is focused, i.e., valid measurements measure what they intend to measure.\n\nTheoretical assessments assess how well an operationalization fits the conceptual definition of the relevant theoretical construct.\n\nFace validity: The indicator seems to be a reasonable measure of its underlying construct (“on its face”). Example: Is annual salary a good measure of job satisfaction? No.\nContent validity: A set of measurement items matches the content domain of the construct.\n\nEmpirical (statistical) assessments of validity, which assess how well a measurement behaves in correspondence to the theoretical predictions. Tests include convergent validity and discriminant validity; see Straub, Boudreau, and Gefen (2004).\n\nReliability describes the extent to which a variable or set of indicators is consistent in what it is intended to measure. If multiple measurements are taken, the reliable measurements will all be very consistent in their values.\n\nThe operations of a study can be repeated in equal settings with the same results\nReliability tries to decrease dependency on researcher’s subjectivity\nThere is a wide range of statistical reliability tests such as internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and composite reliability; see @Straub, Boudreau, and Gefen (2004)\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nTable 1: Scales from TAM (Venkatesh et al. 2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct\nDefinition\nIndicators\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Intention\nParticipant’s intentions\nto use a particular system\nin the future\n- I intend to use the system in the next  months\n- I predict I would use the system in the next  months\n- I plan to use the system in the next  months\n\n\nAttitude towards Behavior\nAn individual’s positive\nor negative feelings about\nperforming the target behavior.\n- Using the system is a bad/good idea\n- Using the system is a foolish/wise idea\n- I dislike/like the idea of using the system\n- Using the system is unpleasant/ pleasant\n\n\nPerceived Usefulness\nThe degree to which a\nperson believes that using\na particular system would\nenhance his or her job\nperformance.\n- Using the system in my job would enable me to accomplish tasks more quickly\n- Using the system would improve my job performance\n- Using the system in my job would increase my productivity\n- Using the system would enhance my effectiveness on the job\n- Using the system would make it easier to do my job\n- I would find the system useful in my job\n\n\nPerceived Ease of Use\nThe degree to which a person\nbelieves that using a system\nwould be free of effort.\n- Learning to operate the system would be easy for me\n- I would find it easy to get the system to do what I want it to do\n- My interaction with the system would be clear and understandable\n- I would find the system to be flexible to interact with\n- It would be easy for me to become skillful at using the system\n- I would find the system easy to use"

    "text": "Measurement development\nAfter having developed a conceptual definition of the construct, the first step is to identify and to develop potential items for the construct (Recker 2021).\nBecause developing and assessing measures and measurement is time-consuming and challenging, the first rule should always be to identify and re-use (wherepossible) measures and measurements that have already been developed and assessed.\nExisting items—best case, you rely on established measures. Look for measurements reported in papers or use a measurement database such as TheoryOn or the Handbook of Management Scales.\nNew items—follow one of the guidelines published. You might start with Recker (2021)’s procedural model to create new measurement instruments for conceptually defined theory constructs.\n\nIf you need to adapt existing items, you should take multiple steps to evaluate and optimize content validity of the items selected/created:\n\nExpert panel:  people with experience about the domain judge whether items appropriately describe the construct\nCard-sorting: experts are asked to sort/rank the items to the constructs of interest. If items are consistently assigned to the intended construct, then there is confidence for ‘content validity’\nRevision: items that are not consistently assigned to the intended construct, need to be rephrased or eliminated. Re-evaluate the items until sufficient ‘content validity’ is achieved\n\nAfter data collection (or best case a pre-study) you need to validate the instrument by statistically check reliability and validity.\n\nExploratory factor analysis (EFA): a method to uncover the underlying structure (constructs) within variables/items – to ‘explore’ the relationships between items. Usually done with the software ‘SPSS’.\nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA): a method to ‘confirm’ that the items measure the target construct and nothing else. Can be done with software like ‘SmartPLS’."

It’s used to test hypotheses about these relationships.\nSmall sample sizes: PLS-SEM is particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes, as it is more robust to violations of normality and distribution assumptions.\nPrediction-oriented: PLS-SEM can be used for predictive purposes, making it suitable for applications where the primary goal is to predict an outcome or estimate relationships, rather than explain complex underlying processes.\nReflective and formative constructs: PLS-SEM can handle both reflective (indicators represent different facets of the same construct) and formative (indicators collectively define the construct) measurement models.\nNon-normal data: PLS-SEM is less sensitive to assumptions of multivariate normality, making it suitable for data that do not follow a normal distribution."

They propose that moderate social responsibility can positively impact financial performance, but there might be diminishing returns or potential negative effects beyond a certain point of social responsibility.\nThe authors emphasize that while a moderate level of social responsibility can be associated with improved financial performance, pursuing excessive social responsibility might not necessarily lead to better financial results. They suggest that companies need to find an optimal level of social responsibility that aligns with their strategic goals and business context.\nBarnett and Salomon (2012) offer insights into the complex relationship between social and financial performance in organizations, highlighting that while being socially responsible can positively influence financial outcomes to a certain extent, an excessively high level of social responsibility might not always be conducive to improved financial performance. The findings call for a strategic balance in integrating social responsibility into business practices."

    "text": "Four hierarchies\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Four planning hierarchies according to Mintzberg (2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMintzberg (2000) structures traditional planning into two domains—performance control and action planning.\nPerformance control imposes general performance standards (i.e., desired output) over a period of time, with no reference to specific actions and assess whether or not that standard has been achieved. The purpose of performance control is to regulate the overall results of a given unit. Objectives, budgets, operating plans, and various other kinds of generalo standards are established for the unit, and its performance is later measured in terms of these standards and the results fed back up the hierarchy.\nAction planning specifies decision that call for specific actions—to market new products, build new factories, sell old machines. Some of the proposed actions may be taken within single units, but others can cut acrros unit boundaries. By its imposition of specific decisions, action planning turns out to be a less than pure form of standardizing outputs; more exactly, it falls between that and standardizing work processes.\nSo whereas performance control says, “Increase sales by 10 percent this year [in any way you care to]”, action planning says, “Do it by introducing blue widgets”.\nThe diagram in Figure 4 explains how performance control and action planning work. The arrows in the diagram go in both directions, showing that performance control can happen in two ways. The first way is top-down, where objectives set by top management become more detailed as they move down the hierarchy. The second way is bottom-up, where lower-level units set their own performance standards. These standards are then combined as they move up the hierarchy and eventually become overall objectives for the entire organization at the top level.\nIn real-world practice, the performance control system is likely to operate not just as a pure top-down or bottom-up process, but as a combination of both. Some performance standards are detailed by top management and trickle down the hierarchy, while others are proposed by employees and aggregate up. At each level, managers try to set standards for their teams, and employees may suggest less strict ones. Through this negotiation process, a mix of composite and detailed performance standards emerges at all levels of the organization.\nThe action planning system primarily follows a top-down approach. In theory, it starts with strategic planning, where the organization evaluates its strengths and weaknesses based on environmental trends. It then creates a comprehensive set of strategies for the future. These strategies are translated into programs, which involve specific capital projects (e.g., launching a new product line and constructing a new factory) or operating projects (i.e., projects where costs are not capitalized typically evolving around enhancing and streamlining existing operations such as developing a marketing campaign). These programs are further detailed and scheduled, eventually becoming specific operating specifications that prompt direct actions.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Four planning hierarchies according to Mintzberg (2000)"

In a functional structure, employees with similar skills and expertise are organized into functional departments or units, each focused on a specific aspect of the organization’s operations. This structure is common in many types of organizations and is often characterized by clear lines of authority and reporting (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Functional structure based on Dess et al.

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA divisional structure in organizational terms refers to a design that organizes an enterprise into semi-autonomous units or divisions, each responsible for a distinct product, service, or customer group. Each division within the structure operates as a separate business entity with its own functional areas, such as marketing, finance, and operations, though some functional are performed in each separate division and centrally (e.g., finance). The divisions are organized by product or service, customer-types, or process (i.e., strategic business units). This structure is often adopted by large organizations with diverse product lines or those operating in multiple markets (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Divisional structure based on Dess et al.

They have their own leadership, decision-making processes, and strategic initiatives.\nProduct, market, or geographic focus: This allows for specialization and focused attention on the unique needs of each market or product line.\nFunctional independence: Each division has its own set of functional areas (e.g., marketing, finance, operations) to support its specific activities. This enables divisions to adapt and respond more efficiently to the requirements of their particular markets.\nProfit and loss accountability: Divisions are often held accountable for their own financial performance. This accountability is reflected in their profit and loss statements, making divisions responsible for their own costs, revenues, and profitability.\nCoordination at the corporate level: While divisions operate independently, there is usually coordination at the corporate level. Corporate headquarters may provide support functions that serve all divisions, such as human resources, legal, and overall strategic planning.\nStrategic flexibility: The divisional structure offers strategic flexibility, allowing each division to tailor its strategies to the specific demands of its market or product category. This adaptability can enhance responsiveness to changes in the business environment.\nClear accountability: The structure provides clear lines of accountability, making it easier to assess the performance of each division individually. This clarity helps in making informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic adjustments.\n\nThe divisional structure is particularly suitable for large and complex organizations with diverse business interests. It allows for specialization and focused management attention in each division, fostering agility and responsiveness to market variations. However, it also requires effective coordination and communication between the corporate center and the individual divisions to ensure alignment with overall organizational objectives."

In a matrix structure, employees have dual reporting relationships - they report both to a functional manager and to a product, project, or geographic manager. This structure is particularly useful for organizations dealing with complex projects, multiple products, or a combination of functional and divisional demands (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Matrix structure based on Dess et al.

This allows for flexibility in addressing both functional and divisional needs.\nEnhanced communication and coordination: Facilitates improved communication and coordination between different parts of the organization, as individuals from various functional areas collaborate on specific projects or products.\nProject-based teams: Often involves the creation of project-based or cross-functional teams where individuals from different functional areas work together on specific tasks or projects.\nFlexibility and responsiveness: Offers greater flexibility and responsiveness to changes in the external environment, as the organization can quickly adapt to new projects, market demands, or technological advancements.\nResource efficiency: Allows for efficient use of resources, as individuals with specific expertise can be allocated to projects or products as needed without being limited by the boundaries of a traditional functional structure.\nComplex decision-making: Involves more complex decision-making processes, as employees may need to navigate and balance the expectations and priorities of both their functional and divisional managers.\n\nWhile the matrix structure offers advantages in terms of flexibility and responsiveness, it can also pose challenges related to potential conflicts, power struggles, and the complexity of reporting relationships. Effective communication, collaboration, and a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities are crucial for the success of a matrix structure. The matrix structure is often adopted in industries such as information technology, aerospace, or complex project-based organizations where interdisciplinary collaboration is essential."

Peter Drucker, Management consultant, educator and author\n\n\n\n\nThe most brilliant strategies can fail if they are not congruent with the prevailing culture within an organization. Successful organizations, thus, integrate culture and strategy.\n\n\nThe phrase conveys the idea that a company’s culture, which includes its shared values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors, can have a more substantial influence on the organization’s outcomes than its strategic plans or strategies. In other words, a well-crafted strategy may look excellent on paper, but if it doesn’t align with or is undermined by the prevailing organizational culture, it is less likely to succeed (Drucker et al. 1988).\n\nAn organization’s culture influences how employees behave, make decisions, and interact with one another. If a strategic plan contradicts cultural norms or values, employees are likely to prioritize cultural consistency over strategic alignment.\nCulture can either enable or constrain the execution of strategic initiatives. A supportive culture aligns with the strategy, fosters commitment, and drives performance. Conversely, a culture that resists change or lacks alignment can hinder even the most well-conceived strategy.\nLeaders play a crucial role in shaping and aligning culture with strategy. Effective leaders understand the culture’s impact and work to foster a culture that supports the strategic vision.\nSuccessful organizations integrate culture and strategy. They develop strategies that not only consider external market dynamics but also respect and leverage the existing culture. Additionally, they may seek to evolve the culture to better support strategic goals.\n\nImplications (David and David 2016):\n\nStrategies that require fewer cultural changes may be more attractive because extensive changes can take considerable time and effort\nPolitical maneuvering consumes valuable time, subverts organizational objectives, diverts human energy, and results in the loss of some valuable employees\nPolitical biases and personal preferences get unduly embedded in strategy choice decisions"

This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.\nSeizing: Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nReconfiguring: In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology.

Competition is caused not only by other players, but also by the broader environment (e.g., the underlying economics/structure of the industry) (Mintzberg 2014). The external strategic management audit1 focuses on identifying and evaluating environmental trends and events beyond the control of a single firm (David and David 2016).1 The external strategic management audit is sometimes also called environmental scanning or industry analysis.\nThe purpose of an external audit is to develop a finite list of opportunities that could benefit a firm as well as threats that should be avoided. As the term finite suggests, the external audit is not aimed at developing an exhaustive list of every possible factor that could influence the business; rather, it is aimed at identifying key variables that offer actionable responses.\nIdentifying and evaluating external opportunities and threats enables organizations to develop a clear mission, to design strategies to achieve long-term objectives, and to develop policies to achieve annual objectives. Firms should be able to respond either offensively or defensively to the factors by formulating strategies that take advantage of external opportunities or that minimize the impact of potential threats."

They represent enduring shifts in societal, economic, and technological dynamics.\nGlobal impact: Megatrends transcend geographical boundaries and affect countries, regions, and industries worldwide. They have a broad and pervasive reach.\nTransformational effects: Megatrends bring about fundamental changes and transformations in various domains, including demographics, technology, environment, politics, and culture. They reshape the way people live, work, and interact.\nCross-industry relevance: Megatrends impact multiple industries and sectors, often requiring organizations to adapt, innovate, and adjust their strategies to remain competitive and relevant.\nStrategic implications: Organizations must consider megatrends in their strategic planning processes.

    "section": "5 Ps for Strategy",
    "text": "5 Ps for Strategy\n\n\nStrategy as plan, ploy, pattern, position, and perspective.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as plan\nStrategy’ sometimes refers to a plan – some sort of consciously intended course of action, or a set of guidelines to deal with a situation. By this definition, strategies have two essential characteristics:\n\nThey are made in advance of intended actions.\nThey are developed consciously and purposefully before taking action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAn automobile manufacturer develops a detailed 5-year strategic plan outlining product launches, market expansion, and cost reduction targets. This plan serves as a roadmap for the company’s future actions and resource allocation.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as ploy\nA ploy refers to a specific maneuver or tactic employed to outwit competitors or achieve a particular objective. Ploys can be thought of as strategic tricks or moves, often aimed at exploiting competitors’ weaknesses or changing the competitive landscape.\n\nStrategy as ploy is a specific ‘manoeuvre’ intended to outwit an opponent or competitor.\nStrategy as ploy takes advantage of the opponent or competitor vulnerability.\nStrategy as ploy may involve diversion or deception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA beverage company lowers the prices of its products temporarily to gain a competitive advantage during a specific promotion or to respond to a competitor’s move. This pricing ploy is a tactical strategy aimed at achieving short-term objectives.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as a pattern\nPatterns in strategy refer to the consistency and regularity of actions and decisions over time (i.e., a pattern in a stream of actions). These patterns emerge from the cumulative effect of an organization’s actions and reveal its strategy in practice, regardless of whether it aligns with the formal plan.\n\nStrategy is consistency in behavior, whether or not intended.\nWhile plans refer to the intended strategy, patterns refer to the realized strategy.\nPlans and patterns can be quite independent of each other: plans may go unrealized, while patterns may appear without preconception.\n\nThus deliberate strategies–where intentions that existed previously are realized–can be distinguished from emergent strategies–where patterns developed in the absence of/despite intentions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA fast-food chain consistently focuses on introducing new menu items and promotions every season. Over time, customers come to expect and anticipate these recurring patterns of innovation, which become a distinctive part of the company’s strategy. Strategy as Position:\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as position\nPositioning in strategy involves finding a distinctive and favorable place in the market or industry. It focuses on creating a competitive advantage by being unique in some way, whether through pricing, product features, or other factors.\n\nStrategy seeks a match between the internal and the external context. Thus, strategy could be a niche, a unique place that generates rent, or a product-market domain.\nA position can be targeted/aspired to through a plan, or it may be found through a pattern of behavior.\n\nPosition may be defined with respect to a single competitor, multiple competitors or the market at large, strategies to avoid competition and even strategies to subvert the forces of competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA luxury fashion brand positions itself as a high-end, exclusive label with a limited distribution network and premium pricing. This strategic position aims to appeal to a niche market of affluent customers seeking luxury and prestige.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as perspective\nStrategy is a perspective – an ingrained way of perceiving the world, a collective intuition about how the world works. It can also be referred to as culture, or ideology.\nThis definition takes a very broad view of strategy. It highlights two key points:\n\nPerspective in this context is collective—it is shared by members of the organisation.\nStrategy is a concept—it is an abstraction that exists only in the minds of the interested parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAn environmentally conscious company adopts a perspective of sustainability and eco-friendliness in all its business operations. This perspective informs product development, sourcing of materials, and marketing, aligning the organization’s strategy with its commitment to environmental responsibility."

Together, they can enhance our ability to understand/manage the processes by which strategies form."

    "text": "Overview\n\n\nDesign, positioning, planning, entrepreneurial, cognitive, learning, power, cultural, environmental & configurational\n\n\n\nStrategy literature has been characterized by ten major schools since its inception in the 1960s – three prescriptive and seven descriptive (Mintzberg 2014).\nThese perspectives are both, fundamentally different processes of strategy development and implementation, reflecting the complexity and diversity of the field of strategic management, as well as different parts of the same process.\n\nDesign and planning schools: a process of conception\nThe schools view strategy as a formal, deliberate process where top management sets clear objectives and plans to achieve them. They emphasize careful analysis and structured planning, where senior management formulates clear, simple and unique strategies in a deliberate process of conscious thought, which are then implemented by others.\nThe key idea of the planning schoool is that the strategy making process is not just cerebral, but formal – decomposable into distinct step, delineated by checklists and supported by techniques (with regard to objectives, budgets, programmes and operating plans). Staff planners replace senior managers as the key players in the process.\nThe design and planning schools primarily focus on the formulation stage of strategic management.

It emphasizes the need to monitor and adapt to changes in the external environment.\n\n\nConfiguration school: a process of transformation\nArgues that competitive advantage comes from a firm’s unique resources and capabilities. Strategy is about leveraging these strengths.\nOne aspect of this school views organisations as configurations of resources — coherent clusters of characteristics and behaviours – and integrates the views of the other schools, i.e. each school of thought has its own place in particular organisational types/configurations.\nChange is, therefore, a process of dramatic transformation – a leap from one configuration to another. This forms the second aspect of the configuration school."

It helps organizations determine whether their strategies are on track and whether adjustments are needed.\nEvaluation involves various levels of management, from top leadership to middle and lower-level managers responsible for specific aspects of the strategy. It is a collaborative effort to ensure that the strategy remains relevant and effective.\nEvaluating strategy can be challenging due to the need for accurate data and the complexities of measuring the impact of strategic decisions.

    "text": "5 Ps for Strategy\n\n\nStrategy as plan, ploy, pattern, position, and perspective.\n\n\n\nStrategy as plan\nStrategy’ sometimes refers to a plan – some sort of consciously intended course of action, or a set of guidelines to deal with a situation. By this definition, strategies have two essential characteristics:\n\nThey are made in advance of intended actions.\nThey are developed consciously and purposefully before taking action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAn automobile manufacturer develops a detailed 5-year strategic plan outlining product launches, market expansion, and cost reduction targets. This plan serves as a roadmap for the company’s future actions and resource allocation.\n\n\n\nStrategy as ploy\nA ploy refers to a specific maneuver or tactic employed to outwit competitors or achieve a particular objective. Ploys can be thought of as strategic tricks or moves, often aimed at exploiting competitors’ weaknesses or changing the competitive landscape.\n\nStrategy as ploy is a specific ‘manoeuvre’ intended to outwit an opponent or competitor.\nStrategy as ploy takes advantage of the opponent or competitor vulnerability.\nStrategy as ploy may involve diversion or deception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nA beverage company lowers the prices of its products temporarily to gain a competitive advantage during a specific promotion or to respond to a competitor’s move. This pricing ploy is a tactical strategy aimed at achieving short-term objectives.\n\n\n\nStrategy as a pattern\nPatterns in strategy refer to the consistency and regularity of actions and decisions over time (i.e., a pattern in a stream of actions). These patterns emerge from the cumulative effect of an organization’s actions and reveal its strategy in practice, regardless of whether it aligns with the formal plan.\n\nStrategy is consistency in behavior, whether or not intended.\nWhile plans refer to the intended strategy, patterns refer to the realized strategy.\nPlans and patterns can be quite independent of each other: plans may go unrealized, while patterns may appear without preconception.\n\nThus deliberate strategies–where intentions that existed previously are realized–can be distinguished from emergent strategies–where patterns developed in the absence of/despite intentions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nA fast-food chain consistently focuses on introducing new menu items and promotions every season. Over time, customers come to expect and anticipate these recurring patterns of innovation, which become a distinctive part of the company’s strategy. Strategy as Position:\n\n\n\nStrategy as position\nPositioning in strategy involves finding a distinctive and favorable place in the market or industry. It focuses on creating a competitive advantage by being unique in some way, whether through pricing, product features, or other factors.\n\nStrategy seeks a match between the internal and the external context. Thus, strategy could be a niche, a unique place that generates rent, or a product-market domain.\nA position can be targeted/aspired to through a plan, or it may be found through a pattern of behavior.\n\nPosition may be defined with respect to a single competitor, multiple competitors or the market at large, strategies to avoid competition and even strategies to subvert the forces of competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nA luxury fashion brand positions itself as a high-end, exclusive label with a limited distribution network and premium pricing. This strategic position aims to appeal to a niche market of affluent customers seeking luxury and prestige.\n\n\n\nStrategy as perspective\nStrategy is a perspective – an ingrained way of perceiving the world, a collective intuition about how the world works. It can also be referred to as culture, or ideology.\nThis definition takes a very broad view of strategy. It highlights two key points:\n\nPerspective in this context is collective—it is shared by members of the organisation.\nStrategy is a concept—it is an abstraction that exists only in the minds of the interested parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAn environmentally conscious company adopts a perspective of sustainability and eco-friendliness in all its business operations. This perspective informs product development, sourcing of materials, and marketing, aligning the organization’s strategy with its commitment to environmental responsibility."

They emphasize careful analysis and structured planning, where senior management formulates clear, simple and unique strategies in a deliberate process of conscious thought, which are then implemented by others.\nThe key idea of the planning schoool is that the strategy making process is not just cerebral, but formal – decomposable into distinct step, delineated by checklists and supported by techniques (with regard to objectives, budgets, programmes and operating plans). Staff planners replace senior managers as the key players in the process.\nThe design and planning schools primarily focus on the formulation stage of strategic management.

However, while OE can support/be part of a strategy, it cannot replace strategy.\nCompetitors can often replicate and imitate operational improvements relatively quickly. Thus, when OE is the basis of competition, it results in absolute improvements for all players, but relative advantage for no one. Further, unless competitors collude to avoid cutthroat competition it leads to competitive/strategic convergence that can be destructive for the industry."

These strategies are based on the scope of the target market and the competitive advantage sought.\n\nStrategies\n\nCost leadership strategy\n\nThe cost leadership strategy centers on achieving the lowest production and delivery costs in an industry, enabling a company to offer products or services at competitive prices while maintaining profitability. Key elements include economies of scale, rigorous cost control, and pricing at or below industry averages. This strategy targets a broad market scope but comes with risks such as intense price competition and the potential need to sacrifice quality or innovation.\n\nDifferentiation strategy\n\nThe differentiation strategy focuses on creating unique and distinctive products or services that customers perceive as valuable and distinct from competitors. This uniqueness allows a company to command premium prices and build customer loyalty. It involves product innovation, effective branding and marketing, and a customer-centric approach. The target market is often broad, appealing to customers willing to pay more for differentiated offerings. However, sustaining differentiation requires ongoing investment and innovation.\n\nFocus strategy\n\nThe focus strategy involves concentrating efforts on serving a specific market segment, niche, or customer group exceptionally well. By tailoring products, services, or solutions to meet the distinct needs of this chosen market, a company can excel within a narrow scope. Key aspects include market segmentation, specialization, and relationship building within the targeted segment. While the focus strategy minimizes exposure to broader market risks, it also makes the company vulnerable to changes in the chosen market and potential competition from larger players.\n\n\n\n\nStuck in the middle\nBeing stuck in the middle refers to a situation where a company attempts to pursue multiple generic strategies simultaneously without excelling in any one of them. This term is often used to describe a lack of clear strategic focus or a failure to achieve a competitive advantage through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus.\nEffective strategic management often involves making deliberate choices about which generic strategy to pursue and aligning the organization’s resources and activities accordingly. When a company tries to pursue multiple strategies without excelling in any of them, it may struggle to compete effectively in its industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade-offs\n\n\n\nTrade-offs are necessary in order to secure a strategic position against activities that are incompatible. The essence of strategy is as much about choosing what not to do as choosing what to do (Mintzberg 2014).\nTrade-offs arise for three reasons: 1. To avoid inconsistencies in image or reputation. 2. Different positions require different product configurations, equipment, skills, management systems, etc. 3. Due to limits on internal coordination and control.\nPositioning trade-offs are essential to strategy – they create the need for choice, and purposefully limit what a company offers. They deter ‘straddling’ and ‘repositioning’ by competitors.\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines (David and David 2016)\n\nMPMDPDD\n\n\nMarket penetration:\n\nWhen current markets are not saturated with a particular product or service\nWhen the usage rate of present customers could be increased significantly\nWhen the market shares of major competitors have been declining while total industry sales have been increasing\nWhen the correlation between dollar sales and dollar marketing expenditures historically has been high\nWhen increased economies of scale provide major competitive advantages\n\n\n\nMarket development:\n\nWhen new channels of distribution are available that are reliable, inexpensive, and of good quality\nWhen an organization is very successful at what it does\nWhen new untapped or unsaturated markets exist\nWhen an organization has the needed capital and human resources to manage expanded operations\nWhen an organization has excess production capacity\nWhen an organization’s basic industry is rapidly becoming global in scope\n\n\n\nProduct development:\n\nWhen an organization has successful products that are in the maturity stage of the product life cycle\nWhen an organization competes in an industry characterized by rapid technological developments\nWhen major competitors offer better-quality products at comparable prices\nWhen an organization competes in a high-growth industry\nWhen an organization has strong research and development capabilities\n\n\n\nRelated diversification:\n\nWhen an organization competes in a no-growth or a slow-growth industry\nWhen adding new, but related, products would significantly enhance the sales of current products\nWhen new, but related, products could be offered at highly competitive prices\nWhen new, but related, products have seasonal sales levels that counterbalance an organization’s existing peaks and valleys\nWhen an organization’s products are currently in the declining stage of the product’s life cycle\nWhen an organization has a strong management team\n\nUnrelated diversification:\n\nWhen revenues derived from an organization’s current products would increase significantly by adding the new, unrelated products\nWhen an organization competes in a highly competitive or a no-growth industry, as indicated by low industry profit margins and returns\nWhen an organization’s present channels of distribution can be used to market the new products to current customers\nWhen the new products have countercyclical sales patterns compared to present products\nWhen an organization’s basic industry is experiencing declining annual sales and profits\nWhen an organization has the capital and managerial talent needed to compete successfully in a new industry\nWhen an organization has the opportunity to purchase an unrelated business that is an attractive investment opportunity\nWhen there exists financial synergy\nWhen existing markets for an organization’s present products are saturated\nWhen antitrust action could be charged against an organization that historically has concentrated on a single industry"

    "text": "Strategies\n\nLocating the core business:\n\nFocuses on identifying and concentrating on the core activities that define the organization’s essential business. This strategy involves a clear understanding of the core competencies and core products or services that the organization excels in. Resources are directed toward strengthening and emphasizing these core areas while potentially divesting from non-core activities.\n\nDistinguishing the core business\n\nFocuses on highlighting and differentiating the core business from competitors. Organizations pursuing this strategy work on creating unique selling propositions (USPs) for their core products or services. They aim to stand out in the market by emphasizing what makes their core offerings distinct and valuable to customers.\n\nElaborating the core business\n\nFocuses on expanding and deepening the core business to explore related opportunities. This strategy involves seeking growth and diversification within the boundaries of the core business. Organizations may introduce new products or services that are closely aligned with their existing core competencies and customer base.\n\nExtending the core business:\n\nFocuses on broadening the core business by exploring new markets or customer segments. Organizations using this strategy look for opportunities to leverage their existing core capabilities and enter new markets or customer groups. It may involve geographical expansion or targeting different demographics.\n\nReconceiving the core business\n\nFocuses on rethinking and transforming the core business to adapt to changing conditions. This strategy is about radical change and innovation. Organizations reassess their core business in response to significant shifts in the industry, technology, or market demands. It may involve redefining the core competencies and adopting a more disruptive approach.\n\n\n\nLocating the core business\nA business can be thought to exist at a junction in a network of industries (Mintzberg 1988).\n\nUpstream business strategy: the flow of the product seems to be divergent, from a basic material to a variety of uses for it. Upstream business tends to be technology and capital-intensive rather than people-intensive, and more inclined to search for advantage through low-cost than through high margins to favor sales push over market pull (e.g., Wieland producing copper semi-finished products).\nMidstream business strategy: here the organization sits at the neck of an hour glass, drawing a variety of inputs into a single production process out of which flows the prpduct to a variety of users (e.g., Apple producing iPhones).\nDownstream business strategy: here a wide variety of inputs converge into a narrow funnel (e.g., Mediamarkt selling many electronic products).\n\nMintzberg (1988) provides a way to analyze and prioritize the essential elements of an organization’s operations. This framework can help companies better understand where they should focus their efforts and resources to strengthen their core business and achieve competitive advantage.\n\n\nDistinguishing the core business\nThe concept of “distinguishing the core business” refers to a strategic approach where an organization emphasizes and differentiates its central or core activities from other non-core or peripheral aspects of its operations. It involves\n\nIdentifying core activities: Before a company can distinguish its core business, it must first identify what its core activities or competencies are. These are the fundamental processes, products, or services that define the essence of the organization and contribute significantly to its success.\nFocusing resources: Once the core activities are identified, the organization allocates a significant portion of its resources, such as talent, capital, and time, to support and strengthen these core elements. This focus ensures that the company excels in the areas that truly set it apart from competitors.\nEmphasizing differentiation: Distinguishing the core business involves creating a clear distinction between what the organization does exceptionally well (its core) and what may be less critical or peripheral to its overall mission. This differentiation often involves developing unique capabilities, expertise, or product/service features that are valued by customers.\nStrategic positioning: By emphasizing and differentiating the core business, the organization strategically positions itself as a leader or specialist in those core activities. This can help it compete more effectively, command premium prices, and build a strong brand reputation.\nResource allocation: The organization may channel a significant portion of its investments, both in terms of financial resources and talent, toward continuous improvement and innovation within the core business. This ongoing investment ensures that the core remains a source of competitive advantage.\n\nPorter’s framework of generic strategies constitute strategies to distinguish the core business. Cost leadership and differentiation align with the idea of distinguishing the core business by focusing on specific strengths, whether in cost efficiency or unique features. Focus strategy aligns with both concepts as it involves concentrating resources and efforts on a specific market segment or niche, which essentially becomes the organization’s core customer base.\n\n\nElaborating the core business\nAn organization can elaborate a business in a number of ways. It can develop its product offerings within that business, it can develop its market via new segments, new channels or new geographic areas, or it can simply push the same products more vigorously through the same markets. This relates well to the strategy types proposed by Ansoff (1965):\n\nPenetration strategies\nMarket development strategies (e.g., geographic extension)\nProduct development strategies\nDiversification strategies\n\n\n\nExtending the core business\nOrganizations might chose to extend their operating chains vertically or horizontally.\n\nVertical integration means backward or forward integration in the operating chain (downstream or upstream; i.e., chain integration strategies)\n\nForward integration: gaining ownership or increased control over distributors or retailers\nBackward integration: seeking ownership or increased control of a firm’s suppliers\n\nHorizontal integration means seeking ownership or increased control over competitors in the saim value chain\n\nThe business can be extended either by internal development or acquisition.\n\n\nReconceiving the core business\nBusiness redefinition represents a complete reimagining of the core business. Mintzberg (1988) identifies three basic reconception strategies:\n\nBusiness redefinition strategy involves fundamentally redefining the organization’s purpose, identity, and core activities in response to changing market conditions or disruptive forces.\nBusiness recombination strategy involves reconfiguring existing resources, capabilities, or business units in new and innovative ways to create value.\nCore relocation strategy refers to shifting the primary focus and resources of the organization from one area or aspect of the business to another."

The purpose of performance control is to regulate the overall results of a given unit. Objectives, budgets, operating plans, and various other kinds of generalo standards are established for the unit, and its performance is later measured in terms of these standards and the results fed back up the hierarchy.\nAction planning specifies decision that call for specific actions—to market new products, build new factories, sell old machines. Some of the proposed actions may be taken within single units, but others can cut acrros unit boundaries. By its imposition of specific decisions, action planning turns out to be a less than pure form of standardizing outputs; more exactly, it falls between that and standardizing work processes.\nSo whereas performance control says, “Increase sales by 10 percent this year [in any way you care to]”, action planning says, “Do it by introducing blue widgets”.\nThe diagram in Figure 4 explains how performance control and action planning work. The arrows in the diagram go in both directions, showing that performance control can happen in two ways. The first way is top-down, where objectives set by top management become more detailed as they move down the hierarchy. The second way is bottom-up, where lower-level units set their own performance standards. These standards are then combined as they move up the hierarchy and eventually become overall objectives for the entire organization at the top level.\nIn real-world practice, the performance control system is likely to operate not just as a pure top-down or bottom-up process, but as a combination of both. Some performance standards are detailed by top management and trickle down the hierarchy, while others are proposed by employees and aggregate up. At each level, managers try to set standards for their teams, and employees may suggest less strict ones. Through this negotiation process, a mix of composite and detailed performance standards emerges at all levels of the organization.\nThe action planning system primarily follows a top-down approach. In theory, it starts with strategic planning, where the organization evaluates its strengths and weaknesses based on environmental trends. It then creates a comprehensive set of strategies for the future. These strategies are translated into programs, which involve specific capital projects (e.g., launching a new product line and constructing a new factory) or operating projects (i.e., projects where costs are not capitalized typically evolving around enhancing and streamlining existing operations such as developing a marketing campaign). These programs are further detailed and scheduled, eventually becoming specific operating specifications that prompt direct actions.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Four planning hierarchies according to Mintzberg (2000)"

It examines profitability through the relationships between net income, sales, and asset turnover. The framework is useful for understanding the drivers of financial performance.\nA Tableau du Bord (a French term for “dashboard”) provides a comprehensive approach to performance measurement. It encompasses both financial and non-financial metrics, presenting a holistic view of organizational performance. This framework is particularly useful for monitoring and managing various aspects of performance in a visually intuitive manner.\nThe Balanced Scorecard is a strategic performance measurement framework that takes a balanced approach by considering multiple perspectives. It includes financial metrics along with customer satisfaction, internal processes, and learning and growth. This framework is valuable for aligning organizational activities with the overall strategy and ensuring a balanced assessment of performance.\nThe Performance Pyramid offers a hierarchical representation of performance metrics, starting from financial indicators at the top and extending to operational metrics at the base. This framework organizes metrics into different levels based on their strategic relevance and impact. It provides a structured approach to performance measurement with a clear linkage to strategic goals.\nThe Performance Prism is a holistic framework that goes beyond traditional measures by considering stakeholders and their interests. It incorporates key elements such as stakeholders, strategies, processes, capabilities, and stakeholder satisfaction. This framework is valuable for providing a broader perspective on performance and assessing the impact on various stakeholders.\n\nEach framework offers a unique perspective on performance measurement. A combination of these frameworks may provide a more comprehensive understanding of performance."

This may include how well planning processes, such as budgeting and forecasting, align with the organization’s size.\nLocus of control refers to an individual’s belief regarding the degree to which they can control events affecting them.

These actions allow a firm to improve its competitive positioning. Purpose of the business and the way the organization seeks to enhance its competitive advantage.\nStructure: Structure allow the firm to focus on areas that are deemed important for its evolution. This includes division of activities; integration and coordination mechanisms.\nSystems: These include formal and informal procedures for measurement, reward and resource allocation.\nShared values: These values define the firm’s key beliefs and aspirations that form the core of its corporate culture.\nSkills: The organization’s core competencies and distinctive capabilities. It is argued that old skills can often act as hindrance in developing new skills.\nStaff: Staff considers people as a pool of resources, which need to be nurtured, developed, guarded, and allocated. It includes organization’s human resources, demographic, educational and attitudinal characteristics.\nStyle: Typical behavior patterns of key groups, such as CEOs, managers, and other professionals."

Leaders can directly supervise and interact with employees, fostering close relationships.\nLow specialization: Job roles and tasks are not highly specialized. Employees often wear multiple hats and perform a variety of functions.\nQuick response to changes: The simplicity of the structure allows for quick adaptation to changes in the environment or market conditions.\n\nWhile a simple structure has its advantages, such as flexibility and quick decision-making, it may face challenges as the organization grows. As the organization expands, there is often a need for more formalization, departmentalization, and delegation of authority. This evolution may lead to the adoption of more complex organizational structures, such as functional structures or divisional structures, to accommodate the increased size and complexity of the organization."

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn a functional structure is an organizational design that groups employees based on their specialized functions or roles within the organization. In a functional structure, employees with similar skills and expertise are organized into functional departments or units, each focused on a specific aspect of the organization’s operations. This structure is common in many types of organizations and is often characterized by clear lines of authority and reporting (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Functional structure based on Dess et al. (2014)\n\n\nKey features of a functional structure include:\n\nClear hierarchy: The structure typically follows a clear hierarchical framework with a top-down chain of command. Each functional department is headed by a manager or director reporting to top leadership.\nSpecialization and expertise: Allows for a high level of specialization and expertise within each functional area. Employees focus on tasks related to their specific functions, leading to efficiency and depth of knowledge.\nCentralized decision-making: Decision-making authority is often centralized at the top of the hierarchy, with top-level executives making key strategic decisions that affect the entire organization.\nEfficient use of resources: Resources, such as personnel and equipment, are efficiently allocated within each functional department. This specialization can lead to economies of scale and resource optimization.\nClarity of roles: Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined within each functional department, contributing to role clarity and well-defined job descriptions.\nCommunication within functions: Communication predominantly occurs vertically within each functional department. Employees within the same function share a common language and understanding of their specific area of expertise.\n\nFunctional structures are well-suited for organizations with a relatively simple product or service line, where efficiency, expertise, and clear specialization are essential. However, they may face challenges when it comes to interdepartmental coordination and communication, especially in dynamic environments where cross-functional collaboration is crucial. Organizations may also adopt additional structures, such as matrix structures or divisional structures, to address the limitations of a purely functional approach in more complex or diversified settings."

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA divisional structure in organizational terms refers to a design that organizes an enterprise into semi-autonomous units or divisions, each responsible for a distinct product, service, or customer group. Each division within the structure operates as a separate business entity with its own functional areas, such as marketing, finance, and operations, though some functional are performed in each separate division and centrally (e.g., finance). The divisions are organized by product or service, customer-types, or process (i.e., strategic business units). This structure is often adopted by large organizations with diverse product lines or those operating in multiple markets (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Divisional structure based on Dess et al. (2014)\n\n\nKey features of a divisional structure include:\n\nDivisional autonomy: Divisions operate with a significant degree of autonomy. They have their own leadership, decision-making processes, and strategic initiatives.\nProduct, market, or geographic focus: This allows for specialization and focused attention on the unique needs of each market or product line.\nFunctional independence: Each division has its own set of functional areas (e.g., marketing, finance, operations) to support its specific activities. This enables divisions to adapt and respond more efficiently to the requirements of their particular markets.\nProfit and loss accountability: Divisions are often held accountable for their own financial performance. This accountability is reflected in their profit and loss statements, making divisions responsible for their own costs, revenues, and profitability.\nCoordination at the corporate level: While divisions operate independently, there is usually coordination at the corporate level. Corporate headquarters may provide support functions that serve all divisions, such as human resources, legal, and overall strategic planning.\nStrategic flexibility: The divisional structure offers strategic flexibility, allowing each division to tailor its strategies to the specific demands of its market or product category. This adaptability can enhance responsiveness to changes in the business environment.\nClear accountability: The structure provides clear lines of accountability, making it easier to assess the performance of each division individually. This clarity helps in making informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic adjustments.\n\nThe divisional structure is particularly suitable for large and complex organizations with diverse business interests. It allows for specialization and focused management attention in each division, fostering agility and responsiveness to market variations. However, it also requires effective coordination and communication between the corporate center and the individual divisions to ensure alignment with overall organizational objectives."

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA matrix structure in organizational terms is a hybrid organizational design that combines elements of both functional and divisional structures. In a matrix structure, employees have dual reporting relationships - they report both to a functional manager and to a product, project, or geographic manager. This structure is particularly useful for organizations dealing with complex projects, multiple products, or a combination of functional and divisional demands (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Matrix structure based on Dess et al. (2014)\n\n\nKey features of a matrix structure include:\n\nDual reporting relationships: Employees report to both a functional manager (based on their area of expertise, such as marketing or finance) and a project or divisional manager (based on the specific project, product, or geographic area they are working on). Functional and Divisional Dimensions:\nCombines the functional dimension (grouping by skills or expertise) with the divisional dimension (grouping by product, project, or geographic area). This allows for flexibility in addressing both functional and divisional needs.\nEnhanced communication and coordination: Facilitates improved communication and coordination between different parts of the organization, as individuals from various functional areas collaborate on specific projects or products.\nProject-based teams: Often involves the creation of project-based or cross-functional teams where individuals from different functional areas work together on specific tasks or projects.\nFlexibility and responsiveness: Offers greater flexibility and responsiveness to changes in the external environment, as the organization can quickly adapt to new projects, market demands, or technological advancements.\nResource efficiency: Allows for efficient use of resources, as individuals with specific expertise can be allocated to projects or products as needed without being limited by the boundaries of a traditional functional structure.\nComplex decision-making: Involves more complex decision-making processes, as employees may need to navigate and balance the expectations and priorities of both their functional and divisional managers.\n\nWhile the matrix structure offers advantages in terms of flexibility and responsiveness, it can also pose challenges related to potential conflicts, power struggles, and the complexity of reporting relationships. Effective communication, collaboration, and a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities are crucial for the success of a matrix structure. The matrix structure is often adopted in industries such as information technology, aerospace, or complex project-based organizations where interdisciplinary collaboration is essential."

Therefore, one cannot identify and reject a poor strategy, or improve a good one.\nFailure to identify and analyse the obstacles leads merely to stretch goals/budgets/wish lists.\n\nMistaking goals for strategy:\n\nIt is important to see the distinction between the goals, and the strategy used to achieve those goals.\nThe job of a leader – the strategist – is to have a strategy that focuses effort on achieving the goal.\n\nBad strategic objectives:\n\nAnother sign of poor strategy is fuzzy strategic objectives. This problem manifests itself as: a long list of things to do/accomplish, mislabelled as strategies; a ‘blue sky’ – a restatement of the challenge/desired state of affairs that does not identify ‘how’ to get there.\nGood strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one/very few pivotal objectives, whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.\nGood strategy also creates a link between short-term objectives/action and the long-term strategic goal.\n\nFluff:\n\nPoor strategy is often characterized by ‘fluff’, or superficial abstraction.\nFluff is a restatement of the obvious, combined with a generous sprinkling of buzzwords that masquerade as expertise."

    "text": "Conclusions\n\n\nStrategies have a life cycle, which is coined by waves of change and continuity.\n\nThus, a strategy cannot be a fixed plan, or being updated at a predetermined time.\n\nOverall, the dichotomy between formulation (and strategy-maker) and implementation (and subordinates who implement) makes little sense (Mintzberg 1978).\n\n\n\nFollowing his theoretical and empirical observations, Mintzberg (1978) conclueds that\n\nstrategies have a life cycle spanning from its conception, elaboration, decay, and death; and\nthere are periodic waves of change and continuity within the life cycle.\n\nThus, the assumptions of planning theory that a strategy-maker “formulates” a strategy, while the subordinates implement are often proved false (Mintzberg 1978):\n\nThe formulator is fully informed\nThe environment is sufficiently stable, or at least predictable. Thus, there will be no need for reformulation during implementation.\n\nConsequently, a strategy cannot be a fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at a predetermined time solely at the will of management (e.g., as a result of strategy deviations). Similarly, contingency planning, a popular prescription in times of environmental turmoil, can be risky because plans can tend to come to fruition whether they are needed or not. And so sometimes it can also be risky to make strategy explicit, especially in an uncertain environment with a dominant organizational operating system tending towards stability (Mintzberg 1978).\nMintzberg (1978) instead highlights that strategy formation is not a one-size-fits-all process. Rather, it involves various approaches and patterns, including entrepreneurial, adaptive, planning, and logical incrementalism.\n\nEntrepreneurial approach: Strategy emerges from a single visionary leader.\nAdaptive approach: Strategies evolve incrementally in response to changing circumstances.\nPlanned approach: Formal strategic planning processes drive strategy formulation. Logical incrementalism: A blend of planning and adaptation, where strategies develop incrementally.\n\nConsequently, strategy formation is not limited to formal processes or boardroom decisions. Informal interactions, serendipity, and learning from experience play a significant role. Likewise, aligning organizational actions with formulated strategies can be complex and may require ongoing adjustment.\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived. They are open minded, sensitive to experience and learn about their organisations/industries through personal involvement."

    "text": "Guiding idea\n\nThe process by which effective strategies are created is better captured by thinking of strategy as a craft, rather than as a planning process (Mintzberg 1987).\n\n\nWhy does strategy as a craft better reflect the process by which strategies are formed?\n\n\nCraft involves traditional skill, dedication, mastery of detail through long experience and an intimate understanding of the materials at hand. Formulation and implementation merge into a fluid process of learning through which creativity evolves.\nThe craftsman has an intimate knowledge of his/her work, capabilities and markets. In considering future prospects, they draw upon their past experiences. This knowledge is ‘tacit’–they sense rather than analyse these things.\nSimilarly, effective corporate strategies also evolve through such a creative process. Strategists are craftsmen, who link corporate capabilities to future market opportunities. They use their past experiences, and bring to their work an equally intimate knowledge of the issues they deal with."

    "text": "Tenets\n\nLike potters at the wheel, organizations must make sense of the past if they hope to manage the future. Only by coming to understand the patterns that form in their own behavior do they get to know their capabilities and their potential. Thus crafting stategy, like managing craft, requires a natural synthesis of future, present and past. Mintzberg (1987)\n\n\n\n\nStrategies are both plans for the future and patterns from the past.\nStrategies need not be deliberate—they can also emerge, more or less.\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways.\nStrategic reorientation happen in brief, quantum leaps.\nManaging strategy is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change.\n\n\n\n\nPlans for the future and patterns from the past\nThe term ‘strategy’ is used as much to explain past behavior (pattern in actions over time, or realized strategy) as to describe intended behavior (the plan). A plan need not necessarily produce a pattern. So too, a pattern need not result from a plan.\nStrategies need not be deliberate – they can also emerge, more or less\nThe interplay of strategy formulation and implementation\nA realized strategy can be the result of a deliberate process involving formulation followed by successful implementation. However, it can also emerge as an adaptive response to evolving circumstances.\nWhen planned intentions fall short of achieving desired outcomes, organizations may find themselves with unrealized strategies. This can be attributed to challenges in implementation, but it may also stem from the belief that strategies should be strictly planned rather than allowed to evolve gradually through an organization’s actions and experiences.\nThe synergy of thought and action\nSimilar to how skilled craftspeople seamlessly blend thought and action in their craft, organizations should not separate the aspects of ‘thinking’ and ‘doing’ in strategy.\nStrategy is deeply intertwined with the day-to-day operational details of running an organization. Effective strategy does not exist in isolation but is deeply embedded in the organizational context.\nBalancing control and adaptation\nPurely deliberate strategy formulation can limit an organization’s ability to learn and adapt once the strategy is set in stone. In contrast, emergent strategy allows for ongoing adaptation but may risk losing control.\nAchieving effective strategy making requires a balance between learning and responsiveness on one hand and maintaining a level of control on the other. Therefore, in practice, strategy making often blends deliberate and emergent strategies to strike this balance.\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways\nEffective strategies can take shape through a variety of unconventional and unexpected paths. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategy development.\nSurprising as it may seem, errors can transform into opportunities, limitations can ignite creativity, and even moments of boredom can lead to significant strategic change.\nEmpowering strategy development from the bottom up\nOften strategies originate at lower organizational levels, nurtured by individuals with both technical expertise and a deep understanding of the on-ground realities. With the right resources and a capacity for learning, these locally generated strategies evolve into collective and organizational approaches.\nThese grass-roots strategies are particularly prevalent in businesses that require a high degree of expertise and creative thinking. In these organizations, strategy development is not confined to boardrooms but is embraced at all levels. Technical experts who are intimately familiar with the business’s intricacies play a central role in shaping the strategies that drive success.\nStrategic reorientations happen in brief, quantum leaps\nStrategic reorientation often manifest as abrupt and significant transformations, challenging the traditional perspective that change in an organization should be continuous.\nWhile conventional wisdom suggests continuous adaptation, strategy inherently seeks to establish stability. Organisations pursue a given strategic orientation for most of the time, as they achieve success not by changing strategies, but by exploiting the ones they have. However, when that strategic orientation grows out of sync with its environment over time, revolutionary change must take place. The organisation quickly alters many of its established patterns, as it tries to leap/shift to a new position of stability.\nA crucial aspect of strategy-making is navigating the delicate equilibrium between preserving stability and responding to external changes.\nTo manage strategy, then, is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived. They are open minded, sensitive to experience and learn about their organisations/industries through personal involvement."

It’s crucial to spend time making the current strategy work effectively.\nInstead of fixating on change, it’s more important to know when change is necessary. An excessive focus on change can be counterproductive and disrupt the organization’s balance.\nDetect discontinuity\nMost changes are small and temporary, requiring no major strategic response. Significant environmental changes that demand attention are infrequent but can be identified.\nThe real challenge lies in spotting subtle, unexpected shifts that could threaten the organization’s future. This calls for foresight and active involvement to recognize these irregular changes.\nKnow the business\nStrategic thinking relies on a deep understanding of the business and the creativity to harness that knowledge. Those with this expertise often notice things others miss and seize emerging opportunities.\nManage patterns\nEffective strategy management hinges on the ability to identify emerging patterns and support their development. This might involve creating flexible structures, hiring innovative talent, defining overarching strategies, and observing evolving patterns.\nSome patterns may need careful monitoring until their impact becomes clearer, helping decide whether to make them part of the deliberate strategy.\nReconcile change and continuity\nManagers should aim to strike a balance between change and continuity. An excessive fixation on either can harm the organization in the long run.\nNew patterns should be held in check until the organization is prepared for a significant strategic shift. Moreover, understanding past experiences is essential for navigating the future effectively. Crafting strategy, much like managing a craft, involves synthesizing the past, present, and future."

The external strategic management audit1 focuses on identifying and evaluating environmental trends and events beyond the control of a single firm (David and David 2016).\nThe purpose of an external audit is to develop a finite list of opportunities that could benefit a firm as well as threats that should be avoided. As the term finite suggests, the external audit is not aimed at developing an exhaustive list of every possible factor that could influence the business; rather, it is aimed at identifying key variables that offer actionable responses.\nIdentifying and evaluating external opportunities and threats enables organizations to develop a clear mission, to design strategies to achieve long-term objectives, and to develop policies to achieve annual objectives. Firms should be able to respond either offensively or defensively to the factors by formulating strategies that take advantage of external opportunities or that minimize the impact of potential threats."

    "text": "Overview\n\n\nLong-term, global, and transformative trends that bring about fundamental changes and transformations in various domains and at multiple levels.\n\n\n\nThe concept of megatrends in strategic management refers to long-term, global, and transformative trends that significantly impact various aspects of society, the economy, industries, and organizations. These trends are characterized by their sustained and pervasive influence over many years, often spanning decades. Megatrends shape the business landscape, influence consumer behavior, drive technological innovation, and create both opportunities and challenges for businesses and other stakeholders.\nKey characteristics and aspects of the concept of megatrends include:\n\nLong-term perspective: Megatrends unfold over extended periods, typically spanning 10 to 20 years or more. They represent enduring shifts in societal, economic, and technological dynamics.\nGlobal impact: Megatrends transcend geographical boundaries and affect countries, regions, and industries worldwide. They have a broad and pervasive reach.\nTransformational effects: Megatrends bring about fundamental changes and transformations in various domains, including demographics, technology, environment, politics, and culture. They reshape the way people live, work, and interact.\nCross-industry relevance: Megatrends impact multiple industries and sectors, often requiring organizations to adapt, innovate, and adjust their strategies to remain competitive and relevant.\nStrategic implications: Organizations must consider megatrends in their strategic planning processes. Failure to do so can result in missed opportunities or exposure to risks associated with not aligning with the evolving landscape."
