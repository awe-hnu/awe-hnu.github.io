To identify a company’s distinctive competencies, resources and capabilities must be evaluated by considering four important questions:\n\nThe question of value.\nThe question of rareness.\nThe question of imitability.\nThe question of organisation.\n\n\nThe question of value\nResources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm’s ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues (Barney 1995).\nManagers need to check if the firm’s resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats.\n\nManagers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities.\nManagers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not.\nManagers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors.\nManagers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways.\n\n\n\nThe question of rareness\nResources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage (Barney 1995).\nTherefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them.\n\nIf a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, i.e. it is valuable but common, then it forms a source of competitive parity.\nResources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage.\n\n\n\nThe question of imitability\nResources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes or alternatives for the resource. In other words, competitors cannot easily find a different resource to replace or replicate the unique value of the resource or capability (Barney 1995).\nThus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability identified as valuable and rare face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it, compared to firms that already possess it.\n\nIf a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.\n\nIf competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage.\nImitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources.\n\n\n\nThe question of organization\nThe organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the four VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization to maximize its impact. In addition, resources often work best when they are integrated with other resources and capabilities within the organization (Barney 1995)?\nThus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities.\n\nA firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage arising from the value, rareness and imitability of its resources and capabilities.\nThe firm’s complementary resources – for example, its formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant/important for a firm to realize competitive advantage.\nTo create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation."

Apple’s app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.\n\nApple’s success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. This adaptability and innovation have enabled Apple to consistently deliver products and services that resonate with consumers worldwide."

The theory is then tested using measures that represent variables, and data is collected from real-world phenomena. Figure 3 points to two main challenges in this process.\n\nShared meaning: If the connection between theoretical concepts and measures is unclear, measuring the constructs accurately becomes difficult. Ensuring accurate measurements minimizes data problems. However, without shared meaning, even accurate measurements won’t reflect the intended constructs. For instance, if you’re studying emotions related to technology and you confuse “compassion” with a similar concept like “empathy,” issues arise.\nAaccuracy of measurement: Researchers need accurate data to draw valid conclusions. No matter the analysis, conclusions are unreliable without data reliability.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Measures and measurements based on Burton-Jones and Lee (2017)\n\n\n\n\nPhases and outcomes\n\n\n\n\nPhases and outcomes of the operationalization process\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConceptualization\nConceptualization refers to the definition of fuzzy and imprecise, vague and ambiguous constructs of social science in concrete and precise terms. It aims at ensuring shared meaning about the constructs at the theoretical level. It often requires to separate related constructs conceptually (i.e., providing clear definitions)\nConstruct conceptualization involves identifying and defining what the construct is intended to represent or capture conceptually, discussing how the construct differs from other related constructs, and defining any dimensions or content domains that are relevant to grasping and defining the conceptual theme of the construct it its entirety. Each construct should have (1) a label, (2) a definition, (3) ideally one or more examples that demonstrate its meaning (as a demonstration of face validity), and (4) a discussion of related constructs in the literature. Papers and theses often use construct definition tables for this purpose, where each of the four points becomes a column and each construct in the study has its own row (Recker 2021, 100).\n\n\nNature of constructs\nConstructs can be unidimensional or multidimensional (Wright et al. 2012).\n\nUnidimensional constructs are expected to have a single underlying dimension. They can be measured using a single measure or test. For instance, a person’s weight and age are simple unidimensional constructs.\nMultidimensional constructs consist of two or more underlying dimensions. Each dimension must be measured separately (either reflective or formative). For instance, a persons’ academic ability can be conceptualized as consisting of two dimensions: mathematical and verbal ability.\n\n\n\nFrom the theoretical to the empirical dimension\nOperationalization refers to the development of indicators or items for measuring theoretically defined constructs at the empirical level. For instance, the unobservable theoretical construct “socioeconomic status” could be defined as the ‘level of family income’ and thus operationalized using an indicator (interchangeably used terms: indicator question, item) that asks respondents for the annual family income\nThe combination of indicators at the empirical level representing a given construct is called a variable. Variables may be independent, dependent, mediating or moderating (i.e., the cause, the outcome, the underlying mechanism or condition)\n\n\nScales\nEach indicator may have several attributes (or levels) and each attribute represent a value (e.g., a gender variable may have two attributes).\nCommon rating scales are\n\nNominal scales for categorial data (e.g., gender)\nLikert-type scales for latent constructs, measuring ordinal data by simply-worded statements to which respondents can indicate their extent of agreement (e.g., using Excel would improve my job performance.)\n\n\n\n\n\nReliability and validity\n\n\n\n\nMeeting requirements for validity and reliability (Recker 2021, 93)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Meeting requirements for validity and reliability (Recker 2021, 93)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidity and reliability in research\n\n\n\nInternal validity (causality) examines whether the observed change in a dependent variable is indeed caused by a corresponding change in independent variable, and not by variables outside the research context. Different research designs vary considerably in their respective level of internal validity (e.g., experiments vs. field surveys).\nExternal validity (generalizability) refers to whether the observed associations can be generalized from the sample to the population, or to other people, organizations, contexts, or time (ecological validity).\nReliability refers to the consistency, stability, and reproducibility of measurement or data collection methods. It reflects the extent to which a measurement or research instrument produces consistent results when applied repeatedly under the same conditions.\n\n\nValidity of measurements represent the essence or content upon which the construct is focused, i.e., valid measurements measure what they intend to measure.\n\nTheoretical assessments assess how well an operationalization fits the conceptual definition of the relevant theoretical construct.\n\nFace validity: The indicator seems to be a reasonable measure of its underlying construct (“on its face”). Example: Is annual salary a good measure of job satisfaction? No.\nContent validity: A set of measurement items matches the content domain of the construct.\n\nEmpirical (statistical) assessments of validity, which assess how well a measurement behaves in correspondence to the theoretical predictions. Tests include convergent validity and discriminant validity; see Straub, Boudreau, and Gefen (2004).\n\nReliability describes the extent to which a variable or set of indicators is consistent in what it is intended to measure. If multiple measurements are taken, the reliable measurements will all be very consistent in their values.\n\nThe operations of a study can be repeated in equal settings with the same results\nReliability tries to decrease dependency on researcher’s subjectivity\nThere is a wide range of statistical reliability tests such as internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and composite reliability; see @Straub, Boudreau, and Gefen (2004)\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nTable 1: Scales from TAM (Venkatesh et al. 2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct\nDefinition\nIndicators\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Intention\nParticipant’s intentions\nto use a particular system\nin the future\n- I intend to use the system in the next  months\n- I predict I would use the system in the next  months\n- I plan to use the system in the next  months\n\n\nAttitude towards Behavior\nAn individual’s positive\nor negative feelings about\nperforming the target behavior.\n- Using the system is a bad/good idea\n- Using the system is a foolish/wise idea\n- I dislike/like the idea of using the system\n- Using the system is unpleasant/ pleasant\n\n\nPerceived Usefulness\nThe degree to which a\nperson believes that using\na particular system would\nenhance his or her job\nperformance.\n- Using the system in my job would enable me to accomplish tasks more quickly\n- Using the system would improve my job performance\n- Using the system in my job would increase my productivity\n- Using the system would enhance my effectiveness on the job\n- Using the system would make it easier to do my job\n- I would find the system useful in my job\n\n\nPerceived Ease of Use\nThe degree to which a person\nbelieves that using a system\nwould be free of effort.\n- Learning to operate the system would be easy for me\n- I would find it easy to get the system to do what I want it to do\n- My interaction with the system would be clear and understandable\n- I would find the system to be flexible to interact with\n- It would be easy for me to become skillful at using the system\n- I would find the system easy to use"

    "text": "Measurement development\nAfter having developed a conceptual definition of the construct, the first step is to identify and to develop potential items for the construct (Recker 2021).\nBecause developing and assessing measures and measurement is time-consuming and challenging, the first rule should always be to identify and re-use (wherepossible) measures and measurements that have already been developed and assessed.\nExisting items—best case, you rely on established measures. Look for measurements reported in papers or use a measurement database such as TheoryOn or the Handbook of Management Scales.\nNew items—follow one of the guidelines published. You might start with Recker (2021)’s procedural model to create new measurement instruments for conceptually defined theory constructs.\n\nIf you need to adapt existing items, you should take multiple steps to evaluate and optimize content validity of the items selected/created:\n\nExpert panel:  people with experience about the domain judge whether items appropriately describe the construct\nCard-sorting: experts are asked to sort/rank the items to the constructs of interest. If items are consistently assigned to the intended construct, then there is confidence for ‘content validity’\nRevision: items that are not consistently assigned to the intended construct, need to be rephrased or eliminated. Re-evaluate the items until sufficient ‘content validity’ is achieved\n\nAfter data collection (or best case a pre-study) you need to validate the instrument by statistically check reliability and validity.\n\nExploratory factor analysis (EFA): a method to uncover the underlying structure (constructs) within variables/items – to ‘explore’ the relationships between items. Usually done with the software ‘SPSS’.\nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA): a method to ‘confirm’ that the items measure the target construct and nothing else. Can be done with software like ‘SmartPLS’."

It is often used in disciplines such as management, marketing, information systems, and social sciences to test and validate theoretical models.\nKey features (see e.g., Hair et al. 2019):\n\nLatent variables: Like traditional SEM, PLS-SEM can handle latent variables, which are constructs that cannot be directly observed but are inferred from multiple observed indicators (variables).\nPath modeling: PLS-SEM allows researchers to assess both the measurement model (relationships between latent variables and their indicators) and the structural model (relationships among latent variables). It’s used to test hypotheses about these relationships.\nSmall sample sizes: PLS-SEM is particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes, as it is more robust to violations of normality and distribution assumptions.\nPrediction-oriented: PLS-SEM can be used for predictive purposes, making it suitable for applications where the primary goal is to predict an outcome or estimate relationships, rather than explain complex underlying processes.\nReflective and formative constructs: PLS-SEM can handle both reflective (indicators represent different facets of the same construct) and formative (indicators collectively define the construct) measurement models.\nNon-normal data: PLS-SEM is less sensitive to assumptions of multivariate normality, making it suitable for data that do not follow a normal distribution."

    "text": "Overview\n\nOnce you have your research question well specified, the next challenge is to create an action plan to answer the question and test your theory about the answer. That is what we call a research design.\n\n\n\nThe action plan\n\n\nA research design is the blueprint for the collection, measurement, and analysis of data that\n\n\ntypically requires a combination of reasoning skills such as induction, deduction, and abduction;\nand often involves different research strategies such as exploration, rationalization, and validation (Recker 2021)\n\n\n\n\nExploration:\n\nThe systematic discovery of things or phenomena encountered in common experience. Often involves induction.\n\nRationalization\n\nMaking sense of the puzzle or problem that interests us. Often involves abduction.\n\nValidation\n\nSubjecting an emergent or existing theory to rigorous examination and testing. Often involves deduction.\n\n\nDifferent research methods can be used as a tool to support inductive, deductive, or abductive reasoning.\n\n\n\nDeduction\n\n\nDrawing a conclusion from a general premise to a specific instance: from theory to data.\n\n\n\nDeduction is a form of logical reasoning that involves deriving arguments as logical consequences of a set of more general premises (i.e., justification). It involves deducing a conclusion from a general premise (i.e., a known theory) to a specific instance (i.e., an observation) (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Deduction involves starting with general principles, theories, or hypotheses and deriving specific predictions or conclusions from them.\nProcess: Researchers begin with a set of premises or assumptions and use logical reasoning to draw specific implications or hypotheses.\nPurpose: The primary goal of deduction is to test the validity of a general theory or hypothesis by examining its specific implications.\nProblem: If the premise is incorrect, the deduction becomes invalid.\nExample: If all humans are mortal (general premise), and Socrates is a human (specific premise), then it can be deduced that Socrates is mortal.\n\n\n\n\nInduction\n\n\nInferring a general conclusion from a set of specific observations: from data to theory.\n\n\n\nA form of logical reasoning that involves inferring a general conclusion from a set of specific facts or observations (i.e., formal inference). It is used to infer theoretical concepts and patterns from observed data or known facts to generate new knowledge by proceeding from particulars to generals (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Induction involves deriving general principles, theories, or (tentative) conclusions from specific observations or evidence.\nProcess: Researchers gather specific data or evidence and use it to draw broader patterns, generalizations, or theories.\nProblem: Inductive arguments, which can be weak or strong, cannot be justified, only supported or not supported.\nPurpose: Induction aims to develop new theories, patterns, or generalizations based on observed evidence.\nExample: Observing that all observed swans are white (specific observations) leads to the generalization that all swans are white (general principle).\n\n\n\n\nAbduction\n\n\nMaking sense of an observation by drawing inferences about the best possible explanation: educated guessing.\n\n\n\nAbduction is the process of making sense of an observation by drawing inferences about the best possible explanation for an observed consequence after the fact (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Abduction involves creating plausible explanations or hypotheses to explain observed phenomena.\nProcess: Researchers propose potential explanations for observations or patterns, often guided by existing knowledge or theories.\nPurpose: Abduction is used when faced with surprising or unexpected observations that do not fit existing theories, aiming to generate new hypotheses for further investigation. It is geared toward the discovery of entirely new ideas rather then a mode of justification (through deduction) or formal inference (through induction).\nExample: If a crime scene has fingerprints but no eyewitnesses, and it’s known that criminals often leave fingerprints (existing knowledge), then it’s abductive to hypothesize that a criminal was present."

Good research typically moves back and forth among them, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe emphasis of any one study can be on either end (1,2,3) or in combination (e.g., 4). Often, only so-called research programs (combinations of multiple studies) can achieve all (5).\n\nWe may find that explaining a particular behavior requires that we collect additional observations about other behaviours that we did not identify as relevant to our initial exploration. The interplay between rationalization and exploration can also provide a set of initial evidence against which we can test the outcomes of our rationalization process or evaluate a set of tentative propositions between constructs that capture a phenomenon. The rationalization should be valid in light of any observations that we collected. Once a rationalization, in which tentative general propositions are created through inductive reasoning from observations or through abduction, has been made, we can proceed to validation, where we develop testable hypotheses or propositions for a particular context or scenario from our more general theory. These hypotheses can be subjected to further empirical tests using new or existing cases. The results or evidence collected may suggest that we revise our rationalization (moving from validation back to rationalization), which could involve abduction. For example, our validation may find an observable mechanism that speaks against the logic of our propositions, requiring us to make an educated guess about why it happened or how these observations can otherwise be explained.

    "text": "Reimagine your temperament\n\n\nI run out of willpower. You can do it if you really want (and tell yourself).\n\n\n\nMany studies offer evidence for a phenomenon called ego depletion—the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up (Baumeister and Tierney 2012). Some researchers also concluded that self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source (i.e., the fuel in our willpower tank).\nBelieving we do run out of willpower makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.\nHowever, only recently Job et al. (2013) concluded that only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. People how did not see willpower as a finite resource did not show signs of ego depletion.\nThere is also the viewpoint that willpower acts like an emotion. Just as we don’t “run dry” of joy or anger, willpower fluctuates depending on what is happening to us and how we are feeling. Eyal (2019, 51) does concludes that “if mental energy is more like an emotion than fuel in a tank, it can be managed and utilized as such”.\nWhat we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control (e.g., the cravings are stronger then my willpower) actually leads to less self-control.\nImplications:\nBelief in your willpower and practice self-compassion, because people how do not see their willpower as limited resource and are more self-compassionate are more resilient."

    "text": "Structure\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example: A partial search tree for finding a route from Arad to Bucharest; based on Russel and Norvig (2022)\n\n\n\nFigure 2 visualizes a partial search tree: the first few steps in finding a path from Arad (initial state) to Bucharest (goal).\n\nThe root node of the search tree is the initial state \\(s\\) (Arad)\nThe available actions considerd using \\(ACTIONS(s)\\)\nNew nodes, called child nodes or successor nodes are generated using \\(RESULT(s,a)\\) (i.e., the root node is expanded)\nEach child node has Arad as its parent node\nThe child node to be considered next is selected by the minimum value of some evaluation function \\(f(n)\\) (strategies see below)\n\nIn Figure 2, nodes that have been expanded are white with bold letters; nodes on the frontier that have been generated but not yet expanded are in white and regular letters; the set of states corresponding to these two types of nodes are said to have been reached. Nodes that could be generated next are shown in faint dashed lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of search trees\n\n\n\nA search tree is a “what if” tree of plans and their outcomes.\n\nThe start state is the root node,\nchildren correspond to successors,\nnodes show states, but correspond to PLANS that achieve those states\n\nThere are lots of repeated structure in the search tree. Thus, for most problems, the whole tree can never be actually built. In practice, both state space graphs and search trees are constructed on demand and as little as possible (Russel and Norvig 2022).\n\n\nSearch algorithms require a data structure to keep track of the search tree. A node in the tree is represented by a data structure with four components (Russel and Norvig 2022, 91):\n\n\\(node.STATE\\): the state to which the node corresponds\n\\(node.PARENT\\): the node in the tree that generated this node\n\\(node.ACTION\\): the action that was applied to the parent’s state to generate this node\n\\(node.PATH-COST\\): the total cost of the path from the initial state to generate this node\n\nFollowing the PARENT pointers back from a node allows to revocer the states and actions along the path to that node. Doing this from a goal node generates the solution.\n\nExample data structure in pseudo code:\nvar searchTree = {\n  node.STATE: \"Bucharest\"\n  node.PARENT: {\n    node.STATE: \"Pitesti\"\n    node.PARENT: {\n      node.STATE: \"Rimmicu Vilcea\"\n      node.PARENT: {\n        node.STATE: \"Sibiu\"\n        node.PARENT: {\n          node.STATE: \"Arad\"\n          node.PARENT: NULL\n          node.ACTION: NULL\n          node.PATH-COST: 0\n        }\n        node.ACTION: \"Arad to Sibiu\"\n        node.PATH-COST: 140\n      }\n      node.ACTION: \"Sibiu to Rimmicu Vilcea\"\n      node.PATH-COST: 220\n    }\n    node.ACTION: \"Rimmicu Vilcea to Pitesti\"\n    node.PATH-COST: 317\n  }\n  node.ACTION: \"Pitesti to Bucharest\"\n  node.PATH-COST: 418\n}\n\nIn addition, a data structure to store the fontier is neded. Usually this is realized using a queue with following functions (Russel and Norvig 2022, 91):\n\n\\(IS-EMPTY(frontier)\\): returns true only if there are no nodes in the frontier\n\\(POP(frontier)\\): removes the top node from the frontier and returns it\n\\(TOP(frontier)\\): returns (but does not remove) the top node from the frontier\n\\(ADD(node,frontier)\\): inserts node into its proper place in the queue"

measured in seconds or by the number of states and actions considered)?\nSpace complexity: How much memory is needed to perform the search?"

In a sliding tile puzz_le, for instance, you either have the correct alignment of tiles or you do not.\nA factored representation is one in which the states are defined by set of features (e.g., Boolean, real-valued, or one of a fixed set of symbols). In a sliding puzzle, this might be a simple heuristic like “number of tiles out of place”.\nA structured representation is one in which the states are expressed in form of objects and relations between them (e.g., expressed by logic or probability). Such knowledge about relations called facts.\n\nThe more expressive language is much more concise, but makes reasoning and learning more complex."

    "text": "Utility-based agents\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A model-based, utility-based agent\n\n\n\nA model-based, utility-based agent uses a model of the world, along with a utility function that measures its preferences among states of the world. It chooses the action that leads to the best expected utility, where expected utility is computed by averaging over all possible states, weighted by the probability of the outcome (Russel and Norvig 2022, 73).\nThe utility function is essentially an internalization of the performance measure.\nA utility-based agent has many advantages in terms of flexibility and learning, which are particularly helpful in environments characterized by partial observability and nondeterminism.\nIn addition, there are cases where the goals are insufficient but a utility-based agent can still make rational decisions based on the probabilities and the utilities of the outcomes:\n\nWhen there are conflicting goals, the utility function specifies the appropriate tradeoff.\nLikelihood of success (i.e., goal achievement) can be weighed against the importance of the goals\n\nModel- and utility-based agents are difficult to implement. They need to model and keep track of the task environment, which requires ingenious sensors, sophisticated algorithms, and a high computational complexity.\nThere are also utility-based agents that are not model-based. These agents just learn what action is best in a particular situation without any “understanding” of its impact on the environment (e.g., based on reinforcement learning).\n\nMain differences\nThe main difference between simple reflex agents and model-based reflex agents is that the latter keep track of the state of the world. Model-based reflex agents generate knowledge about how the world evolves independently of the agent and how actions of the agent change the world (i.e., they have knowledge about “how the world works”). This knowledge is “stored” in the transition model of the world. A model-based reflex agents still decides on condition-action rules which action to take (i.e., the codified reflexes).\nThe main difference between model-based reflex agents and goal-based agents is that it does not act on fixed condition-action rules, but on some sort of goal information that describes situations that are desirable (e.g., in the case of route-finding the destination). Based on the goal, the best possible action (based on the knowledge of the world), needs to be selected. Goal-based decision making involves consideration of the future based on the transition model (i.e., “what will happen if I do such-and-such?”) and how it helps to achieve the goal. In reflex agents designs, this information I not explicitly represented, because the built rules map directly from the percepts to actions, without considering/knowing the future state.\nThe main difference between goal-based agents and utility-based agents is that the performance measure is more general. It does not only consider a binary distinction between “goal achieved” and “goal not achieved” but allows comparing different world states according to their relative utility or expected utility, respectively (i.e., how happy the agent is with the resulting state). Utility-based agents can still make rational decisions when there are conflicting goals for which only one can be achieved (here the utility function needs to specify a trade-off) and when there are several goals that the agent can aim for, none of which can be achieved with certainty (here the utility function provides a which in which the likelihood of success can be weighed against the importance of the goals, e.g., speed and energy consumption in routing).\nExample: a goal-based agent for routing just selects actions based on a single, binary goal: reaching the destination; a utility-based agents also considers additional goals like spending as less time as possible on the road, spending as less money as possible, having the best scenery on the trip, etc. and tries to maximize overall utility across these goals. In this example, reaching the destiny is the ultimate goal, without achieving that utility would be zero. However, utility will increase or decrease related to how the actions chosen impact the achievement of the other goals, which importance need to be weighed."

Thus, learning agents have greater autonony.\nA learning agent consists of four conceptual components (Russel and Norvig 2022, p- 74-75), as shown in Figure 6:\n\nThe performance element is responsible for taking percepts and selecting actions (i.e., what has previously been considered the entire agent program).\nThe learning element is responsible for improvements. It uses feedback from the critic on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element should be modified to do better in the future. It can make changes to any of the “knowledge components” shown in the agent diagrams (i.e., condition-action-rules, transition model, sensor model)\nThe performance standard is responsible to inform the agent about the meaning of percepts — are they good nor not (e.g., the meaning of receiving no tips from passengers is a negative contribution to an automated taxis’s overall performance). The standard is fixed and cannot be influenced by the agent.\nThe problem generator is responsible for suggesting actions that lead to new and informative experiences. The problem generator suggests exploratory actions that may be suboptimal in the short term, but can lead to the discovery of better actions in the long term."

Der wissenschaftliche Diskurs zeigt jedoch, dass die Strategie und das Geschäftsmodell eines Unternehmens nicht identisch sind, sondern sich voneinander unterscheiden.\nEine Unternehmensstrategie legt langfristige Ziele sowie grundsätzliche Maßnahmen fest, diese zu erreichen. Basis für die langfristige Ausrichtung eines Unternehmens sind sowohl dessen interne Stärken und Schwächen als auch die unternehmensexternen Chancen und Risiken der Umwelt. Die Stärken eines Unternehmens sollen mit den Chancen der Umwelt in Einklang gebracht werden, wobei gleichzeitig die eigenen Schwächen verringert und die externen Risiken vermieden werden sollen. Kurzum: Strategie beschreibt, wie sich ein Unternehmen gegenüber Konkurrenten durchsetzen kann.\nDahingegen beschreibt das Geschäftsmodell auf abstrakter Ebene wie die Unternehmensressourcen so koordiniert werden, so dass Wert geschaffen wird oder in Zukunft geschaffen werden soll. Aus dem Geschäftsmodell lassen sich dann die spezifischen Geschäftsprozesse ableiten. Diese beschreiben im Detail, wie mit Hilfe von Tätigkeitsketten aus verschiedenen Produktionsfaktoren (Input) ein spezifisches Ergebnis (Output) erzeugt wird.\nStrategien unterscheiden sich von Geschäftsmodellen also insbesondere darin, dass Strategien zukunftsorientiert sind und eine langfristige Perspektive verfolgen, wohingegen Geschäftsmodelle eher gegenwartsbezogen sind und die aktuelle Logik zur Erzeugung von Wert beschreiben. Eine Strategie kann zu unterschiedlichen Geschäftsmodellen führen, ein Geschäftsmodell ist deshalb nur eine mögliche Abbildung der Strategie.\nDas Unternehmen, die eine gleiche Strategie verfolgen, diese durch unterschiedliche Geschäftsmodelle umsetzen können zeigt sich unter anderem bei Fluggesellschaften. Fluggesellschaften wie Ryanair und Eurowings verfolgen eine Wettbewerbsstrategie, die als Preisführerschaft bezeichnet wird (low-cost Airlines). Die Unternehmen unterscheiden sich aber in der Art und Weise, wie sie ihr Geschäftsmodell konzipiert haben. Unterschiede lassen sich z.B. hinsichtlich des Partnernetzwerkes (Eurowings ist Teil der Lufthansa Gruppe), des Codesharings, sowie des Kundenservices feststellen."

Diese Dimension beschreibt, welche Kunden(segmente) anvisiert werden, was die Produkte und Dienstleistungen für die Kunden wertvoll macht und wie die Kunden gewonnen und gehalten werden sollen.

Reicht es nicht aus, sich auf die Strategie und die Geschäftsprozesse zu fokussieren?\nRichtig ist, dass es Schnittmengen zwischen Geschäftsstrategie, Geschäftsmodell und Geschäftsprozessen gibt. Jedoch stellen Geschäftsstrategie, -modell und -prozesse verschiedene Informationsebenen dar, die für unterschiedliche Zwecke nützlich sind. Das Geschäftsmodell kann als eine Schnittstelle zwischen der Unternehmensstrategie und den Geschäftsprozessen sowie der unterstützenden Informationssysteme betrachtet werden.\nDie Geschäftsstrategie stellt die Entscheidungen dar, die Unternehmen treffen, um besser abzuschneiden als ihre Konkurrenten. Das Geschäftsmodell beschreibt, wie die Teile eines Unternehmens zusammenspielen, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen.\nInsbesondere in einem Umfeld, das sich durch ein hohes Maß an Komplexität und schnellem Wandel kennzeichnet, sind Unternehmen verstärkt darauf angewiesen, das Potenzial eines Unternehmens (Organisation und Technologie) mit dem Plan zur Realisierung von wirtschaftlichen Werten (Strategie) zu verbinden. Diese Brücke stellt das Geschäftsmodell dar.\nDas Geschäftsmodell wird somit zu einer Art Blaupause für die Art und Weise, wie ein Unternehmen aus neuen Dienstleistungen, Produkten oder Innovationen Wert schafft. Analog zu den Überlegungen im Kapitel IT-Management lässt sich daraus schlussfolgern, dass heute nicht die Technologien, sondern die sinnvolle Nutzung und Kombination dieser Technologien den Erfolg von Unternehmen bestimmen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeschäftsmodell\nStrategie\n\n\n\n\nOrientierung\nKundennutzen und (kooperativen) Wertschöpfung\nWettbewerb, Umfeld und Branchenlogik\n\n\nZielsetzung\nUmsetzung von Strategien; nachhaltige Unternehmenssicherung; kontinuierliche Anpassung/Innovation des Geschäftsmodells\nAufbau und Aufrechterhaltung von Wettbewerbsvorteilen, um den Erfolg zu sichern; Differenzierung gegenüber dem Wettbewerb; Anpassung an das sich ständig wandelnde Umfeld\n\n\nInhalt\nBeschreibung der Wertschöpfung über Wertversprechen, Wertschöpfungsarchitektur, Partnernetzwerk und Ertragsmodell; Anpassungsmöglichkeiten an interne und externe Veränderungen\nLangfristiges Ziel und Richtung; umfassende Ist-Analyse und bewusste Planung der zukünftigen Aktivitäten unter Berücksichtigung externer und interner Faktoren (bspw.

Those who stay on the left side will have many ideas and possibilities to work with, but they will not be able to turn them into new and useful solutions; instead, conflict and chaos will reign.

    "text": "Motivation\n\nSociety often associates leaders with individuals that have grandiose titles, a large corner office, and make world-changing decisions. Thus, many people shy away from identifying themselves as a leader. However, real leadership can be seen most clearly in the small moments throughout the day.\n\nLeadership is about behaving in a way that makes the life of another person better than before you arrived. Drew Dudley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral remarks\nThis module helps you to deepen your understanding of the requirements of leadership in the digital age — from leading oneself, to leading employees and leading systems.\nTo achieve that, you will read a bunch of scientific papers, apply some of the findings in (group) exercises and, best case, reflect your own behavior.\nAs a graded exam assignment, you will research a theory/theoretical construct related to leadership, explain it to the class, and critically discuss its value to leadership practice.\nIt is very important that you prepare yourself for the classes (see Table 1 for details).\n\n\nContents\nThe following topics will be discussed in order to identify and reflect on challenges and opportunities in different leadership roles and situations:\n\n\nChallenges of leading in the digital age (e.g., VUCA, role of technology, etc.)\nBasics of leadership (e.g., motivation, leadership characteristics, etc.)\nTheories (e.g., resources and demand theory, identities at work, trust, psychological safety, etc.)\nDigital leadership tools (workshop tactics and storytelling, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nDuring this course, you should improve your ability to consciously use, reflect on and further develop your leadership skills in your day-to-day work, in particular with regard to\n\n\nLeadership requirements in the context of digital transformation,\nIdentification of and reflection on challenges and opportunities in your own leadership role,\nUnderstanding of the facets of different personality types,\nBasic understanding of characteristics of sustainable organizational systems, and\nLead hierarchically and laterally using digital leadership tools.\n\n\n\n\nEffort\nYou will gain 5 ECTS for this course. This equals approx. 150 hours workload, of which you need most to pass the course.\n\n\nClasses (approx. 30 hours)\nPreparation and follow-up (approx. 15 hours)\nPreparation of the presentation (remaining time)\n\n\n\nPlease prepare your schedule accordingly.\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\nIt is of importance that you prepare yourself for the sessions and work on the case study continually.

This allows, for instance, human domain experts to deal with so called ‘‘broken-leg’’ predictions that deviate from the currently known probability distribution. However, they are restricted by bound rationality that prevents them from aggregating information perfectly and drawing conclusions from that. On the other hand, machines are particularly good at solving repetitive tasks that require fast processing of huge amounts of data, at recognizing complex patterns, or weighing multiple factors following consistent rules of probability theory (Dellermann et al. 2019).\nHowever, there is also a technology-centric perspective that assumes that true intelligence can ultimately only be found in well-developed and mature (general) AI systems. Humans are biologically limited in their information processing and reasoning abilities and exhibit many types of cognitive biases, while computers offer virtually infinite possibilities to develop rational intelligence at human levels and beyond (Peeters et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel of human cognition\n\n\n\nKahneman (2011) proposed a two-system model of human cognition, which he called System 1 and System 2.\nSystem 1 is an intuitive, automatic, and fast mode of thinking that operates outside of our conscious awareness. It is responsible for generating impressions, making quick judgments, and executing routine tasks with minimal effort.\nSystem 2, on the other hand, is a more analytical, controlled, and deliberate mode of thinking that requires conscious effort and attention. It is responsible for problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making.\nWhile System 1 operates quickly and automatically, it can be prone to biases and errors, particularly in complex or unfamiliar situations. System 2, though slower and more effortful, can help us avoid these biases and make more accurate decisions."

Posting the idea opens a discussion thread. Subsequent participants can then either contribute by adding comments to a posted idea, or post their own idea to start a new discussion thread. In the various crowdsourcing experiences, there may be little discussion of an idea (as in Heineken’s Beer Challenge) or there may be many comments and responses (as in Threadless). Because the architectures generally require that an idea be posted to start a discussion (rather than posting facts or some other generative response), the discussion is usually focused on refining a posted idea and rarely on recombining existing posts into new ideas. As a result, ideas are rarely significantly changed by combination and recombination. These discussions can be moderated or not (Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013, 259).\nAnother variation of the architecture for innovation production in crowdsourcing is the way the crowd votes: In many architectures, the crowd is asked to vote on each idea submitted, which accelarates the cycle times. Without voting on the crowd’s most preferred ideas, it would take a sponsoring organization countless hours to review each idea, while the crowd voting speeds up the evaluation of experimental ideas (Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013, 259)."

The crowdsourcing effort is then usually referred to as an innovation tournament or innovation contest or idea tournament.\nIn contribution-based crowdsourcing, incentives are given for the process by which the crowd participates in the crowdsourcing challenge (e.g., the number of comments on others’ ideas). Depending on the type of production process being promoted, the sponsoring organization may be particularly concerned with encouraging sufficient crowd activity on the crowdsourcing platform. In this case, incentives can be created based on the number of published contributions. These incentives may be for the best contributor in terms of number of posts or number of ideas posted.\n\n\nIn for-profit crowdsourcing projects, both types usually include that the members exchange IP for the opportunity to win a prize.\n\nParticipants are often informed that, when the sponsor is a for-profit entity and the crowd is the general public, the sponsoring company owns all intellectual rights. Essentially, members of the crowd are giving up their intellectual property rights in exchange for the opportunity to win the prizes. In contrast, with ‘‘captive’’ or ‘‘closed’’ communities in which individuals have been specially selected to be a member of the community because of their interests and expertise, winners often retain some intellectual property Majchrzak and Malhotra (2013)]."

Leadership emergence is a within-group phenomenon. In contrast, leadership effectiveness represents a between-groups phenomenon.\nRegarding these two constructs and personality trais, the meta-analysis of Judge et al. (2002) shows that:\n\nThe Big Five typology is a fruitful basis for examining the dispositional predictors of leadership.\nExtraversion is the most important trait of leaders and effective leadership.\nExtraversion is more strongly related to leader emergence than to leader effectiveness.\nAfter Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience were the strongest and most consistent correlates of leadership.\nConscientiousness ist more strongly related to leader emergence than to leadership effectiveness.\nAgreeableness was the least relevant trait.\nNeuroticism failed to emerge as a significant predictor of leadership.\nOverall, the traits are better predictors in situations in which individuals have only limited opportunity to observe leadership behaviors (i.e., student samples).\n\nHowever, the results may simply indicate a close correspondence between the way we see peoples personalities and our stereotypical conceptions of the characteristics of leaders."

He identified multiple competing demands and views between members within the organization and across various levels of the organization. He showed that these reflect different values of individuals and often different cultures which had become embedded in parts of and across organizations. Quinn (1988) set out his attempt to develop an integrating framework that could capture these in a meaningful way, with different mixes of paradoxes and contradictions at each point in time, and to show how individuals and organisations could better appreciate the circumstances and move forward.\nQuinn (1988) distilled the competing values in a framework with two dimensions and resulting four quadrants. The dimensions express the tensions or competing values that characterize all organisations. One axis represents the continuum between flexibility or adaptability and stability or control. The other axis describes the continuum between efficient internal processes, such as human resource practices or internal control systems, and external positioning vis-à-vis stakeholders such as competitors, customers and clients. Each continuum highlights performance criteria that are opposite to the other end of the continuum, such as internal versus external alignment (horizontal axis) or flexibility versus stability (vertical axis).\nThe main characteristics of the clan culture, so called because it resembles a family-like orientation, include empowerment, team building and employee participation; the main characteristics of the adhocracy culture include adaptability, creativity and risk-taking; this type of culture is often found in innovative industries. The main characteristics of hierarchy culture include standardisation, predictability and multiple levels of management; the authors suggest that this type of culture is usually found in government agencies. Finally, Cameron and Quinn (2006) suggest that market culture, with its characteristic outward orientation and competitive attitude, is often found in organisations operating in unstable and crowded operating environments.\nThe four orientations are intuitively appealing, perhaps confirming their origin in psychological archetypes; most people can probably find the culture of their current organisation somewhere in this taxonomy. However, as the academic labels for thein each quadrant are often misunderstood, it has proven useful to substitute more accessible and commonly used verbs to describe the dominant activities that relate to each culture—collaborate, create, compete, and control (Lavine 2014).\nThe model further groups two of the leadership roles in each of the four quadrants. The upper right quadrant, which the framework links to open systems theory and the process of adapting to the external environment of the organisation, defines two leadership roles:\n\nThe innovator is creative and surrounds, encourages and facilitates change.\nThe broker is politically astute, acquires resources and maintains the external legitimacy of the entity by building, scanning and maintaining a network of external contacts.\n\nMoving clockwise to the lower right quadrant, two other leadership roles are specified. These roles emphasize the rational pursuit of goals that are external to the group and the role of the leader in defining and motivating the achievement of these goals.\n\nThe producer is the task-oriented, work-driven role. The producer seeks closure and motivates the behaviors that lead to the completion of the group task\nThe director sets goals, clarifies the role, sets targets and formulates clear expectations.\n\nThe lower left quadrant is called the internal process model and focuses on internal control and stability. Two additional leadership roles are defined in this quadrant:\n\nThe coordinator maintains the structure, plans, coordinates and resolves problems, and ensures compliance with rules and standards.\nThe monitor collects and distributes information, reviews performance and ensures continuity and stability.\n\nThe upper left quadrant is referred to in the framework as the human relations quadrant, which focuses on human interaction and process. Within this quadrant, two final leadership roles are defined:\n\nThe facilitator encourages the expression of opinions, seeks consensus and negotiates compromises.\nThe mentor is aware of individual needs, actively listens, is fair, supports legitimate concerns and seeks to promote the development of the individual."

Often organizations need both stability and change at the same time. In contrast to earlier approaches, the development of the competing values framework did not assume that stability and change were mutually exclusive, an either/or decision. Quinn et al. (2020, p. 12)\n\nLeadership qualities seem to be best demonstrated by more movement throughout the framework, suggesting complex adaptation to changing circumstances (Denison, Hooijberg, and Quinn 1995).\nThe CVF provides a description of roles and behaviors to encourage self-reflection and to provide a preliminary sense of behaviors and accompanying roles that can be learned.\nWorking to overcome areas of relative weakness so that they can be transformed into average or adequate performance can help leaders see more opportunities for action when core areas of strength are not delivering the desired results."

In diesem Modell werden unter anderem Mindestanforderungen an Datensätze definiert, die von jedem Anwendungssystem implementiert werden müssen (bspw. Struktur der Kundennummer). Diese erleichtern unter anderem den automatischen Abgleich von Daten.\nProzessmodelle und Organigrammen beschreiben die Funktionen und Abläufe eines Unternehmens (Organisationsarchitektur) und welche Informationssysteme für welche Aufgaben eingesetzt werden."

Search engines also use clustering techniques. Likewise, other functionalities provided by a search engines use intelligent techniques; for instance, the spelling corrector uses a form of data mining based on observing users’ corrections of their own spelling errors. On the other hand, the problem of indexing billions of web pages in a way that allows retrieval in seconds is a problem in database design, not in artificial intelligence.\nTo a limited extent. Voice-activated telephone menus tend to use vocabularies which are very limited – e.g. the digits, “Yes”, and “No” — and within the designers’ control, which greatly simplifies the problem. On the other hand, the programs must deal with an uncontrolled space of all kinds of voices and accents. Modern digital assistants like Siri and the Google Assistant make more use of artificial intelligence techniques, but still have a limited repetoire.\nInternet routing algorithms are borderline. There is something to be said for viewing these as intelligent agents working in cyberspace. The task is sophisticated, the information available is partial, the techniques are heuristic (not guaranteed optimal), and the state of the world is dynamic. All of these are characteristic of intelligent activities. On the other hand, the task is very far from those normally carried out in human cognition.

Anyone who has written a program with an ornery bug knows this, as does anyone who has written a successful machine learning program. So in one sense Samuel “told” the computer “learn to play checkers better than I do, and then play that way,” but in another sense he told the computer “follow this learning algorithm” and it learned to play.

An agent that only senses partial information could be rational, consider an agent whose performance measure is based on its ability to stay completely static in an environment where there are no other agents, such an agent could be perfectly rational even if it did not have any sensors at all. Granted, such an agent would not be very interesting but it would indeed be rational.\n\n\n\nThere exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.\n\nTrue. A pure reflex agent ignores previous percepts, so cannot obtain an optimal state estimate in a partially observable environment. Consider a partially unobservable task environment where the performance measure is based on the agent’s extent of exploration. Now assume that this agent is purely reflex, only responding when it’s world state changes, since its performance measure is to explore but its actions are conditional upon change around it then the agent waits for its state to change but it never will because it is the agent’s entire job is to change its state.\n\n\n\nThere exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.\n\nTrue. Consider an environment that disables all agent’s actuators, rendering them immobile (e.g., an environment with a single state). Regardless of what performance measures these agents possessed they are still judged as rational because they are physically incapable of performing anything.\n\n\n\nEvery agent is rational in an unobservable environment.\n\nFalse. Some actions are stupid—and the agent may know this if it has a model of the environment—even if one cannot perceive the environment state.\n\n\n\nThere is a model-based reflex agent that can remember all of its percepts.\n\nTrue. There could be one, but usually, it keeps the model. A model-based reflex agent is one that uses internal memory and a percept history to create a model of the environment in which it’s operating and make decisions based on that model. The term percept means something that has been observed or detected by the agent. The model-based reflex agent stores the past percepts in its memory and uses them to create a model of the environment. The agent then uses this model to determine which action should be taken in any given situation.\n\n\n\nA perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.\n\nFalse. Due to the partially observable, multi-agent, stochastic, sequential, static and discrete nature of poker, even a perfectly rational agent could not possibly win every game unless the agent is completely omniscient, there are too many factors contributing to the complexity of the task environment that are beyond the agent’s scope of influence. Although, these things are true, let us not discount the fact that the agent could be a learning agent and improve its ability to play but it would still probably lose."

There might be a slight influence from “provenance” information (date, authorship, etc.) that may not be directly observable.\nSkin cancer diagnosis can sometimes be done well from an image of the lesion, bot other factors such as patient age, changes in the lesion over time, medical history, and family history can be important.\nDriving is often considered to be observable because we imagine that we are making decisions based on what we see, but (1) velocity and turn signal status of other vehicles can be judged only from multiple image frames, and (2) assessing the intended actions of other vehicles may require accumulating information over an extended period—e.g., to determine if a vehicle is stopped or broken down, driving slowly or looking for an address or a parking spot, turning left or has forgotten to turn off the turn signal. Other vehicles, hedges, fog, and so on can obscure visual access to important aspects of the driving environment.\nTutoring is almost completely unobservable: what matters is the student’s level of understanding, learning style, basic math skills, etc. clues must be gathered over days, weeks, and months.\n\nContinuous: climate engineering &gt; driving &gt; spoken conversation &gt; written conversation.\n\nClimate engineering by aerosol injection is quintessentially continuous: the engineer must decide how much to inject, where, and when, and all of these are continuous quantities.\nThe control actions of driving are mostly continuous (steering, acceleration/ braking) but there are discrete elements (turn signal, headlights). More importantly, the problem is usually handled using discrete high-level actions (change lanes left, take exit, etc.) that have implementations as continuous control problems. This kind of discrete/ continuous hierarchy is very common; playing chess in the physical world is a perfect example.\nSpoken conversation is closer to chess than driving: roughly speaking, we choose the discrete words to say and delegate the saying to continuous motor control routines. Prosody (volume, pitch, and speed variation) is, however, an important continuous element in how we speak that is largely absent from written communication.\n\nStochastic: poker &gt; soccer &gt; driving &gt; sudoku.\n\nIn poker, nearly everything is determined by the fall of the cards, which is entirely stochastic from the viewpoint of the players.\nBoth soccer and driving contain elements that are fairly deterministic, such as the flight of the ball and the response of the engine, and elements that are stochastic, such as tire punctures and the outcomes of tackles. Yet typically one can make reasonably reliable driving plans over many minutes, whereas it is essentially impossible to predict the state of a soccer game one minute into the future. Sudoku, of course, is entirely deterministic.\n\nStatic: tax planning &gt; checkers &gt; chat room &gt; tennis.\n\nWhile no human activity is completely static, given the finite length of our lifetimes, tax planning comes close—the typical “deadline” to get it done is often weeks or months, and the relevant aspects of the environment (life/death, number of offspring, tax law) may change even more slowly.\nIn checkers, the world state doesn’t change until someone moves, but the clock ticks so the problem is semi-dynamic.\nIn the chat room, long delays in replying are unacceptable, so it is a fairly real-time environment, but not nearly as real-time as tennis, where a delay of a split second often makes the difference between winning and losing a point."

Name three such simplifications we made.\n\n\nProblem statement\n\nThe center of the maze is at (0; 0), and the maze itself is a square from (-1;-1) to (1; 1).\nInitial state: robot at coordinate (0; 0), facing North.\nGoal test: either jxj &gt; 1 or jyj &gt; 1 where (x; y) is the current location.\nSuccessor function: move forwards any distance d; change direction robot it facing.\nCost function: total distance moved.\n\nThe state space is infinitely large, since the robot’s position is continuous.\n\n\nReformulated problem statement\nThe state will record the intersection the robot is currently at, along with the direction it’s facing. At the end of each corridor leaving the maze we will have an exit node. We’ll assume some node corresponds to the center of the maze.\n\nInitial state: at the center of the maze facing North.\nGoal test: at an exit node.\nSuccessor function: move to the next intersection in front of us, if there is one; turn to face a new direction.\nCost function: total distance moved.\n\nThere are 4n states, where n is the number of intersections.\n\n\nReformulated problem statement #2\n\nInitial state: at the center of the maze.\nGoal test: at an exit node.\nSuccessor function: move to next intersection to the North, South, East, or West.\nCost function: total distance moved.\n\nWe no longer need to keep track of the robot’s orientation since it is irrelevant to predicting the outcome of our actions, and not part of the goal test. The motor system that executes this plan will need to keep track of the robot’s current orientation, to know when to rotate the robot.\n\nAbstractions\nState:\n\nIgnoring the height of the robot off the ground, whether it is tilted off the vertical.\nThe robot can face in only four directions.\nOther parts of the world ignored: possibility of other robots in the maze, the weather in the Caribbean.\n\nAction:\n\nWe assumed all positions we safely accessible: the robot couldn’t get stuck or damaged.\nThe robot can move as far as it wants, without having to recharge its batteries.\nSimplified movement system: moving forwards a certain distance, rather than controlled each individual motor and watching the sensors to detect collisions."

    "text": "I2AI_7 E1\nThe first step is to appreciate the variety of knowledge that goes under the heading “language.”\nThe infant must learn to recognize and produce speech, learn vocabulary, learn grammar, learn the semantic and pragmatic interpretation of a speech act, and learn strategies for disambiguation, among other things.\nThe performance elements for this (in humans) and their associated learning mechanisms are obviously very complex and as yet little is known about them.\nA naive model of the learning environment considers just the exchange of speech sounds. In reality, the physical context of each utterance is crucial: a child must see the context in which “watermelon” is uttered in order to learn to associate “watermelon” with watermelons.\nThus, the environment consists not just of other humans but also the physical objects and events about which discourse takes place. Auditory sensors detect speech sounds, while other senses (primarily visual) provide information on the physical context. The relevant effectors are the speech organs and the motor capacities that allow the infant to respond to speech or that elicit verbal feedback.\nThe performance standard could simply be the infant’s general utility function, however that is realized, so that the infant performs reinforcement learning to perform and respond to speech acts so as to improve its well-being—for example, by obtaining food and attention.\nHowever, humans’ built-in capacity for mimicry suggests that the production of sounds similar to those produced by other humans is a goal in itself. The child (once he or she learns to differentiate sounds and learn about pointing or other means of indicating salient objects) is also exposed to examples of supervised learning: an adult says “shoe” or “belly button” while indicating the appropriate object. So sentences produced by adults provide labelled positive examples, and the response of adults to the infant’s speech acts provides further classification feedback.\nMostly, it seems that adults do not correct the child’s speech, so there are very few negative classifications of the child’s attempted sentences. This is significant because early work on language learning, such as the work of Gold (1967) concentrated just on identifying the set of strings that are grammatical, assuming a particular grammatical formalism. If there are only positive examples, then there is nothing to rule out the grammar \\(S \\implies Word\\). Some theorists (notably Chomsky and Fodor) used what they call the “poverty of the stimulus” argument to say that the basic universal grammar of languages must be innate, because otherwise (given the lack of negative examples) there would be no way that a child could learn a language (under the assumptions of language learning as learning a set of grammatical strings). Critics have called this the “poverty of the imagination” argument—I can’t think of a learning mechanism that would work, so it must be innate. Indeed, if we go to probabilistic context free grammars, then it is possible to learn a language without negative examples.\n\nWhat with learning tennis?\nLearning tennis is much simpler than learning to speak. The requisite skills can be divided into movement, playing strokes, and strategy.\nThe environment consists of the court, ball, opponent, and one’s own body. The relevant sensors are the visual system and proprioception (the sense of forces on and position of one’s own body parts). The effectors are the muscles involved in moving to the ball and hitting the stroke.\nThe learning process involves both supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning occurs in acquiring the predictive transition models, e.g., where the opponent will hit the ball, where the ball will land, and what trajectory the ball will have after one’s own stroke (e.g., if I hit a half-volley this way, it goes into the net, but if I hit it that way, it clears the net).\nReinforcement learning occurs when points are won and lost—this is particularly important for strategic aspects of play such as shot placement and positioning (e.g., in 60% of the points where I hit a lob in response to a cross-court shot, I end up losing the point).\nIn the early stages, reinforcement also occurs when a shot succeeds in clearing the net and landing in the opponent’s court. Achieving this small success is itself a sequential process involving many motor control commands, and there is no teacher available to tell the learner’s motor cortex which motor control commands to issue."

Main principles3 stipulate “honesty and integrity” in all stages of scientific conduct (Recker 2021).2 Acceptable versus unacceptable behavior can sometimes be hard to distinguish and ethical principles can be in conflict with one another.3 In general, ethical behavior describes a set of actions that abide by certain rules of: Responsibility (accepting the potential costs, duties, and obligations of one’s decisions); Accountability (being answerable to others for decisions made and actions taken); Liability (accepting responsibility and accountability so individuals can recover damages done to them through breaches of responsibility); Due diligence (investigating or exercising care to ensure individuals can examine or appeal how responsibility, accountability, and liability are applied)\n\nMany professions and communities have formalized ethical codes to guide professionals in their field\n\nThe Hippocratic Oath: doctors should „do no harm“ to their patients.\nProfessional engineers code of ethics: „hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.”\nFirst law of robotics: “A robot may not injure a human being.”\n\n\nHere, we focus on one subset of ethical issues in scientific conduct—the reporting of research.\nFollowing Recker (2021), we discuss four ethical considerations that relate to scientific writing: plagiarism, recognition of co-author contributions, honest reporting, and the appropriate use of language."

They should give credit where credit is due but not where it is not due.\n\n\n\nPublic responsibility\n\nScientists should report research in the public media when the research has an important and direct bearing on human happiness and when the research has been sufficiently validated by scientific peers."

Hier fallen während des Lebenszyklus die höchsten Systemkosten an.\nEinführung: Wird eine freiwillige Nutzung unterstellt, ist diese im Idealfall zunehmend.

Alle Funktionen der Anwendung können produktiv genutzt werden. Es kommt idealerweise zu einem weiteren Anstieg der Nutzung, sofern es sich nicht um eine Anwendung mit beschränktem Benutzerkreis handelt.\nSättigung/Reife: In dieser Phase erreicht die Nutzung ihren Höhepunkt. Bisherige Nutzer können keine weiteren Nutzungsmöglichkeiten entdecken und weitere Nutzer kommen nicht mehr hinzu. Ein Nutzungsrückgang kann dadurch verursacht werden, dass das System nicht mehr dem Stand der Technik entspricht, mit anderen, zeitlich nachgelagert eingeführten, Systemen konkurriert oder die Menge und Bedeutung der unterstützten Aufgaben zurückgeht.\nRückgang: Der in der Phase Sättigung/Reife einsetzende Nutzungsrückgang setzt sich fort.\nAbschaffung: In dieser Phase wird die Entscheidung getroffen, zu welchem Zeitpunkt ein System abgeschafft oder durch ein neues System abgelöst wird. Über den Zeitpunkt der Nutzung hinaus kann das auslaufende System noch Umstellungskosten oder auch remanente Lizenzkosten verursachen."

How will individual employees and outcomes be evaluated? Will failure harm motivation and self-efficacy?\nProvide skills and training to enable employees to reach goals. Avoid harsh punishment for failure to reach a goal.\n\n\nWho sets the goals?\nPeople will become more committed to goals they help to set. At the same time, people may be tempted to set easy-to-reach goals.\nAllow transparency in the goal-setting process and involve more than one person or unit.\n\n\nIs the time horizon appropriate?\nShort-term goals may harm long-term performance.\nBe sure that short-term efforts to reach a goal do not harm investment in long-term outcomes.\n\n\nHow might goals influence risk taking?\nUnmet goals may induce risk taking.\nBe sure to articulate acceptable levels of risk.\n\n\nHow might goals motivate unethical behavior?\nGoals narrow focus. Employees with goals are less likely to recognize ethical issues, and more likely to rationalize their unethical behavior.\nMultiple safeguards may be necessary to ensure ethical behavior while attaining goals (e.g., leaders as exemplars of ethical behavior, making the costs of cheating far greater than the benefit, strong oversight).\n\n\nCan goals be idiosyncratically tailored for individual abilities and circumstances while preserving fairness?\nIndividual differences may make standardized goals inappropriate, yet unequal goals may be unfair.\nIf possible, strive to set goals that use common standards and account for individual variation.\n\n\nHow will goals influence organizational culture?\nIndividual goals may harm cooperation and corrode organizational culture.\nIf cooperation is essential, consider setting team-based rather than individual goals.Think carefully about the values that the specific, challenging goals convey.\n\n\nAre individuals intrinsically motivated?\nGoal setting can harm intrinsic motivation.\nAssess intrinsic motivation and avoid setting goals when intrinsic motivation is high.\n\n\nWhat type of goal (performance or learning) is most appropriate given the ultimate objectives of the organization?\nBy focusing on performance goals, employees may fail to search for better strategies and fail to learn.\nIn complex, changing environments, learning goals may be more effective than performance goals."

    "text": "How we deal with our inner worlds does drive everything. Susan David, Psychologist\n\n\nIn our modern societies, we attribute a lot to externalities. Often we think that we can change anything by changing externalities (e.g., changing our look to become more self-confident). And the external world does matter. Just think of what we discussed during the last lectures (e.g., “shaping the path”). But ultimately, the way we navigate our inner world, our ability to be healthy with ourselves, with our emotions, to be connected with our values and who we want to be, this has an outsize impact on everything else.\nThis class is about emotional agility, the ability to come to your inner world—your thoughts, emotions, experiences and self-stories—with courage, compassion and curiosity. We try to find answers to the questions why and how we should learn from them, evaluate the situations we face, be clear-sighted about your options and move forward with values and purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis unit is inspired by and based on the book Emotional Agility by S.

David 2016) …\n\n\ntake up huge amounts of mental energy,\nlead the thought or emotion to hang around for longer,\ndecrease our ability to solve problems,\nnegatively impact our relationships, and,\nlead to lower levels of well-being over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood news about bad moods\n\n\n\nWhile it is rarely fun to be in a bad mood, and it is certainly not healthy to constantly stew in ‘negative’ emotions, here some examples of what experiences of sadness, anger, guilt, or fear can do:\n\nHelp us form arguments\nImprove memory\nEncourage perseverance\nMake us more polite and attentive\nEncourage generosity\nMake us less prone to confirmation bias"

It’s the idea that you can feel angry with your partner, notice that anger with compassion, and still reach out and give them a hug, because you recognize how much you value the relationship. There is wisdom in bothness. We can be afraid and still engage with a challenge. We can grieve and still laugh at a joke. Bothness gives us access to the full spectrum of life.

S. David (2016)\n\nIf you’re ‘emotionally rigid’, you’re blind to new experiences and possibilities. You’ll find yourself stuck on the same path, even though it has made you unhappy for years. Picture a Naval officer demanding a lighthouse change course without realizing it wasn’t a ship [*S. David (2016), p. 1]. The belief was that his vessel had right of way but such rigid thinking could have led to catastrophe! Adopting agility in your emotions is more likely to steer you on the right path and allow you to be flexible when you need to be.\nEmotional agility is needed as the world is constantly changing and, thus, always presenting us with new opportunities and situations to which conditions or pre-programmed cognitive and emotional responses are not helpful. We should, thus, always embrace a beginners mind."

    "text": "Getting unhooked\n\n\n\nFigure 2: David’s (2016) framework for increasing emotional agility\n\n\n\n\nShow up\nThe first step is acknowledging emotions and stresses as they occur – not to dwell on them, but to learn. What am I feeling right now? What does this say about my values? An emotionally agile person is able to recognize their feelings with self-compassion and understanding.\nBeing more self-compassionate includes:\n\nletting go of self-criticism and expectations of perfection (within yourself, your work, your life at home);\nrecognizing that comparing yourself with others is, almost always, a losing game;\nunderstanding that self-compassion does not make you weak or lazy. In fact, research shows the opposite - that self-compassion sharpens your edge;\nappreciating that self-compassion is not about lying to yourself. People who are self-compassionate are more likely to face into the truth about themselves and their weaknesses, than those who lack self-compassion.\n\n\n\nStepping out\nStepping out means facing and labeling the problem. You need to take an objective view and assess your emotions. This can help you filter feelings that may not be entirely appropriate and to find ways to deal with what you are feeling.\nWhen you step out objectively, you are in control of your feelings and not the other way around.\nSkills you can cultivate:\n\nThe ability for you, the thinker, rather than the thought to be in charge, and for you, the person, rather than your emotions to be in charge. In other words, developing the skill that allows you to be centered, reflective and intentional in your reactions to events around you.\nDeveloping a ‘meta view’ or the ability to still feel your feelings and think your thoughts but to ‘helicopter’ above these in order to make effective decisions.\nThe ability to recognize when you are holding on to specific positions and ideas in ways that may not serve your life, and to let go of these.\n\n\n\nWalking your why\n‘Walking your why’ means discovering what is important to you and acting accordingly. When you walk your why, you live by your personal values as closely as you possibly can. Living by your values will help to make your life more meaningful and satisfying.\nWhile it is not always possible to work or live the exact life you wish, there is usually a way to make your life or job fit better within your values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome characteristics of values (S. David 2016)\n\n\n\nValues\n\nare freely chosen; have not been imposed on you;\nare not goals; they are ongoing rather than fixed;\nguide you rather then constrain you;\nare active not static;\nallow you to get closer to the way you want to life your life;\nbring you freedom from social comparison;\nfoster self-acceptance, which is crucial for mental health.\n\n\n\nWhen we move towards our values and are able to make choices that align us with who we want to be, that is incredibly empowering, and provides a new found sense of autonomy in difficult situations.\nTo make a difference in this area it may help you to:\n\nWatch the gaps: Simply noticing the gaps between your values and your behaviors in specific domains (at work, home, in your relationships or as they relate to your health and wellbeing) can help you to close them.\nThink first: “is my response in line with my values of Accountability, Straightforwardness and Challenge?”\nRemember that values are not abstract and intangible ideas. Rather they are qualities of action that you can bring to every day choices.\n\n\n\nMove on\nOnce you’ve unpacked what you’re feeling, why you’re feeling that way, and aligned your next steps with who you want to be in the situation, it’s time to move on and take action.\nEmotionally agile individuals handle situations as they come up, feel them fully, make a plan, and don’t delay.\nThis requires some critical areas of focus:\n\nA change mindset: developing the belief that positive change is actually possible. Research shows that subtle differences in our beliefs about change can have a long-term impact across many different areas of our lives.\nEffective motivations: trying to make a change based on a ‘have-to’ motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a sense of obligation to your doctor, spouse, or due to shame) is less likely to be effective than a change based on a ‘want-to’ motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a genuine, internal desire to be healthier.) The type of motivation we have is critically important in determining whether a change will be successful.\nHabit tweaks: understanding how to master the physics of successful habit change.\nMoving to discomfort: making the choice to push oneself towards the edge of one’s comfort zone as one tries to develop skills and cultivate relationships."

    "text": "Read-interpret-write\nWhen consuming scientific literature, it’s not always necessary or efficient to read every sentence from start to finish.\nYou can apply the read-interpret-write strategy to keep focused and make the most of your reading (adapted from read-think-interpret strategy in Recker 2021).\n\n\nRead — before diving into the details, skim the title, abstract, introduction, headings, subheadings, and conclusion; then identify key sections that contribute to your objectives and read those piece by piece\nInterpret — think about the piece’s relevance for your research and evaluate whether there are useful ideas, theories, concept, methods, or findings you should investigate in more depth\nWrite — Keep a (digital) notebook where you note down key takeaways, questions, and reflections.\n\n\nWhile reading, interpreting and writing, always keep your research goals in mind.\n\nThe following questions can guide you in the read-interpret-write process (Recker 2021):\n\nWhat is the central contribution of the material in terms of contemporary practice in your field of research?\nHow does it relate to other articles and practices?\nDoes the reading represent a theoretical or methodological perspective that might be useful in examining the phenomena that interest you? And why is this the case, or why not?\nHow might it inform your own thinking about the field?\nHow do you think the reading influenced the state of knowledge in the field at the time it was published?\n\nAdditional strategies\n\nUse highlighting or annotation: As you read, use highlighting, underlining, or digital annotation tools to mark key points, important concepts, and relevant citations. This can help you quickly locate and review important information later. Read Strategically: If you’re reading a longer paper, consider reading strategically by reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph. This can give you a sense of the main ideas without getting bogged down in every detail.\nFollow citations: If a paper references other works that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related resrks that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related research.\nTake breaks: Reading complex material for extended periods can lead to reduced comprehension. Take short breaks to maintain focus and prevent fatigue.\nUtilize summaries: In addition to reading full papers, consider using summaries, reviews, or annotated bibliographies to get an overview of key concepts and findings before deciding whether to delve into the complete paper."

Possible criteria are\n\nContent (topics or variables) has bearing to the research question\nPublication language can be read by the team\nLimitation to a select set of high-quality journals/conferences\nThe review might consider only those studies conducted in certain settings\nRestriction to works that study subjects of a certain gender, work situation\nFocus on studies in certain date ranges\n\n\n\nSearching for literature\nIt is most efficient to use open access databases (such as Google Scholar and the Directory of Open Access Journals) and specific subject databases (such as ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCO, IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library) to search for literature.\nSearch queries that reflect the defined search and inclusion criteria need to be defined.\nThe search should be supplemented further by backward and forward search.\n\n\nExtracting data\nSystematic information extraction from each paper to elicit the raw material for the synthesis step. The type of data to extract is based on the research question established during the protocol phase.\nQualitative coding techniques and related software packages can be used to extract data (e.g., MaxQDA or NVivo)\nRecommendation: Video tutorial „Using MAXQDA for a literature review“\nFurther reads: Fink (2019) and Keele et al.

The first step was then to find out everything about it: what it looks like, what it does, what its genetic structure is, where it occurs, who can be infected by it, and so forth.\n\nType 2\n\n“How” and “why” questions are explanatory as they seek to answer questions about the causal mechanisms that are at work in a particular phenomenon. Example: We wanted to find out how the Covid-19 virus infects people so we could devise treatments and vaccinations that hinder the mechanism by which the virus infects people.\n\n\nType 2 questions often temporally succeed type 1 questions as it is difficult to explain a phenomenon without first systematically exploring and describing it."

    "text": "Quality-checks\nThe research question help you focus the study and give you guidance for how to conduct it.\nRecker (2021) proposes following principles to reflect on if a RQ serves these functions well.\n\n\nShort: Research questions have to be concise (rule of thumb: one line of text, max. 1.5 lines).\nFeasible: You should have answers to at least following questions: Are you able to observe all concepts you use in the research question? Are adequate subjects of study available? How will you collect the data? How will you analyze the data? Do you have the technical expertise, the time and money?\nInteresting: You are confident that you can maintain an interest in the topic and maintain your own motivation to study it.\nNovel: An answer will confirm or refute previous findings or provide new findings.\nEthical: Pursuing and answering the question will not violate ethical principles for the conduct of research, and will not put the safety of the investigators or subjects at risk.\nRelevant: Both the question and the future answer(s) are important in the sense that they inform scientific knowledge, industry practice, and future research directions.\n\n\n\nIn addition, consider the following checks:\n\nResearch questions have to be formulated in a way that they cannot be answered by Yes or No or similar binary results.\nResearch can not directly answer practical questions such as “How can I improve X?” To address such practical questions, you need to focus on what you don’t understand about the phenomena you are studying, and investigate what is really going on with these phenomena.\nResearch questions should not ask for potentially infinite lists of factors such as “What factors influence…”. Such questions are too vague and thus do not provide the focus needed.\nDo not pack several questions into one sentence. Typical sign for several questions within one sentence are connections with “and” or “or”. Each question has to be presented in a separate sentence and has to be formulated as explicit question with question mark at the end of the sentence.\nResearch questions often relate one or more variables to one another and ask for relationships. In the following “y” means the dependent variable (the variable to be explained, improved, influenced,..) and “x” the independent variables (= the variable that are assumed to exert an influence on y). Research questions often look like this: „How is x related to y? What is the role of x for y? Why does x influence y? To which extent does x influence y?\n\nThe expression “To which extent” when used in research questions needs statistical evaluations and measurement in numbers. They typically cannot be answered by qualitative research.\nFor empirical work, the research question needs at least two precisely formulated variables. Checkpoints: Does the question contain at least two variables that are formulated in a way that you can imagine that they can be measured? What could be the source of data? Is there access to the data?\nVariables should not express an activity or process because that would require a longitudinal study (= study over time with several measurement periods). This typically exceeds the timeframe of a master’s thesis."
