If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we’re likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort.\n\n\nWhat prevents discomfort can be addictive, but that doesn’t make it irresistible.

    "section": "Pain management",
    "text": "Pain management\nGearing towards traction is pain management. Distractions cost us time, and like all actions, they are spurred by the desire to escape discomfort.\n\nFour psychological factors make satisfaction temporary. Our tendencies toward boredom, negativity bias, rumination, and hedonic adaptation conspire to make sure we’re never satisfied for long.\n\n\n\n\nBoredom: It’s shocking how far people will go to avoid boredom. For instance, Wilson et al. (2014) found that participants typically did not enjoy spending 6 to 15 minutes in a room by themselves with nothing to do but think, that they enjoyed doing mundane external activities much more, and that many preferred to administer electric shocks to themselves instead of being left alone with their thoughts. Most people seem to prefer to be doing something rather than nothing, even if that something is negative.\nNegativity bias is a phenomenon in which negative events are more salient and demand attention more powerfully than neutral or positive events” (Chai et al. 2016, 2). There is ample empirical evidence that adults display a negativity bias, or the propensity to attend to, learn from, and use negative information far more than positive information (Vaish, Grossmann, and Woodward 2008). Such pessimism seems to begin very early in life. Vaish, Grossmann, and Woodward (2008) show that even babies as young as seven months show signs of negative bias. In a nutshell: bad ist stronger than good.\nRumination includes reflection and brooding. Reflection refers to ‘a purposeful turning inward to engage in cognitive problem solving’, while brooding reflects ‘a passive comparison of one’s current situation with some unachieved standard’ (Treynor, Gonzalez, and Nolen-Hoeksema 2003, 256). Put it simple, rumination is the tendency to keep thinking about bad experiences. Though rumination is a useful trait to discover sources of error or alternative strategies, it can make us miserable.\nHedonic adaptation: We have the tendency to return quickly to a baseline levle of satisfaction no matter what happens to as in life (Eyal 2019, 32). This leads to all kinds of life events that we think would make us happier not lasting very long.\n\n\nFeeling bad isn’t actually bad; it’s exactly what survival of the fittest intended. It is an innate power that can be channeled to help us make things better.\n\n\n\nIf we want to master distraction,\nwe must learn to deal with discomfort. Eyal (2019, 33)"

When you are tempted to distraction, tell yourself that it’s fine to give in, but not right now, just wait ten minutes. This rule allows time to do what some behavioral psychologist call ‘urge surfing’. This accepting attitude allows an urge to grow and recede without taking action (to reduce negative affect or increase positive affect), when it takes hold (Ostafin and Marlatt 2008)."

It’s breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover its hiden beauty. Eyal (2019, 48)\n\n\n\n\nImplications\nLook for challenges in (tedious) tasks—deliberateness and novelty can be added to any task to make it fun.\n\nI try to make gardening more fun by soakcing up as much information as I can about the way grass (and weed) grows and how to treat it. I find it challenging to deal with the constraints I have (weather, tools, weed), be it fighting the weed or beating my record time in cutting grass.

    "section": "Reimagine your temperament",
    "text": "Reimagine your temperament\nWe don’t run out of willpower. Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.\n\nMany studies offer evidence for a phenomenon called ego depletion—the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up (Baumeister and Tierney 2012). Some researchers also concluded that self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source (i.e., the fuel in our willpower tank). However, only recently Job et al. (2013) concluded that only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. People how did not see willpower as a finite resource did not show signs of ego depletion.\nThere is also the viewpoint that willpower is not a finite resource, but acts like an emotion. Just as we don’t “run dry” of joy or anger, willpower fluctuates depending on what is happening to us and how we are feeling. Eyal (2019, 51) does concludes that “if mental engery is more like an emotion than fuel in a tank, it can be managed and utilized as such”.\n\n\nWhat we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control (e.g., the cravings are stronger then my willpower) actually leads to less self-control.\n\n\n\nImplications\nBelief in your willpower and practice self-compassion, because people how do not see their willpower as limited resource and are more self-compassionate are more resilient."

Eyal (2019, 70)\n\n\n\n\nImplications\n\n\nTimebox your day2. Plan time to live your values; plan time not only for work, but also for you (e.g., distraction) and your relationships.\nReflect and refine. Revisit and refine your schedule regularly, but stick to it once it’s set(Gollwitzer 1999).\n\n\n\nEyal (2019, 63–64) recommends to set aside fifteen minutes a week to revisit and refine your calendar by asking following questions:\n\nWhen in my schedule did I do what I said I would do and when did I get distracted?\nWhat strategies can I use to manage the trigger next time?\nAre there changes I can make to my calendar that will give me the time I need to better express my values?\n\nEyal (2019, 64) also advises creating a schedule as a curious scientist rather than a drill sergant. This gives the freedom to get better with each iteration."

Use the meeting for consensus not for problem-solving, be fully present and leave devices outside except for one laptop.\nApps: Use distracting apps on your desktop rather than on your phone.

Pleasure means ‘not profligate pleasures, but absence of bodily pain and mental tarachai or troubles’ (Greek philosopher Epicurus according to Annas 1987, 3)\n\n\nAll motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we’re likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort.\n\n\nWhat prevents discomfort can be addictive, but that doesn’t make it irresistible.

    "text": "Pain management\nGearing towards traction is pain management. Distractions cost us time, and like all actions, they are spurred by the desire to escape discomfort.\n\nFour psychological factors make satisfaction temporary. Our tendencies toward boredom, negativity bias, rumination, and hedonic adaptation conspire to make sure we’re never satisfied for long.\n\n\n\n\nBoredom: It’s shocking how far people will go to avoid boredom. For instance, Wilson et al. (2014) found that participants typically did not enjoy spending 6 to 15 minutes in a room by themselves with nothing to do but think, that they enjoyed doing mundane external activities much more, and that many preferred to administer electric shocks to themselves instead of being left alone with their thoughts. Most people seem to prefer to be doing something rather than nothing, even if that something is negative.\nNegativity bias is a phenomenon in which negative events are more salient and demand attention more powerfully than neutral or positive events” (Chai et al. 2016, 2). There is ample empirical evidence that adults display a negativity bias, or the propensity to attend to, learn from, and use negative information far more than positive information (Vaish, Grossmann, and Woodward 2008). Such pessimism seems to begin very early in life. Vaish, Grossmann, and Woodward (2008) show that even babies as young as seven months show signs of negative bias. In a nutshell: bad ist stronger than good.\nRumination includes reflection and brooding. Reflection refers to ‘a purposeful turning inward to engage in cognitive problem solving’, while brooding reflects ‘a passive comparison of one’s current situation with some unachieved standard’ (Treynor, Gonzalez, and Nolen-Hoeksema 2003, 256). Put it simple, rumination is the tendency to keep thinking about bad experiences. Though rumination is a useful trait to discover sources of error or alternative strategies, it can make us miserable.\nHedonic adaptation: We have the tendency to return quickly to a baseline levle of satisfaction no matter what happens to as in life (Eyal 2019, 32). This leads to all kinds of life events that we think would make us happier not lasting very long.\n\n\nFeeling bad isn’t actually bad; it’s exactly what survival of the fittest intended. It is an innate power that can be channeled to help us make things better.\n\n\n\nIf we want to master distraction,\nwe must learn to deal with discomfort. Eyal (2019, 33)"

When you are tempted to distraction, tell yourself that it’s fine to give in, but not right now, just wait ten minutes. This rule allows time to do what some behavioral psychologist call ‘urge surfing’. This accepting attitude allows an urge to grow and recede without taking action (to reduce negative affect or increase positive affect), when it takes hold (Ostafin and Marlatt 2008)."

    "text": "Reimagine your temperament\nWe don’t run out of willpower. Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.\n\nMany studies offer evidence for a phenomenon called ego depletion—the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up (Baumeister and Tierney 2012). Some researchers also concluded that self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source (i.e., the fuel in our willpower tank). However, only recently Job et al. (2013) concluded that only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. People how did not see willpower as a finite resource did not show signs of ego depletion.\nThere is also the viewpoint that willpower is not a finite resource, but acts like an emotion. Just as we don’t “run dry” of joy or anger, willpower fluctuates depending on what is happening to us and how we are feeling. Eyal (2019, 51) does concludes that “if mental engery is more like an emotion than fuel in a tank, it can be managed and utilized as such”.\n\n\nWhat we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control (e.g., the cravings are stronger then my willpower) actually leads to less self-control.\n\n\nImplications\nBelief in your willpower and practice self-compassion, because people how do not see their willpower as limited resource and are more self-compassionate are more resilient."

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nExample: Jerry Sternin and mothers in Vietnam\nIn 1990, Jerry Sternin was working for Save the Children, asked to open a new office in Vietnam “to make a difference” within 6 months (see e.g., Marsh et al. 2004)\n\n\nMany children suffered malnutrition—a result of many intertwined problems: poor sanitation, universal poverty, no clean water, etc. (true but useless analysis)\nSternin synthesized the “conventional wisdom” about feeding kids (norms)\nSternin looked for very poor kids who are bigger and healthier than the typical child and analyzed what the mothers were doing differently (posivite deviations)\nSternin organized cooking groups where the mothers got highly specific instructions (Rider) and the feeling that they can make their kids healthier (Elephant), which also changed the culture of the village (path)\nSix months later, 65 percent of the kids were better nourished and stayed that way; years later the program reached 2.2 million Vietnamese people\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nSwitch from a problem focus to a solution focus.\nAsk the exception question—when does the problem you’re fighting not happen?\n\n\nGather data on the issue\nStudy the data to find the bright spots5 (the positive deviants)\nMake sure you understand the “normal way” things are done\nStudy the bright spots to see what they’re doing differently\nMake sure none of those practices are “exceptional” in some way\nFind a way to reproduce the practices of the bright spots among other people"

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nExample: Brazilien southern line\nIn 1996, GP Investimentor Limited bought parts of the Brazilian railway network (a deteriorating mess) and set a young talent in charge—Alexandre Behring.\n\n\nBehring only had 30 million Brazilian reals in cash on its balance sheet (i.e., nothing)\nTo change direction and guide decision-making, Behring developed four rules:\n\nMoney is only invested in projects that provide higher revenue in the short term\nThe best solution to a problem is the one that costs the least money up front\nQuick fixes are preferred to slower options that provide superior long-term fixes\nReusing or recycling existing materials is better than acquiring new materials\n\nIn 2000, the companies performance improved from a net loss of 80 million reals to a net profit of 24 million reals\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nChange brings new choices that create uncertainty, which fatigues/paralyses the Rider and frightens the Elephant (the paradox of choice6)\nIf you want to change things, be clear about how people should act:\n\n\nRemove ambiguity from the vision\nTransform aspiration (the change idea) into action (specific behavior)\nGet rid of any abstraction\nGive priority to critical moves that evoke more parts of the framework\n\n\n\n\nClarity resolves resistance. Heath and Heath (2011, 72)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecklist: Do you have the right “critical moves”?\n\n\n\n\nDoes it evoke emotion? (Find the feeling)\nDoes it feel do-able? (Shrink the change)\nWas it a part of success stories in the past? **(Find the bright spots)*\nWill your team see the connection with the big picture?

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nExample: No dry holes at BP\nAfter a decades of success, in the 90s, BP had issues to find untapped oil resources.\n\n\nIn 1989, BP had an average accuracy rate of just 1 out of 5 (global standard)\nThe oil explorers behaved like salesmen and put pressure to drill every well (the logic behind: the payoff on hitting one big well will cover for the ones they did not hit)\nTo reduce cost per Barrel, the CEO posed a clear destination: “No Dry Holes”—meaning no random shots, but systematic tests (using the knowledge they had)\nBut No Dry Holes created an even bigger shift in BP’s culture—no one rationalized failure buy saying ‘Oh, we hit a dry well, but we learned’\nIn 2020, BP’s hit rate was 2 out of 3\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nPaint a rich, detailed picture of what the destination looks like that is concrete and motivational (i.e., the destination postcard)\n\n\nAvoid metrics as destinations (SMART goals are fine, but they should also be inspiring enough to motivate the Elephant)\nReduce uncertainty and, thus, opportunities for rationalization7\nConsider moving from process (e.g., 100% handwashing compliance) to outcome (e.g., 0% hospital-acquired infection)\nIf “backsliding” is a problem, consider a black and white goal (i.e., a goal that brooks no dissent)8\nBack up the destination postcard with a good behavioral script—describe the moves for a jump start"

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nExample: Chemotherapy game\nAfter enduring weeks of brutal chemotherapy in the hospital, the children struggled to faithfully take their medications at home.\n\n\nIf you skip 20 percent of your doses, you don’t have a 20 percent higher chance of getting cancer again. Your odds go up 200 percent. Steve Cole, research director for HopeLabs\n\n\n\nHope labs developed a game called Re-Mission (Kato et al. 2008)\n\n\nThey played Roxxi, a nanorobot in a silver suit that moved through the bloodstream and bombarded tumor cells with electro-green chemo beams; in between, Smitty, a mentor robot, provided additional information about chemotherapy and recovery\nKids adherence to their medication plans increased significantly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nMake the need for change visual\nThings you see are more likely to evoke emotion than things you read\n\nBe cautious with negative emotions when people need to think flexibly or creatively\nNegative emotions are effective to motivate people to tackle short-run challenges that require clear, forceful action\n\n\nInspire positive emotion, e.g., by pointing to a bright spot\nPositive emotions broaden and build our repertoire of thoughts and action and encourage us to play\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera crew thought experiment.\n\n\n\nImagine that, in making the case for change to your people, you weren’t allowed to speak to them directly. Instead, you had a camera crew at your disposal who would film anything you wanted them to film, and you could pick any 10 minutes of footage that they shot. What would be happening in that footage?"

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nExample: Wass loyalty card\nA local car wash ran a promotion featuring loyalty cards (Nunes and Dreze 2006)\n\nGroup A: For every car wash bought, customers got a stamp on their card - eight stamps meant a free car wash\nGroup B: Customers needed to collect ten stam, but they were given a “head start” (2 stamps have already been added)\nAfter a few months, only 19 percent of group A had earned a free wash vs. 34 percent of group B\n\n\nPeople find it motivating to be partly finished with a longer story then to be at the starting gate of a shorter one Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nThe endowed progress effect is the idea that if you provide some type of artificial advancement toward a goal, a person will be more motivated to complete the goal (Nunes and Dreze 2006).\n\n\nThe elephant is easily demoralized. Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nShow progress, plan for small wins (i.e., immediate, meaningful payoffs)\nSet goals within reach, don’t let success feel to distant\nCare for a boost of hope that change is possible\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall targets lead to small victories, small victories can trigger momentum.

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nIdentities are central to the way people make decision (March 2009).\n\n\nAny change measure that violates a person’s identity easily fails (i.e., identity threat).\nAspire people to be the kind of person who would make the change (i.e., engage in identity work).\nChanging identities is a quest, an every quest involves failure. Because the Elephant hates failure, you should create the expectation of failure.\n\n\n\nA growth mindset helps to grow (Dweck 2017).\n\n\nIt frames failure as a natural part of the change process (not of the situation) and\nA growth mindest helps to establish confidence that the Elephant is capable of conquering the change (he feels “big” relative to the challenge)"

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nExample: Medication at Kaiser South\nAt Kaiser South Sans Francisco Hospital, nurses administer about eight hundred medications a day.\n\n\nNurses have an impressive accuracy record: on average, they commit approx. 1 error per 1,000 medications administered\nHowever, a single error can be harmful or even deadly\nIn an effort to reduce medication errors, distraction was identified as a cause\nDistraction isn’t a Rider (understanding) nor an Elephant problem (motivation)\nInstead of changing nurses behavior, medication vests have been installed, showing that nurses are administering drugs and should be left alone\nErrors dropped 47 percent\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nSocial psychology shows that often situations trump personal attributes.\n\nHowever, people have a systematic tendency to ignore the situation forces that shape other peoples behavior—the fundamental attribution error.\n\n\nAvoid the fundamental attribution error\nEmphasize thee “tweak” (focus on small changes)\nInvestigate your environment quickly (What one thing can you shift to make the right behaviors more likely?)\nTry to rearrange the environment to remove the obstacles, provide signposts that show people which way to turn, eliminate steps (1-click …)"

If you often forget to take your vitamins in the morning, put the vitamin bottle on top of the toothpaste. You know you’ll remember to brush your teeth, so you can “piggyback” your vitamin intake with brushing your teeth.

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nConclusions\nBe smart about social pressure.\nIf the majority of people on your team are already following the new plan, then publicize that fact, social pressure will influence the others to conform.\n\nDesign a free space.\nSometimes it is helpful to create small-scale settings within a community that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated in, and generate the cultural challenge that precedes mobilization. (Polletta 1999).\n\n\nIf people embrace change, make sure their actions are visible.\nFight resistance echo chambers by showcasing people who are actively supporting the change. Shine a spotlight on the early signs of success."
