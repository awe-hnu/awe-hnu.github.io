This standard model prevails not only in AI, ‚Äúbut also in control theory, where a controller minimizes a cost function; in operations research, where a policy maximizes a sum of rewards; in statistics, where a decision rule minimizes a loss function; and in economics, where a decision maker maximizes utility or some measure of social welfare‚Äù (p.¬†22).\nThey also criticize the standard model because it is increasingly difficult to specify the goal completely and correctly (e.g., autonomous driving involves multiple goals such as reaching the goal safely, where a strict definition of safety requires staying in the garage because driving on the road has a risk of injury due to myriad factors; how should the trade-off between reaching the goal and taking a risk of injury be made? There are so many questions that are difficult to answer a priori). Mis-specified goals most likely do not reflect what human designers intend, e.g., by not taking into account human values that are not included in the goals."

This standard model prevails not only in AI, ‚Äúbut also in control theory, where a controller minimizes a cost function; in operations research, where a policy maximizes a sum of rewards; in statistics, where a decision rule minimizes a loss function; and in economics, where a decision maker maximizes utility or some measure of social welfare‚Äù (p.¬†22).\nThey also criticize the standard model because it is increasingly difficult to specify the goal completely and correctly (e.g., autonomous driving involves multiple goals such as reaching the goal safely, where a strict definition of safety requires staying in the garage because driving on the road has a risk of injury due to myriad factors; how should the trade-off between reaching the goal and taking a risk of injury be made? There are so many questions that are difficult to answer a priori). Mis-specified goals most likely do not reflect what human designers intend, e.g., by not taking into account human values that are not included in the goals."

It chooses the action that leads to the best expected utility, where expected utility is computed by averaging over all possible states, weighted by the probability of the outcome (Russel and Norvig 2022, 73).\nThe utility function is essentially an internalization of the performance measure.\nA utility-based agent has many advantages in terms of flexibility and learning, which are particularly helpful in environments characterized by partial observability and nondeterminism.\nIn addition, there are cases where the goals are insufficient but a utility-based agent can still make rational decisions based on the probabilities and the utilities of the outcomes:\n\nWhen there are conflicting goals, the utility function specifies the appropriate tradeoff.\nLikelihood of success (i.e., goal achievement) can be weighed against the importance of the goals\n\nMode- and utility-based agents are difficult to implement. They need to model and keep track of the task environment, which requires ingenious sensors, sophisticated algorithms, and a high computational complexity.\nThere are also utility-based agents that are not model-based. These agents just learn what action is best in a particular situation without any ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù of its impact on the environment (e.g., based on reinforcement learning)."

The vacuum agent perceives which square it is in and whether there is dirt in the square. The agent starts in square A. The available actions are to move to the right, move to the left, suck up the dirt, or do nothing. One very simple agent function is the following: if the current square is dirty, then suck; otherwise, move to the other square.\n\n\n\nAccording to Russel and Norvig (2022, 56), all areas of engineering can be seen as designing artifacts that interact with the world. AI operates at the most interesting end to the spectrum, where the artifacts have significant computational resources and the task environment requires nontrivial decision making."

    "text": "Top\nSlides\n\n\nGeneral remarks\nThis course will be taught using traditional synchronous lectures. The focus of the live sessions is on discussing real world cases and developing theoretically-based explanations. In addition, you will do an original research on a digital innovation case on your own (see assignment).\nIt is of really important that you prepare yourself for every session. You either need to work through teaching materials in advance or prepare to present the deliverables of your own case (see Table¬†1).\n\n\nContents\nThis course offers you the possibility to learn about industry-specific challenges and how this influences the way of organizing, managing and communicating digital innovations, in particular:\n\n\nSpecifics of industries (context, products, markets, obstacles, enablers)\nIndustry-specific applicability and adaptations of innovation strategies\nMethods for discovering need finding, ideation and prototyping of digital innovations\nCase studies of digital innovation in industries\nTheories that explain the mechanisms of digital innovations\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nDuring this course, you should advance your skills in the following areas:\n\n\nEnhanced knowledge of various industries and their special characteristics\nUnderstanding of specifics of managing digital innovations in these industries\nKnowledge of theoretical models that help to explain and manage these innovations\nAbility to analyze specificities and complexities of different industries\nCapacity to adapt digital innovation management methods and tools accordingly\nAbility to clearly communicate conclusions and the underlying rationale\nAbility to evaluate new information and to question existing assumptions\nExpertise to develop independent contributions to practical and theoretical discourse\n\n\n\n\nEffort\nYou will gain 5 ECTS for this course. This equals approx. 150 hours workload, of which you need most to pass the course.\n\n\nLive sessions (approx. 40 hours)\nPreparation of the live sessions (approx. 20 hours)\nCase research and writing (approx. 90 hours)\n\n\n\nPlease prepare your schedule accordingly.\n\n\n\nGrading\nThe grade is based on the evaluation of the written case study (see assignment).\nThe presentations are mandatory but will not be graded individually.\n\n\nSchedule\n\nIt is of importance that you prepare yourself for the sessions and work on the case study continually.
