The typology reaffirms that distinct, consistent, and recurring patterns of strategic behavior exist.\n\nConsumer goods\n\nHarvest\n\nOrganizations following a harvest strategy often prioritize maximizing short-term financial returns. They may reduce investments in growth and innovation. Characteristics: Emphasis on cost reduction, efficiency, and capitalizing on existing assets and market positions.\n\nBuilder\n\nOrganizations that actively seek growth opportunities and invest in expanding their market presence within consumer goods. Characteristics: Willingness to take risks, invest in R&D and new ventures, and pursue aggressive growth strategies.\n\nContinuity\n\nOrganizations that aim to maintain stability and continuity by avoiding major changes or risks within consumer goods. Characteristics: Preference for maintaining existing operations, market positions, and core business practices.\n\nClimber\n\nOrganizations that aggressively pursue growth and expansion, often at a rapid pace. Characteristics: High-risk tolerance, willingness to enter new markets, and pursue growth opportunities aggressively.\n\nNiche\n\nOrganizations that specialize in serving a narrow market segment or niche within consumer goods. Characteristics: Deep understanding of niche markets, customized products/services, and a focus on meeting specialized customer needs.\n\nCashout\n\nOrganizations that generate significant cash flows from established business units but may not actively seek growth. Characteristics: Emphasis on cash generation and profitability from mature products or services.\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial products\n\nLow commitment:\n\nLow commitment organizations maintain a minimal commitment to any particular strategy and may lack a clear strategic direction.

These strategies are based on the scope of the target market and the competitive advantage sought.\n\nStrategies\n\nCost leadership strategy\n\nThe cost leadership strategy centers on achieving the lowest production and delivery costs in an industry, enabling a company to offer products or services at competitive prices while maintaining profitability. Key elements include economies of scale, rigorous cost control, and pricing at or below industry averages. This strategy targets a broad market scope but comes with risks such as intense price competition and the potential need to sacrifice quality or innovation.\n\nDifferentiation strategy\n\nThe differentiation strategy focuses on creating unique and distinctive products or services that customers perceive as valuable and distinct from competitors. This uniqueness allows a company to command premium prices and build customer loyalty. It involves product innovation, effective branding and marketing, and a customer-centric approach. The target market is often broad, appealing to customers willing to pay more for differentiated offerings. However, sustaining differentiation requires ongoing investment and innovation.\n\nFocus strategy\n\nThe focus strategy involves concentrating efforts on serving a specific market segment, niche, or customer group exceptionally well. By tailoring products, services, or solutions to meet the distinct needs of this chosen market, a company can excel within a narrow scope. Key aspects include market segmentation, specialization, and relationship building within the targeted segment. While the focus strategy minimizes exposure to broader market risks, it also makes the company vulnerable to changes in the chosen market and potential competition from larger players.\n\n\n\n\nStuck in the middle\nBeing stuck in the middle refers to a situation where a company attempts to pursue multiple generic strategies simultaneously without excelling in any one of them. This term is often used to describe a lack of clear strategic focus or a failure to achieve a competitive advantage through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus.\nEffective strategic management often involves making deliberate choices about which generic strategy to pursue and aligning the organization’s resources and activities accordingly. When a company tries to pursue multiple strategies without excelling in any of them, it may struggle to compete effectively in its industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade-offs\n\n\n\nTrade-offs are necessary in order to secure a strategic position against activities that are incompatible. The essence of strategy is as much about choosing what not to do as choosing what to do (Mintzberg 2014).\nTrade-offs arise for three reasons: 1. To avoid inconsistencies in image or reputation. 2. Different positions require different product configurations, equipment, skills, management systems, etc. 3. Due to limits on internal coordination and control.\nPositioning trade-offs are essential to strategy – they create the need for choice, and purposefully limit what a company offers. They deter ‘straddling’ and ‘repositioning’ by competitors.\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines (David and David 2016)\n\nMPMDPDD\n\n\nMarket penetration:\n\nWhen current markets are not saturated with a particular product or service\nWhen the usage rate of present customers could be increased significantly\nWhen the market shares of major competitors have been declining while total industry sales have been increasing\nWhen the correlation between dollar sales and dollar marketing expenditures historically has been high\nWhen increased economies of scale provide major competitive advantages\n\n\n\nMarket development:\n\nWhen new channels of distribution are available that are reliable, inexpensive, and of good quality\nWhen an organization is very successful at what it does\nWhen new untapped or unsaturated markets exist\nWhen an organization has the needed capital and human resources to manage expanded operations\nWhen an organization has excess production capacity\nWhen an organization’s basic industry is rapidly becoming global in scope\n\n\n\nProduct development:\n\nWhen an organization has successful products that are in the maturity stage of the product life cycle\nWhen an organization competes in an industry characterized by rapid technological developments\nWhen major competitors offer better-quality products at comparable prices\nWhen an organization competes in a high-growth industry\nWhen an organization has strong research and development capabilities\n\n\n\nRelated diversification:\n\nWhen an organization competes in a no-growth or a slow-growth industry\nWhen adding new, but related, products would significantly enhance the sales of current products\nWhen new, but related, products could be offered at highly competitive prices\nWhen new, but related, products have seasonal sales levels that counterbalance an organization’s existing peaks and valleys\nWhen an organization’s products are currently in the declining stage of the product’s life cycle\nWhen an organization has a strong management team\n\nUnrelated diversification:\n\nWhen revenues derived from an organization’s current products would increase significantly by adding the new, unrelated products\nWhen an organization competes in a highly competitive or a no-growth industry, as indicated by low industry profit margins and returns\nWhen an organization’s present channels of distribution can be used to market the new products to current customers\nWhen the new products have countercyclical sales patterns compared to present products\nWhen an organization’s basic industry is experiencing declining annual sales and profits\nWhen an organization has the capital and managerial talent needed to compete successfully in a new industry\nWhen an organization has the opportunity to purchase an unrelated business that is an attractive investment opportunity\nWhen there exists financial synergy\nWhen existing markets for an organization’s present products are saturated\nWhen antitrust action could be charged against an organization that historically has concentrated on a single industry"

    "text": "Strategies\n\nLocating the core business:\n\nFocuses on identifying and concentrating on the core activities that define the organization’s essential business. This strategy involves a clear understanding of the core competencies and core products or services that the organization excels in. Resources are directed toward strengthening and emphasizing these core areas while potentially divesting from non-core activities.\n\nDistinguishing the core business\n\nFocuses on highlighting and differentiating the core business from competitors. Organizations pursuing this strategy work on creating unique selling propositions (USPs) for their core products or services. They aim to stand out in the market by emphasizing what makes their core offerings distinct and valuable to customers.\n\nElaborating the core business\n\nFocuses on expanding and deepening the core business to explore related opportunities. This strategy involves seeking growth and diversification within the boundaries of the core business. Organizations may introduce new products or services that are closely aligned with their existing core competencies and customer base.\n\nExtending the core business:\n\nFocuses on broadening the core business by exploring new markets or customer segments. Organizations using this strategy look for opportunities to leverage their existing core capabilities and enter new markets or customer groups. It may involve geographical expansion or targeting different demographics.\n\nReconceiving the core business\n\nFocuses on rethinking and transforming the core business to adapt to changing conditions. This strategy is about radical change and innovation. Organizations reassess their core business in response to significant shifts in the industry, technology, or market demands. It may involve redefining the core competencies and adopting a more disruptive approach.\n\n\n\nLocating the core business\nA business can be thought to exist at a junction in a network of industries (Mintzberg 1988).\n\nUpstream business strategy: the flow of the product seems to be divergent, from a basic material to a variety of uses for it. Upstream business tends to be technology and capital-intensive rather than people-intensive, and more inclined to search for advantage through low-cost than through high margins to favor sales push over market pull (e.g., Wieland producing copper semi-finished products).\nMidstream business strategy: here the organization sits at the neck of an hour glass, drawing a variety of inputs into a single production process out of which flows the prpduct to a variety of users (e.g., Apple producing iPhones).\nDownstream business strategy: here a wide variety of inputs converge into a narrow funnel (e.g., Mediamarkt selling many electronic products).\n\nMintzberg (1988) provides a way to analyze and prioritize the essential elements of an organization’s operations. This framework can help companies better understand where they should focus their efforts and resources to strengthen their core business and achieve competitive advantage.\n\n\nDistinguishing the core business\nThe concept of “distinguishing the core business” refers to a strategic approach where an organization emphasizes and differentiates its central or core activities from other non-core or peripheral aspects of its operations. It involves\n\nIdentifying core activities: Before a company can distinguish its core business, it must first identify what its core activities or competencies are. These are the fundamental processes, products, or services that define the essence of the organization and contribute significantly to its success.\nFocusing resources: Once the core activities are identified, the organization allocates a significant portion of its resources, such as talent, capital, and time, to support and strengthen these core elements. This focus ensures that the company excels in the areas that truly set it apart from competitors.\nEmphasizing differentiation: Distinguishing the core business involves creating a clear distinction between what the organization does exceptionally well (its core) and what may be less critical or peripheral to its overall mission. This differentiation often involves developing unique capabilities, expertise, or product/service features that are valued by customers.\nStrategic positioning: By emphasizing and differentiating the core business, the organization strategically positions itself as a leader or specialist in those core activities. This can help it compete more effectively, command premium prices, and build a strong brand reputation.\nResource allocation: The organization may channel a significant portion of its investments, both in terms of financial resources and talent, toward continuous improvement and innovation within the core business. This ongoing investment ensures that the core remains a source of competitive advantage.\n\nPorter’s framework of generic strategies constitute strategies to distinguish the core business. Cost leadership and differentiation align with the idea of distinguishing the core business by focusing on specific strengths, whether in cost efficiency or unique features. Focus strategy aligns with both concepts as it involves concentrating resources and efforts on a specific market segment or niche, which essentially becomes the organization’s core customer base.\n\n\nElaborating the core business\nAn organization can elaborate a business in a number of ways. It can develop its product offerings within that business, it can develop its market via new segments, new channels or new geographic areas, or it can simply push the same products more vigorously through the same markets. This relates well to the strategy types proposed by Ansoff (1965):\n\nPenetration strategies\nMarket development strategies (e.g., geographic extension)\nProduct development strategies\nDiversification strategies\n\n\n\nExtending the core business\nOrganizations might chose to extend their operating chains vertically or horizontally.\n\nVertical integration means backward or forward integration in the operating chain (downstream or upstream; i.e., chain integration strategies)\n\nForward integration: gaining ownership or increased control over distributors or retailers\nBackward integration: seeking ownership or increased control of a firm’s suppliers\n\nHorizontal integration means seeking ownership or increased control over competitors in the saim value chain\n\nThe business can be extended either by internal development or acquisition.\n\n\nReconceiving the core business\nBusiness redefinition represents a complete reimagining of the core business. Mintzberg (1988) identifies three basic reconception strategies:\n\nBusiness redefinition strategy involves fundamentally redefining the organization’s purpose, identity, and core activities in response to changing market conditions or disruptive forces.\nBusiness recombination strategy involves reconfiguring existing resources, capabilities, or business units in new and innovative ways to create value.\nCore relocation strategy refers to shifting the primary focus and resources of the organization from one area or aspect of the business to another."

    "section": "5 Ps for Strategy",
    "text": "5 Ps for Strategy\n\n\nStrategy as plan, ploy, pattern, position, and perspective.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as plan\nStrategy’ sometimes refers to a plan – some sort of consciously intended course of action, or a set of guidelines to deal with a situation. By this definition, strategies have two essential characteristics:\n\nThey are made in advance of intended actions.\nThey are developed consciously and purposefully before taking action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAn automobile manufacturer develops a detailed 5-year strategic plan outlining product launches, market expansion, and cost reduction targets. This plan serves as a roadmap for the company’s future actions and resource allocation.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as ploy\nA ploy refers to a specific maneuver or tactic employed to outwit competitors or achieve a particular objective. Ploys can be thought of as strategic tricks or moves, often aimed at exploiting competitors’ weaknesses or changing the competitive landscape.\n\nStrategy as ploy is a specific ‘manoeuvre’ intended to outwit an opponent or competitor.\nStrategy as ploy takes advantage of the opponent or competitor vulnerability.\nStrategy as ploy may involve diversion or deception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA beverage company lowers the prices of its products temporarily to gain a competitive advantage during a specific promotion or to respond to a competitor’s move. This pricing ploy is a tactical strategy aimed at achieving short-term objectives.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as a pattern\nPatterns in strategy refer to the consistency and regularity of actions and decisions over time (i.e., a pattern in a stream of actions). These patterns emerge from the cumulative effect of an organization’s actions and reveal its strategy in practice, regardless of whether it aligns with the formal plan.\n\nStrategy is consistency in behavior, whether or not intended.\nWhile plans refer to the intended strategy, patterns refer to the realized strategy.\nPlans and patterns can be quite independent of each other: plans may go unrealized, while patterns may appear without preconception.\n\nThus deliberate strategies–where intentions that existed previously are realized–can be distinguished from emergent strategies–where patterns developed in the absence of/despite intentions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA fast-food chain consistently focuses on introducing new menu items and promotions every season. Over time, customers come to expect and anticipate these recurring patterns of innovation, which become a distinctive part of the company’s strategy. Strategy as Position:\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as position\nPositioning in strategy involves finding a distinctive and favorable place in the market or industry. It focuses on creating a competitive advantage by being unique in some way, whether through pricing, product features, or other factors.\n\nStrategy seeks a match between the internal and the external context. Thus, strategy could be a niche, a unique place that generates rent, or a product-market domain.\nA position can be targeted/aspired to through a plan, or it may be found through a pattern of behavior.\n\nPosition may be defined with respect to a single competitor, multiple competitors or the market at large, strategies to avoid competition and even strategies to subvert the forces of competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA luxury fashion brand positions itself as a high-end, exclusive label with a limited distribution network and premium pricing. This strategic position aims to appeal to a niche market of affluent customers seeking luxury and prestige.\n\n\n\n\nStrategy as perspective\nStrategy is a perspective – an ingrained way of perceiving the world, a collective intuition about how the world works. It can also be referred to as culture, or ideology.\nThis definition takes a very broad view of strategy. It highlights two key points:\n\nPerspective in this context is collective—it is shared by members of the organisation.\nStrategy is a concept—it is an abstraction that exists only in the minds of the interested parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nAn environmentally conscious company adopts a perspective of sustainability and eco-friendliness in all its business operations. This perspective informs product development, sourcing of materials, and marketing, aligning the organization’s strategy with its commitment to environmental responsibility."

    "text": "Overview\n\n\nDesign, positioning, planning, entrepreneurial, cognitive, learning, power, cultural, environmental & configurational\n\n\n\nStrategy literature has been characterized by ten major schools since its inception in the 1960s – three prescriptive and seven descriptive (Mintzberg 2014).\nThese perspectives are both, fundamentally different processes of strategy development and implementation, reflecting the complexity and diversity of the field of strategic management, as well as different parts of the same process.\n\nDesign and planning schools: a process of conception\nThe schools view strategy as a formal, deliberate process where top management sets clear objectives and plans to achieve them. They emphasize careful analysis and structured planning, where senior management formulates clear, simple and unique strategies in a deliberate process of conscious thought, which are then implemented by others.\nThe key idea of the planning schoool is that the strategy making process is not just cerebral, but formal – decomposable into distinct step, delineated by checklists and supported by techniques (with regard to objectives, budgets, programmes and operating plans). Staff planners replace senior managers as the key players in the process.\nThe design and planning schools primarily focus on the formulation stage of strategic management. They provide structured frameworks and guidelines for setting objectives, analyzing the environment, and making deliberate strategic choices.\n\n\nPositioning school: an analytical process\nThe positionting schoold advocates for finding a unique market position or competitive advantage to succeed. Strategy is about selecting the right “position” in the marketplace through formalized analyses of industry situations. Hence, analysts become the key players in the process.\n\n\nEntrepreneurial school: a visionary process\nEmphasizes the role of visionary leaders and entrepreneurs in shaping strategy. Strategy is often driven by individuals’ instincts and creativity. In this regards the chief executive of the organisation is the central player. Strategy making is intuitive, and takes shape as a vision or broad perspective.\nThe entrepreneurial school is relevant when organizations seek to introduce innovative or disruptive strategies. It highlights the role of visionary leaders in shaping strategy.\n\n\nCognitive school: a mental process\nFocuses on the mental processes and perceptions of decision-makers. Strategies emerge from the way individuals think and interpret information. Strategies develop in people’s minds as frames/models/maps/concepts/schemas. Strategy formation is influenced by cognitive biases.\nThis school is particularly relevant during the decision-making phase of strategy. It focuses on how cognitive processes, mental models, and biases influence strategic choices.\n\n\nLearning school: an emergent process\nIn this view, strategies are emergent, strategists can be found throughout the organisation, and formulation and implementation intertwine, as the organisation learns from its past experiences to guide future action.\nIt emphasizes the importance of organizational learning and adaptation. It is relevant throughout the strategic management process, as organizations need to adapt their strategies based on new information and experiences.\n\n\nPower school: a process of negotiation\nFocuses on the role of power and politics in strategy. Strategy is often the result of power struggles and negotiations within an organization. There are two separate orientations of this school of thought:\n\nMicro power views the development of strategies within the organisation as a political process involving bargaining, persuasion and confrontation among actors who divide the power.\nMacro power views the organisation as an entity that uses its power over others, and among its partners in alliances, joint ventures, network relationships to negotiate ‘collective’ strategies in its interest.\n\nThis school is relevant during decision-making and implementation phases. It acknowledges the role of power dynamics, politics, and negotiations in shaping and executing strategies.\n\n\nCultural school: a social process\nRecognizes that organizational culture plays a significant role in shaping strategy. Strategy is influenced by shared values and norms within the organization. Strategy formation is viewed as a social process rooted in culture – it focuses on common interest and integration.\nThe cultural school is closely tied to understanding and leveraging organizational culture. It is relevant throughout the strategic management process, as organizational culture can impact strategy formulation, implementation, and adaptation.\n\n\nEnvironmental school: a reactive process\nThis school highlights the demands of the external environment, and is concerned with how organisations use degrees of freedom to manoeuvre through their environments. Organizations must adapt to changes in their external context.\nThis school is particularly relevant during the environmental scanning phase of strategic management. It emphasizes the need to monitor and adapt to changes in the external environment.\n\n\nConfiguration school: a process of transformation\nArgues that competitive advantage comes from a firm’s unique resources and capabilities. Strategy is about leveraging these strengths.\nOne aspect of this school views organisations as configurations of resources — coherent clusters of characteristics and behaviours – and integrates the views of the other schools, i.e. each school of thought has its own place in particular organisational types/configurations.\nChange is, therefore, a process of dramatic transformation – a leap from one configuration to another. This forms the second aspect of the configuration school."

It is the stage where an organization identifies its goals, assesses its resources and capabilities, and makes decisions about the direction it should take (Mintzberg 2014).\n\nDuring the formulation phase, organizations engage in activities such as strategic planning, setting objectives, conducting a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), and making strategic choices.\nFormulation primarily focuses on the “what” and “why” of strategy. It answers questions about what the organization wants to achieve and why those objectives are important.\nTop management and leaders play a central role in the formulation of strategy. They make critical decisions about the organization’s mission, vision, and overall strategic direction.\n\n\n\nImplementation of strategy\nImplementation of strategy refers to the actions and processes that transform formulated strategies into operational activities and results. It’s the stage where plans are put into action (Mintzberg 2014).\n\nImplementation involves allocating resources, setting up systems and processes, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring that the organization’s day-to-day activities align with the chosen strategy.\nThe implementation phase focuses on the “how” of strategy. It addresses the practical steps and actions needed to achieve the strategic goals and objectives.\nMiddle and lower-level management, as well as employees throughout the organization, play crucial roles in strategy implementation. They are responsible for executing the strategy in their respective areas.\nImplementation often presents challenges related to coordination, communication, resource allocation, and organizational culture. It requires ongoing monitoring and adjustments to ensure alignment with the formulated strategy.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of strategy\nEvaluation of strategy involves the systematic assessment of how well a company’s formulated and implemented strategies are performing in achieving its goals and objectives (Mintzberg 2014).\n\nEvaluation typically includes monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), measuring progress toward strategic objectives, conducting regular reviews of strategy implementation, and assessing the impact of external changes on the strategy’s effectiveness.\nEvaluation focuses on assessing the outcomes and results of the strategies and initiatives that have been put in place. It helps organizations determine whether their strategies are on track and whether adjustments are needed.\nEvaluation involves various levels of management, from top leadership to middle and lower-level managers responsible for specific aspects of the strategy. It is a collaborative effort to ensure that the strategy remains relevant and effective.\nEvaluating strategy can be challenging due to the need for accurate data and the complexities of measuring the impact of strategic decisions. It requires the ability to adapt and make changes based on the evaluation findings."

    "section": "5 Ps for Strategy",
    "text": "5 Ps for Strategy\n\n\nStrategy as plan, ploy, pattern, position, and perspective.\n\n\n\nStrategy as plan\nStrategy’ sometimes refers to a plan – some sort of consciously intended course of action, or a set of guidelines to deal with a situation. By this definition, strategies have two essential characteristics:\n\nThey are made in advance of intended actions.\nThey are developed consciously and purposefully before taking action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAn automobile manufacturer develops a detailed 5-year strategic plan outlining product launches, market expansion, and cost reduction targets. This plan serves as a roadmap for the company’s future actions and resource allocation.\n\n\n\nStrategy as ploy\nA ploy refers to a specific maneuver or tactic employed to outwit competitors or achieve a particular objective. Ploys can be thought of as strategic tricks or moves, often aimed at exploiting competitors’ weaknesses or changing the competitive landscape.\n\nStrategy as ploy is a specific ‘manoeuvre’ intended to outwit an opponent or competitor.\nStrategy as ploy takes advantage of the opponent or competitor vulnerability.\nStrategy as ploy may involve diversion or deception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nA beverage company lowers the prices of its products temporarily to gain a competitive advantage during a specific promotion or to respond to a competitor’s move. This pricing ploy is a tactical strategy aimed at achieving short-term objectives.\n\n\n\nStrategy as a pattern\nPatterns in strategy refer to the consistency and regularity of actions and decisions over time (i.e., a pattern in a stream of actions). These patterns emerge from the cumulative effect of an organization’s actions and reveal its strategy in practice, regardless of whether it aligns with the formal plan.\n\nStrategy is consistency in behavior, whether or not intended.\nWhile plans refer to the intended strategy, patterns refer to the realized strategy.\nPlans and patterns can be quite independent of each other: plans may go unrealized, while patterns may appear without preconception.\n\nThus deliberate strategies–where intentions that existed previously are realized–can be distinguished from emergent strategies–where patterns developed in the absence of/despite intentions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nA fast-food chain consistently focuses on introducing new menu items and promotions every season. Over time, customers come to expect and anticipate these recurring patterns of innovation, which become a distinctive part of the company’s strategy. Strategy as Position:\n\n\n\nStrategy as position\nPositioning in strategy involves finding a distinctive and favorable place in the market or industry. It focuses on creating a competitive advantage by being unique in some way, whether through pricing, product features, or other factors.\n\nStrategy seeks a match between the internal and the external context. Thus, strategy could be a niche, a unique place that generates rent, or a product-market domain.\nA position can be targeted/aspired to through a plan, or it may be found through a pattern of behavior.\n\nPosition may be defined with respect to a single competitor, multiple competitors or the market at large, strategies to avoid competition and even strategies to subvert the forces of competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nA luxury fashion brand positions itself as a high-end, exclusive label with a limited distribution network and premium pricing. This strategic position aims to appeal to a niche market of affluent customers seeking luxury and prestige.\n\n\n\nStrategy as perspective\nStrategy is a perspective – an ingrained way of perceiving the world, a collective intuition about how the world works. It can also be referred to as culture, or ideology.\nThis definition takes a very broad view of strategy. It highlights two key points:\n\nPerspective in this context is collective—it is shared by members of the organisation.\nStrategy is a concept—it is an abstraction that exists only in the minds of the interested parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAn environmentally conscious company adopts a perspective of sustainability and eco-friendliness in all its business operations. This perspective informs product development, sourcing of materials, and marketing, aligning the organization’s strategy with its commitment to environmental responsibility."

Together, they can enhance our ability to understand/manage the processes by which strategies form."

    "text": "Overview\n\n\nDesign, positioning, planning, entrepreneurial, cognitive, learning, power, cultural, environmental & configurational\n\n\n\nStrategy literature has been characterized by ten major schools since its inception in the 1960s – three prescriptive and seven descriptive (Mintzberg 2014).\nThese perspectives are both, fundamentally different processes of strategy development and implementation, reflecting the complexity and diversity of the field of strategic management, as well as different parts of the same process.\nDesign and planning schools: a process of conception\nThe schools view strategy as a formal, deliberate process where top management sets clear objectives and plans to achieve them. They emphasize careful analysis and structured planning, where senior management formulates clear, simple and unique strategies in a deliberate process of conscious thought, which are then implemented by others.\nThe key idea of the planning schoool is that the strategy making process is not just cerebral, but formal – decomposable into distinct step, delineated by checklists and supported by techniques (with regard to objectives, budgets, programmes and operating plans). Staff planners replace senior managers as the key players in the process.\nThe design and planning schools primarily focus on the formulation stage of strategic management. They provide structured frameworks and guidelines for setting objectives, analyzing the environment, and making deliberate strategic choices.\nPositioning school: an analytical process\nThe positionting schoold advocates for finding a unique market position or competitive advantage to succeed. Strategy is about selecting the right “position” in the marketplace through formalized analyses of industry situations. Hence, analysts become the key players in the process.\nEntrepreneurial school: a visionary process\nEmphasizes the role of visionary leaders and entrepreneurs in shaping strategy. Strategy is often driven by individuals’ instincts and creativity. In this regards the chief executive of the organisation is the central player. Strategy making is intuitive, and takes shape as a vision or broad perspective.\nThe entrepreneurial school is relevant when organizations seek to introduce innovative or disruptive strategies. It highlights the role of visionary leaders in shaping strategy.\nCognitive school: a mental process\nFocuses on the mental processes and perceptions of decision-makers. Strategies emerge from the way individuals think and interpret information. Strategies develop in people’s minds as frames/models/maps/concepts/schemas. Strategy formation is influenced by cognitive biases.\nThis school is particularly relevant during the decision-making phase of strategy. It focuses on how cognitive processes, mental models, and biases influence strategic choices.\nLearning school: an emergent process\nIn this view, strategies are emergent, strategists can be found throughout the organisation, and formulation and implementation intertwine, as the organisation learns from its past experiences to guide future action.\nIt emphasizes the importance of organizational learning and adaptation. It is relevant throughout the strategic management process, as organizations need to adapt their strategies based on new information and experiences.\nPower school: a process of negotiation\nFocuses on the role of power and politics in strategy. Strategy is often the result of power struggles and negotiations within an organization. There are two separate orientations of this school of thought:\n\nMicro power views the development of strategies within the organisation as a political process involving bargaining, persuasion and confrontation among actors who divide the power.\nMacro power views the organisation as an entity that uses its power over others, and among its partners in alliances, joint ventures, network relationships to negotiate ‘collective’ strategies in its interest.\n\nThis school is relevant during decision-making and implementation phases. It acknowledges the role of power dynamics, politics, and negotiations in shaping and executing strategies.\nCultural school: a social process\nRecognizes that organizational culture plays a significant role in shaping strategy. Strategy is influenced by shared values and norms within the organization. Strategy formation is viewed as a social process rooted in culture – it focuses on common interest and integration.\nThe cultural school is closely tied to understanding and leveraging organizational culture. It is relevant throughout the strategic management process, as organizational culture can impact strategy formulation, implementation, and adaptation.\nEnvironmental school: a reactive process\nThis school highlights the demands of the external environment, and is concerned with how organisations use degrees of freedom to manoeuvre through their environments. Organizations must adapt to changes in their external context.\nThis school is particularly relevant during the environmental scanning phase of strategic management. It emphasizes the need to monitor and adapt to changes in the external environment.\nConfiguration school: a process of transformation\nArgues that competitive advantage comes from a firm’s unique resources and capabilities. Strategy is about leveraging these strengths.\nOne aspect of this school views organisations as configurations of resources — coherent clusters of characteristics and behaviours – and integrates the views of the other schools, i.e. each school of thought has its own place in particular organisational types/configurations.\nChange is, therefore, a process of dramatic transformation – a leap from one configuration to another. This forms the second aspect of the configuration school."

These trends are characterized by their sustained and pervasive influence over many years, often spanning decades. Megatrends shape the business landscape, influence consumer behavior, drive technological innovation, and create both opportunities and challenges for businesses and other stakeholders.\nKey characteristics and aspects of the concept of megatrends include:\n\nLong-term perspective: Megatrends unfold over extended periods, typically spanning 10 to 20 years or more. They represent enduring shifts in societal, economic, and technological dynamics.\nGlobal impact: Megatrends transcend geographical boundaries and affect countries, regions, and industries worldwide. They have a broad and pervasive reach.\nTransformational effects: Megatrends bring about fundamental changes and transformations in various domains, including demographics, technology, environment, politics, and culture. They reshape the way people live, work, and interact.\nCross-industry relevance: Megatrends impact multiple industries and sectors, often requiring organizations to adapt, innovate, and adjust their strategies to remain competitive and relevant.\nStrategic implications: Organizations must consider megatrends in their strategic planning processes. Failure to do so can result in missed opportunities or exposure to risks associated with not aligning with the evolving landscape."

These trends are characterized by their sustained and pervasive influence over many years, often spanning decades. Megatrends shape the business landscape, influence consumer behavior, drive technological innovation, and create both opportunities and challenges for businesses and other stakeholders.\nKey characteristics and aspects of the concept of megatrends include:\n\nLong-term perspective: Megatrends unfold over extended periods, typically spanning 10 to 20 years or more. They represent enduring shifts in societal, economic, and technological dynamics.\nGlobal impact: Megatrends transcend geographical boundaries and affect countries, regions, and industries worldwide. They have a broad and pervasive reach.\nTransformational effects: Megatrends bring about fundamental changes and transformations in various domains, including demographics, technology, environment, politics, and culture. They reshape the way people live, work, and interact.\nCross-industry relevance: Megatrends impact multiple industries and sectors, often requiring organizations to adapt, innovate, and adjust their strategies to remain competitive and relevant.\nStrategic implications: Organizations must consider megatrends in their strategic planning processes. Failure to do so can result in missed opportunities or exposure to risks associated with not aligning with the evolving landscape."

They are an effective means of educating employees, especially when management visibly supports and emphasizes them.\nA clear and consistent expression of moral convictions has a strong unifying cultural effect in the organization and gives it the intellectual power to manage ethical conflicts and avoid critical pitfalls.\nAnother aspect of ethical strategy is predicting and preparing for the future, for example by anticipating possible cultural and value-related changes."

They propose that moderate social responsibility can positively impact financial performance, but there might be diminishing returns or potential negative effects beyond a certain point of social responsibility.\nThe authors emphasize that while a moderate level of social responsibility can be associated with improved financial performance, pursuing excessive social responsibility might not necessarily lead to better financial results. They suggest that companies need to find an optimal level of social responsibility that aligns with their strategic goals and business context.\nBarnett and Salomon (2012) offer insights into the complex relationship between social and financial performance in organizations, highlighting that while being socially responsible can positively influence financial outcomes to a certain extent, an excessively high level of social responsibility might not always be conducive to improved financial performance.

IT encompasses all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the behavior of individuals and entire organizations.\nBusiness ethics, according to Drucker (1981), is about ensuring that business practices, decisions, and operations adhere to ethical standards and contribute positively to society while fulfilling the company’s objectives and obligations to its stakeholders."

They are an effective means of educating employees, especially when management visibly supports and emphasizes them.\nA clear and consistent expression of moral convictions has a strong unifying cultural effect in the organization and gives it the intellectual power to manage ethical conflicts and avoid critical pitfalls.\nAnother aspect of ethical strategy is predicting and preparing for the future, for example by anticipating possible cultural and value-related changes."

The theory is then tested using measures that represent variables, and data is collected from real-world phenomena. Figure 3 points to two main challenges in this process.\n\nShared meaning: If the connection between theoretical concepts and measures is unclear, measuring the constructs accurately becomes difficult. Ensuring accurate measurements minimizes data problems. However, without shared meaning, even accurate measurements won’t reflect the intended constructs. For instance, if you’re studying emotions related to technology and you confuse “compassion” with a similar concept like “empathy,” issues arise.\nAaccuracy of measurement: Researchers need accurate data to draw valid conclusions. No matter the analysis, conclusions are unreliable without data reliability.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Measures and measurements based on Burton-Jones and Lee (2017)\n\n\n\n\nPhases and outcomes\n\n\n\n\nPhases and outcomes of the operationalization process\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConceptualization\nConceptualization refers to the definition of fuzzy and imprecise, vague and ambiguous constructs of social science in concrete and precise terms. It aims at ensuring shared meaning about the constructs at the theoretical level. It often requires to separate related constructs conceptually (i.e., providing clear definitions)\nConstruct conceptualization involves identifying and defining what the construct is intended to represent or capture conceptually, discussing how the construct differs from other related constructs, and defining any dimensions or content domains that are relevant to grasping and defining the conceptual theme of the construct it its entirety. Each construct should have (1) a label, (2) a definition, (3) ideally one or more examples that demonstrate its meaning (as a demonstration of face validity), and (4) a discussion of related constructs in the literature. Papers and theses often use construct definition tables for this purpose, where each of the four points becomes a column and each construct in the study has its own row (Recker 2021, 100).\n\n\nNature of constructs\nConstructs can be unidimensional or multidimensional (Wright et al. 2012).\n\nUnidimensional constructs are expected to have a single underlying dimension. They can be measured using a single measure or test. For instance, a person’s weight and age are simple unidimensional constructs.\nMultidimensional constructs consist of two or more underlying dimensions. Each dimension must be measured separately (either reflective or formative). For instance, a persons’ academic ability can be conceptualized as consisting of two dimensions: mathematical and verbal ability.\n\n\n\nFrom the theoretical to the empirical dimension\nOperationalization refers to the development of indicators or items for measuring theoretically defined constructs at the empirical level. For instance, the unobservable theoretical construct “socioeconomic status” could be defined as the ‘level of family income’ and thus operationalized using an indicator (interchangeably used terms: indicator question, item) that asks respondents for the annual family income\nThe combination of indicators at the empirical level representing a given construct is called a variable. Variables may be independent, dependent, mediating or moderating (i.e., the cause, the outcome, the underlying mechanism or condition)\n\n\nScales\nEach indicator may have several attributes (or levels) and each attribute represent a value (e.g., a gender variable may have two attributes).\nCommon rating scales are\n\nNominal scales for categorial data (e.g., gender)\nLikert-type scales for latent constructs, measuring ordinal data by simply-worded statements to which respondents can indicate their extent of agreement (e.g., using Excel would improve my job performance.)\n\n\n\n\n\nReliability and validity\n\n\n\n\nMeeting requirements for validity and reliability (Recker 2021, 93)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Meeting requirements for validity and reliability (Recker 2021, 93)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidity and reliability in research\n\n\n\nInternal validity (causality) examines whether the observed change in a dependent variable is indeed caused by a corresponding change in independent variable, and not by variables outside the research context. Different research designs vary considerably in their respective level of internal validity (e.g., experiments vs. field surveys).\nExternal validity (generalizability) refers to whether the observed associations can be generalized from the sample to the population, or to other people, organizations, contexts, or time (ecological validity).\nReliability refers to the consistency, stability, and reproducibility of measurement or data collection methods. It reflects the extent to which a measurement or research instrument produces consistent results when applied repeatedly under the same conditions.\n\n\nValidity of measurements represent the essence or content upon which the construct is focused, i.e., valid measurements measure what they intend to measure.\n\nTheoretical assessments assess how well an operationalization fits the conceptual definition of the relevant theoretical construct.\n\nFace validity: The indicator seems to be a reasonable measure of its underlying construct (“on its face”). Example: Is annual salary a good measure of job satisfaction? No.\nContent validity: A set of measurement items matches the content domain of the construct.\n\nEmpirical (statistical) assessments of validity, which assess how well a measurement behaves in correspondence to the theoretical predictions. Tests include convergent validity and discriminant validity; see Straub, Boudreau, and Gefen (2004).\n\nReliability describes the extent to which a variable or set of indicators is consistent in what it is intended to measure. If multiple measurements are taken, the reliable measurements will all be very consistent in their values.\n\nThe operations of a study can be repeated in equal settings with the same results\nReliability tries to decrease dependency on researcher’s subjectivity\nThere is a wide range of statistical reliability tests such as internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and composite reliability; see @Straub, Boudreau, and Gefen (2004)\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nTable 1: Scales from TAM (Venkatesh et al. 2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct\nDefinition\nIndicators\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Intention\nParticipant’s intentions\nto use a particular system\nin the future\n- I intend to use the system in the next  months\n- I predict I would use the system in the next  months\n- I plan to use the system in the next  months\n\n\nAttitude towards Behavior\nAn individual’s positive\nor negative feelings about\nperforming the target behavior.\n- Using the system is a bad/good idea\n- Using the system is a foolish/wise idea\n- I dislike/like the idea of using the system\n- Using the system is unpleasant/ pleasant\n\n\nPerceived Usefulness\nThe degree to which a\nperson believes that using\na particular system would\nenhance his or her job\nperformance.\n- Using the system in my job would enable me to accomplish tasks more quickly\n- Using the system would improve my job performance\n- Using the system in my job would increase my productivity\n- Using the system would enhance my effectiveness on the job\n- Using the system would make it easier to do my job\n- I would find the system useful in my job\n\n\nPerceived Ease of Use\nThe degree to which a person\nbelieves that using a system\nwould be free of effort.\n- Learning to operate the system would be easy for me\n- I would find it easy to get the system to do what I want it to do\n- My interaction with the system would be clear and understandable\n- I would find the system to be flexible to interact with\n- It would be easy for me to become skillful at using the system\n- I would find the system easy to use"

And why is this the case, or why not?\nHow might it inform your own thinking about the field?\nHow do you think the reading influenced the state of knowledge in the field at the time it was published?\n\nAdditional strategies\n\nUse highlighting or annotation: As you read, use highlighting, underlining, or digital annotation tools to mark key points, important concepts, and relevant citations. This can help you quickly locate and review important information later. Read Strategically: If you’re reading a longer paper, consider reading strategically by reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph. This can give you a sense of the main ideas without getting bogged down in every detail.\nFollow citations: If a paper references other works that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related resrks that are crucial to your research, consider following those citations to gather a broader understanding of the context and related research.\nTake breaks: Reading complex material for extended periods can lead to reduced comprehension. Take short breaks to maintain focus and prevent fatigue.\nUtilize summaries: In addition to reading full papers, consider using summaries, reviews, or annotated bibliographies to get an overview of key concepts and findings before deciding whether to delve into the complete paper."

Possible criteria are\n\nContent (topics or variables) has bearing to the research question\nPublication language can be read by the team\nLimitation to a select set of high-quality journals/conferences\nThe review might consider only those studies conducted in certain settings\nRestriction to works that study subjects of a certain gender, work situation\nFocus on studies in certain date ranges\n\n\n\nSearching for literature\nIt is most efficient to use open access databases (such as Google Scholar and the Directory of Open Access Journals) and specific subject databases (such as ProQuest, Scopus, EBSCO, IEEE Xplore and the ACM Digital Library) to search for literature.\nSearch queries that reflect the defined search and inclusion criteria need to be defined.\nThe search should be supplemented further by backward and forward search.\n\n\nExtracting data\nSystematic information extraction from each paper to elicit the raw material for the synthesis step. The type of data to extract is based on the research question established during the protocol phase.\nQualitative coding techniques and related software packages can be used to extract data (e.g., MaxQDA or NVivo)\nRecommendation: Video tutorial „Using MAXQDA for a literature review“\nFurther reads: Fink (2019) and Keele et al.

Example: We wanted to find out how the Covid-19 virus infects people so we could devise treatments and vaccinations that hinder the mechanism by which the virus infects people.\n\n\nType 2 questions often temporally succeed type 1 questions as it is difficult to explain a phenomenon without first systematically exploring and describing it."

    "text": "Quality-checks\nThe research question help you focus the study and give you guidance for how to conduct it.\nRecker (2021) proposes following principles to reflect on if a RQ serves these functions well.\n\n\nShort: Research questions have to be concise (rule of thumb: one line of text, max. 1.5 lines).\nFeasible: You should have answers to at least following questions: Are you able to observe all concepts you use in the research question? Are adequate subjects of study available? How will you collect the data? How will you analyze the data? Do you have the technical expertise, the time and money?\nInteresting: You are confident that you can maintain an interest in the topic and maintain your own motivation to study it.\nNovel: An answer will confirm or refute previous findings or provide new findings.\nEthical: Pursuing and answering the question will not violate ethical principles for the conduct of research, and will not put the safety of the investigators or subjects at risk.\nRelevant: Both the question and the future answer(s) are important in the sense that they inform scientific knowledge, industry practice, and future research directions.\n\n\n\nIn addition, consider the following checks:\n\nResearch questions have to be formulated in a way that they cannot be answered by Yes or No or similar binary results.\nResearch can not directly answer practical questions such as “How can I improve X?” To address such practical questions, you need to focus on what you don’t understand about the phenomena you are studying, and investigate what is really going on with these phenomena.\nResearch questions should not ask for potentially infinite lists of factors such as “What factors influence…”. Such questions are too vague and thus do not provide the focus needed.\nDo not pack several questions into one sentence. Typical sign for several questions within one sentence are connections with “and” or “or”. Each question has to be presented in a separate sentence and has to be formulated as explicit question with question mark at the end of the sentence.\nResearch questions often relate one or more variables to one another and ask for relationships. In the following “y” means the dependent variable (the variable to be explained, improved, influenced,..) and “x” the independent variables (= the variable that are assumed to exert an influence on y). Research questions often look like this: „How is x related to y? What is the role of x for y? Why does x influence y? To which extent does x influence y?\n\nThe expression “To which extent” when used in research questions needs statistical evaluations and measurement in numbers. They typically cannot be answered by qualitative research.\nFor empirical work, the research question needs at least two precisely formulated variables. Checkpoints: Does the question contain at least two variables that are formulated in a way that you can imagine that they can be measured? What could be the source of data? Is there access to the data?\nVariables should not express an activity or process because that would require a longitudinal study (= study over time with several measurement periods). This typically exceeds the timeframe of a master’s thesis."

Example: We wanted to find out how the Covid-19 virus infects people so we could devise treatments and vaccinations that hinder the mechanism by which the virus infects people.\n\n\nType 2 questions often temporally succeed type 1 questions as it is difficult to explain a phenomenon without first systematically exploring and describing it."

    "text": "Quality-checks\nThe research question help you focus the study and give you guidance for how to conduct it.\n\nRecker (2021) proposes following principles to reflect on if a RQ serves these functions well.\n\n\nShort: Research questions have to be concise (rule of thumb: one line of text, max. 1.5 lines).\nFeasible: You should have answers to at least following questions: Are you able to observe all concepts you use in the research question? Are adequate subjects of study available? How will you collect the data? How will you analyze the data? Do you have the technical expertise, the time and money?\nInteresting: You are confident that you can maintain an interest in the topic and maintain your own motivation to study it.\nNovel: An answer will confirm or refute previous findings or provide new findings.\nEthical: Pursuing and answering the question will not violate ethical principles for the conduct of research, and will not put the safety of the investigators or subjects at risk.\nRelevant: Both the question and the future answer(s) are important in the sense that they inform scientific knowledge, industry practice, and future research directions.\n\n\n\nIn addition, consider the following checks:\n\nResearch questions have to be formulated in a way that they cannot be answered by Yes or No or similar binary results.\nResearch can not directly answer practical questions such as “How can I improve X?” To address such practical questions, you need to focus on what you don’t understand about the phenomena you are studying, and investigate what is really going on with these phenomena.\nResearch questions should not ask for potentially infinite lists of factors such as “What factors influence…”. Such questions are too vague and thus do not provide the focus needed.\nDo not pack several questions into one sentence. Typical sign for several questions within one sentence are connections with “and” or “or”. Each question has to be presented in a separate sentence and has to be formulated as explicit question with question mark at the end of the sentence.\nResearch questions often relate one or more variables to one another and ask for relationships. In the following “y” means the dependent variable (the variable to be explained, improved, influenced,..) and “x” the independent variables (= the variable that are assumed to exert an influence on y). Research questions often look like this: „How is x related to y? What is the role of x for y? Why does x influence y? To which extent does x influence y?\n\nThe expression “To which extent” when used in research questions needs statistical evaluations and measurement in numbers. They typically cannot be answered by qualitative research.\nFor empirical work, the research question needs at least two precisely formulated variables. Checkpoints: Does the question contain at least two variables that are formulated in a way that you can imagine that they can be measured? What could be the source of data? Is there access to the data?\nVariables should not express an activity or process because that would require a longitudinal study (= study over time with several measurement periods). This typically exceeds the timeframe of a master’s thesis."

Often involves induction.\n\nRationalization\n\nMaking sense of the puzzle or problem that interests us. Often involves abduction.\n\nValidation\n\nSubjecting an emergent or existing theory to rigorous examination and testing. Often involves deduction.\n\n\nDifferent research methods can be used as a tool to support inductive, deductive, or abductive reasoning.\n\n\n\nDeduction\n\n\nDrawing a conclusion from a general premise to a specific instance: from theory to data.\n\n\n\nDeduction is a form of logical reasoning that involves deriving arguments as logical consequences of a set of more general premises (i.e., justification). It involves deducing a conclusion from a general premise (i.e., a known theory) to a specific instance (i.e., an observation) (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Deduction involves starting with general principles, theories, or hypotheses and deriving specific predictions or conclusions from them.\nProcess: Researchers begin with a set of premises or assumptions and use logical reasoning to draw specific implications or hypotheses.\nPurpose: The primary goal of deduction is to test the validity of a general theory or hypothesis by examining its specific implications.\nProblem: If the premise is incorrect, the deduction becomes invalid.\nExample: If all humans are mortal (general premise), and Socrates is a human (specific premise), then it can be deduced that Socrates is mortal.\n\n\n\n\nInduction\n\n\nInferring a general conclusion from a set of specific observations: from data to theory.\n\n\n\nA form of logical reasoning that involves inferring a general conclusion from a set of specific facts or observations (i.e., formal inference). It is used to infer theoretical concepts and patterns from observed data or known facts to generate new knowledge by proceeding from particulars to generals (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Induction involves deriving general principles, theories, or (tentative) conclusions from specific observations or evidence.\nProcess: Researchers gather specific data or evidence and use it to draw broader patterns, generalizations, or theories.\nProblem: Inductive arguments, which can be weak or strong, cannot be justified, only supported or not supported.\nPurpose: Induction aims to develop new theories, patterns, or generalizations based on observed evidence.\nExample: Observing that all observed swans are white (specific observations) leads to the generalization that all swans are white (general principle).\n\n\n\n\nAbduction\n\n\nMaking sense of an observation by drawing inferences about the best possible explanation: educated guessing.\n\n\n\nAbduction is the process of making sense of an observation by drawing inferences about the best possible explanation for an observed consequence after the fact (Recker 2021).\n\nNature: Abduction involves creating plausible explanations or hypotheses to explain observed phenomena.\nProcess: Researchers propose potential explanations for observations or patterns, often guided by existing knowledge or theories.\nPurpose: Abduction is used when faced with surprising or unexpected observations that do not fit existing theories, aiming to generate new hypotheses for further investigation. It is geared toward the discovery of entirely new ideas rather then a mode of justification (through deduction) or formal inference (through induction).\nExample: If a crime scene has fingerprints but no eyewitnesses, and it’s known that criminals often leave fingerprints (existing knowledge), then it’s abductive to hypothesize that a criminal was present."

Good research typically moves back and forth among them, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe emphasis of any one study can be on either end (1,2,3) or in combination (e.g., 4). Often, only so-called research programs (combinations of multiple studies) can achieve all (5).\n\nWe may find that explaining a particular behavior requires that we collect additional observations about other behaviours that we did not identify as relevant to our initial exploration. The interplay between rationalization and exploration can also provide a set of initial evidence against which we can test the outcomes of our rationalization process or evaluate a set of tentative propositions between constructs that capture a phenomenon. The rationalization should be valid in light of any observations that we collected. Once a rationalization, in which tentative general propositions are created through inductive reasoning from observations or through abduction, has been made, we can proceed to validation, where we develop testable hypotheses or propositions for a particular context or scenario from our more general theory. These hypotheses can be subjected to further empirical tests using new or existing cases. The results or evidence collected may suggest that we revise our rationalization (moving from validation back to rationalization), which could involve abduction. For example, our validation may find an observable mechanism that speaks against the logic of our propositions, requiring us to make an educated guess about why it happened or how these observations can otherwise be explained.

Good research typically moves back and forth among them, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe emphasis of any one study can be on either end (1,2,3) or in combination (e.g., 4). Often, only so-called research programs (combinations of multiple studies) can achieve all (5).\n\nWe may find that explaining a particular behavior requires that we collect additional observations about other behaviours that we did not identify as relevant to our initial exploration. The interplay between rationalization and exploration can also provide a set of initial evidence against which we can test the outcomes of our rationalization process or evaluate a set of tentative propositions between constructs that capture a phenomenon. The rationalization should be valid in light of any observations that we collected. Once a rationalization, in which tentative general propositions are created through inductive reasoning from observations or through abduction, has been made, we can proceed to validation, where we develop testable hypotheses or propositions for a particular context or scenario from our more general theory. These hypotheses can be subjected to further empirical tests using new or existing cases. The results or evidence collected may suggest that we revise our rationalization (moving from validation back to rationalization), which could involve abduction. For example, our validation may find an observable mechanism that speaks against the logic of our propositions, requiring us to make an educated guess about why it happened or how these observations can otherwise be explained.

What am I feeling right now? What does this say about my values? An emotionally agile person is able to recognize their feelings with self-compassion and understanding.\nBeing more self-compassionate includes:\n\nletting go of self-criticism and expectations of perfection (within yourself, your work, your life at home);\nrecognizing that comparing yourself with others is, almost always, a losing game;\nunderstanding that self-compassion does not make you weak or lazy. In fact, research shows the opposite - that self-compassion sharpens your edge;\nappreciating that self-compassion is not about lying to yourself. People who are self-compassionate are more likely to face into the truth about themselves and their weaknesses, than those who lack self-compassion.\n\n\n\nStepping out\nStepping out means facing and labeling the problem. You need to take an objective view and assess your emotions. This can help you filter feelings that may not be entirely appropriate and to find ways to deal with what you are feeling.\nWhen you step out objectively, you are in control of your feelings and not the other way around.\nSkills you can cultivate:\n\nThe ability for you, the thinker, rather than the thought to be in charge, and for you, the person, rather than your emotions to be in charge. In other words, developing the skill that allows you to be centered, reflective and intentional in your reactions to events around you.\nDeveloping a ‘meta view’ or the ability to still feel your feelings and think your thoughts but to ‘helicopter’ above these in order to make effective decisions.\nThe ability to recognize when you are holding on to specific positions and ideas in ways that may not serve your life, and to let go of these.\n\n\n\nWalking your why\n‘Walking your why’ means discovering what is important to you and acting accordingly. When you walk your why, you live by your personal values as closely as you possibly can. Living by your values will help to make your life more meaningful and satisfying.\nWhile it is not always possible to work or live the exact life you wish, there is usually a way to make your life or job fit better within your values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome characteristics of values (S. David 2016)\n\n\n\nValues\n\nare freely chosen; have not been imposed on you;\nare not goals; they are ongoing rather than fixed;\nguide you rather then constrain you;\nare active not static;\nallow you to get closer to the way you want to life your life;\nbring you freedom from social comparison;\nfoster self-acceptance, which is crucial for mental health.\n\n\n\nWhen we move towards our values and are able to make choices that align us with who we want to be, that is incredibly empowering, and provides a new found sense of autonomy in difficult situations.\nTo make a difference in this area it may help you to:\n\nWatch the gaps: Simply noticing the gaps between your values and your behaviors in specific domains (at work, home, in your relationships or as they relate to your health and wellbeing) can help you to close them.\nThink first: “is my response in line with my values of Accountability, Straightforwardness and Challenge?”\nRemember that values are not abstract and intangible ideas. Rather they are qualities of action that you can bring to every day choices.\n\n\n\nMove on\nOnce you’ve unpacked what you’re feeling, why you’re feeling that way, and aligned your next steps with who you want to be in the situation, it’s time to move on and take action.\nEmotionally agile individuals handle situations as they come up, feel them fully, make a plan, and don’t delay.\nThis requires some critical areas of focus:\n\nA change mindset: developing the belief that positive change is actually possible. Research shows that subtle differences in our beliefs about change can have a long-term impact across many different areas of our lives.\nEffective motivations: trying to make a change based on a ‘have-to’ motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a sense of obligation to your doctor, spouse, or due to shame) is less likely to be effective than a change based on a ‘want-to’ motivation (e.g. to lose weight out of a genuine, internal desire to be healthier.) The type of motivation we have is critically important in determining whether a change will be successful.\nHabit tweaks: understanding how to master the physics of successful habit change.\nMoving to discomfort: making the choice to push oneself towards the edge of one’s comfort zone as one tries to develop skills and cultivate relationships."

It lets you know that your efforts are noticed, making you feel worthwhile. It taps into our primitive need for acceptance. It can be motivating; the anticipation of being appreciated can encourage a person to put in extra effort. It can also be very personal.\n\n\nCoaching\nCoaching is advice. It is aimed at helping you improve, learn, grow, or change, either to meet new challenges or to correct an existing problem. It helps you focus your time and energy where it matters, maintain strong relationships, and keep your efforts productive.\n\n\nEvaluation\nEvaluation is assessment. It accomplishes a number of things:\n\nIt tells you where you stand, how you rank, or how you are doing in relation to expectations and to other people. Report cards, performance reviews, medals, and even nicknames are all evaluations.\nIt aligns expectations between two people. Your performance review lets you know what your manager wants from you.\nIt clarifies consequences. Your rating determines your bonus.\nIt guides decision making. We decide whether or not to apply for the new position based on our understanding of how much our managers currently value us."

    "text": "Leadership\nScott (2019) advices leaders to be guided by two principles:\nCaring personally\n—care about your people on a personal level\nAND\nChallenging directly\n—have conversations where you criticize or disagree with decisions your people made\n\nAs a leader, a significant aspect of your job is dealing with the personal and professional problems of the people that report to you or work with you in a less hierarchical setting. Kim Scott1 even states that relationship maintenance should be a top priority when you move into a leadership position. She advises leaders in radical candid communication (Scott 2019)—straightforward and humanizing management, following the principles outlined below1 A leader of high-profile teams in the Silicon Valley at Google, Apple and Twitter.\n\nCaring personally\nCaring personally means caring about people for more than just their jobs. As a leader, you need to care about them on a personal level. This includes learning more about them as a person—their interests, motivations, and ambitions—and learning more about their “whole self”—who they are outside of work and how their personal life might impact their needs at work.\nWhen you show that you care personally about your employees, their trust in you grows. This has far-reaching implications: When your employees trust you and feel that you have their best interests at heart, they will be honest with you, more receptive to your feedback, and more confident in your decisions. Likewise, you will find that you can be more honest with them and have more confidence in their decisions.\nWe often fail to care personally. One reason is that work culture encourages us to stay professional and hide our feelings. Another one, less virtuous, is a tendency to become arrogant once you find yourself in a boss chair.\n\n\nChallenging directly\nChallenging directly means having difficult but necessary conversations with your employees, e.g., conversations where you criticize or disagree with decisions they’ve made. These conversations might feel too difficult, especially if you haven’t had a chance to build a caring, trusting relationship with the person in question. However, you have to let the principle of challenging directly drive you into these discussions for several important reasons.\nFirst, these conversations offer the recipient of the feedback an opportunity to improve and avoid further problems and difficult conversations. Second, by being direct, you show that you care about the person and their improvement enough to put up with the inconvenience of a difficult conversation. This, of course, helps you build a trusting relationship with the person you are talking to.\nIf, on the other hand, you didn’t adhere to the principles of radical openness and avoided the conversation, your employee would continue to fall short - and he would probably know it. If you constantly reassure him that everything is “fine,” it shows that you are not being honest with him when necessary, and that destroys the potential for a trusting relationship."

Praise from a place of radical candor is very specific to the recipient—when you are acting with radical candor, you should be attuned to how your praise is landing with your recipient and be prepared to change it if it’s not quite right.\npraise—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements. Criticism from a place of radical candor is always sincere, and is given both when things go poorly and when things go well.\n\nIf you succeed in two of the dimensions, your guidance is Radical Candor. But what if you fail, in one of those or in both? To demonstrate that, Scott (2019) draws a coordinate system, where care personally is Y, and challenge directly is X. This way, she comes up with three other types of guidance, analyzing those through the prism of criticism and praise.\n\nOffensive aggression\nOffensive aggression happens when a boss treats employees without respect, belittling and publicly embarrassing them. Obnoxiously aggressive criticism can be effective but at a very high cost: it “sometimes gets great results short-term but leaves a trail of dead bodies in its wake in the long run.” Similarly, praising people aggressively (for example, under wrong circumstances) can make them feel underestimated or even ashamed instead of valued.\n\n\nManipulative insincerity\nManipulative insincere guidance is the result of a leader’s desire to be liked and take advantage of it. In this case, both criticism and praise are used to play on other people’s emotions. Even aggressive obnoxious guidance is better—at least, you know what to expect.\n\n\nDestructive empathy\nDestructive empathy occurs when bosses are trying to reduce tension but instead create even more pain, prioritizing friendly communication over improving performance. Ruinously empathetic bosses do not criticize at all – they do not insist on solving issues but rather let them go. Their praise is superficial and feels like flattery, not proved by any serious background.\nRadical candor is different. You can criticize—but only with the noble aim to help see mistakes and correct them. You can praise—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements."

    "text": "Understanding motivation\nTo build an effective team, a leader must recognize the diversity of its members.\nScott (2019) divides workers in two categories—rock stars and superstars.\n\nRock stars are on a gradual growth trajectory:\nThey are happy in their current role and focus on stability.\nTo motivate rock stars, you can give them bonuses or simply say thank you for their work.\nSuper stars are on a steep growth path:\nThey always look for a change and are very ambitious.\nSuper stars get inspired when you constantly challenge them and give them new opportunities.\n\nCohesiveness of a team depends on the contributions of both rock stars and superstars, in a proportion that is relevant to a particular type of work.\nThese labels are not permanent—growth trajectories and goals change constantly, based on work or life events that dictate the amount of work someone can take on. Someone who was once a high performer may reach a point where they are no longer invested in the work and become a low performer, or one of your superstars may have a situation in their home life that slows their growth for the time being. For example, Scott—usually in a superstar role—found herself needing extra time to readjust after the birth of her twins. She asked to be placed in a rock star role for several years, allowing her to spend more time with her family. When she was ready, she jumped back onto her superstar trajectory.\nBecause circumstances are constantly changing, it’s important that you frequently check in with your employees to learn about what’s going on in their lives, talk about their ambitions, and ensure that their growth trajectory suits them. Some recommendations:\n\nSuperstars: Make sure you are offering them challenges and projects that will help them continue to learn.\nRock stars: Make sure you are offering them what they need to feel appreciated and continue doing consistent strong work.\nMediocre: Think of what you can offer them to give them a boost, such as classes or projects, or consider if they’d do better elsewhere.\nLow performance with expected rapid growth: Think of what you can offer them in terms of clearer guidelines, better training, or a transfer to a role they are better suited for."

    "section": "Principles",
    "text": "Principles\nScott (2019) offers some guiding principles to help you commit to radical candor and to best set up your employees for sincere feedback:\n\n\nFocus #1: Humility—your goal is shared understanding\nFocus #2: Helpfulness—you are doing this to help\nFocus #3: Immediacy—in the moment, or shortly thereafter\nFocus #4: In-person—not via text\nFocus #5: Public praise, private criticism\nFocus #6: Caring personally does not mean personalizing\n\n\n\n\nHumility\nHumility is important in both criticism and praise. Criticism without humility can make people feel defensive, and praise without humility can sound insincere or arrogant. There are three concepts on which humble leadership should be based:\n\nPrecise framing of your feedback: When you are giving feedback, frame it around three things—the situation, the person’s behavior, and the outcome. This helps you avoid arrogant generalizations about the person, both in criticism and praise.\nAn effective filter: After feedback that didn’t go well, write down what was actually said in the conversation and what you were thinking during the conversation—this helps you to figure out where the conversation went wrong.\nSeparation of reality and experience: Remember that your experience or subjective observation of a situation is not necessarily the objective truth—this will help you invite challenge as much as you hand it out. Give people the opportunity to tell you about their reality.\n\n\n\nHelpfulness\nRadically candid feedback does the heavy lifting by clarifying what the problem is, so your employee can find the solution more quickly—this is accomplished through three helpful actions:\n\nMaking your intentions clear. Criticism usually prompts defensive reactions. When you state that your intent is to help, not to be hurtful, your employees become more receptive to your feedback.\nBeing as precise as possible. It’s tempting to give vague criticism so you don’t have to dive into the discomfort of fully discussing a tough situation. Precision about what’s good or bad about someone’s behavior clearly demonstrates what they should do more or less of.\nOutsourcing help when possible. Helping each of your team members personally with their issues would be impossibly time-consuming. Instead, look for external help to offer to your employees when appropriate and available.\n\n\n\nImmediacy\nFeedback is most effective when it comes immediately after a situation that deserves attention. It is not a good idea to save feedback for meetings for several reasons:\n\nYou run the risk of forgetting the very thing you wanted to talk about or the specifics of a situation.\nYou’ll often find that problems are too far in the past to be fixed, or that successes are too far in the past to build on.\n\nConsistent feedback allows employees to understand and contextualize how their work is perceived or used. Without the context that comes with praise or criticism, employees feel that their work is not noticed or appreciated and become unmotivated and bored with their work.\nMake sure your schedule allows for post-meeting feedback by stopping meetings 5 minutes before schedule, or by scheduling meetings a minimum of 15 minutes apart. Good feedback doesn’t need to take a long time—the best feedback is consistent and specific.\n\n\nIn-Person\nIt’s best to deliver your feedback in person—you can see how your feedback is being received by theother person, and you avoid misunderstandings that can come from the nuances of written communication.\n\n\nPublic praise, private criticism\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should always default to giving praise in public and criticism in private.\n\nPublic praise tends to be more meaningful for the recipient and demonstrates what your team should do more of.\nPublic criticism tends to trigger defensiveness.\n\n\n\nCaring personally does not mean personalizing\nWhen giving criticism, make sure that you are criticizing the problem or the idea, rather than the person. Attributing a character trait to someone as an explanation for their behavior doesn’t get to the root of the problem.\nIf your criticism starts with “you are,” rethink it."

This makes me feel like you weren’t hearing me and won’t go to the speech coach I’m recommending, which would be a shame because if you stop saying ‘um’ so much, you’ll be more effective (R).

Think about how much time a given feedback conversation is likely to take if it goes well—and if it goes poorly.\nPhysical location. Choose a location that suits the needs of the conversation, ensures sufficient privacy, and minimizes interruptions and distractions.\nProximity. Think about the optimal proxiomity between you and the other person at that moment (e.g., authority vs. strong connection)\n\n\nConcentrate on the message, you want to convey. Focus on facts, not assumptions. I recommend to consider the CORe method. Either way, take enough time to prepare your message.\nManage emotions. Express just enough emotion to engage the other person but not so much that you provoke a hostile ore defensive reaction, shut down the conversation, or damage the relationship.\nPractice and repeat. As with any skill you’re trying to master, experiment in low-risk situations before jumping into a high-stakes feedback conversation."

To counteract this instinct, you should fully examine the feedback so that you can properly decipher the “truth” of the feedback.\n\nFeedback has two elements\nFeedback usually has two parts: a “looking back” part (“This is what I noticed”) and a “looking forward” part (“This is what you should do”). The “looking back” part consists of observations and interpretations of those observations—how a person feels about them. The forward-looking part of the feedback is about next steps: advice, consequences, and expectations.\nTo find common ground, recognize that different people have different “truths.” Your views of another person are subjective, your interpretations are not necessarily more correct than other people’s, and your assessment of how to fix problems may vary.\n\n\nControlling the truth triggers\nUnderstanding feedback requires examining not only the other person’s thoughts and feelings, but also your own. There are two key strategies: finding your own blind spots and looking for differences rather than “wrongs.”\n\nFind your blind spots and referrals\nA “blind spot” is something that we ignore or give little importance to, but that other people see clearly. When other people give us feedback on a trait we are blind to, we dismiss it as untrue. Recognizing our blind spots can prevent this from happening. There are two main categories of blind spots:\n\nBehavioral patterns: a person often engages in behavioral patterns that they themselves are not aware of, but that others around them clearly see.\nYour “tells”: your face, voice, and other nonverbal behaviors can reveal your true thoughts and emotions.\n\nThese are amplified by:\n\nEmotional bias: we discount our emotions, while others count them double.\nAttribution: we attribute our failure to the situation, while others attribute it to the character.\nImpact-intent gap: we judge ourselves by our intentions, while others judge us by our impact on them.\n\n\n\nLook for differences and rights, not wrongs\nInstead of wondering why the feedback is wrong, acknowledge that you and the other person see things differently and try to figure out why. When you master difference-spotting in this way, you will be able to better understand the other person’s views and move from “No, that is wrong” to “Tell me more” (Stone and Heen 2014).\nFinally, ask yourself what is right about the other person’s feedback. Figure out what is meaningful about the feedback, what might be worth trying, and how you can make sense of it that might be helpful (Stone and Heen 2014)."

Also try to step back to see the whole system22 E.g., Are there differences in opinion, values, and habits, roles clashes as well as processes, policies or other players that reinforce the problem?\n\n\n\n\nWe can manage these relationship triggers by disentangling our reaction to the feedback from our reaction to the person giving it. There are two primary relationship triggers (Stone and Heen 2014):\n\nOur opinion of them: When receiving feedback, we are often quick to look for something that disqualifies the person from giving it (skill or judgment; credibility; and trustworthiness of the giver)\nTheir treatment of us: Our perception of how the other person treats us often determines whether or not we accept or ignore their feedback.\n\nThere are three general relationship elements that commonly affect us:\n\nSwitchtracking\nOften when we are relationship-triggered, we “switchtrack”: We respond to a piece of feedback with a reciprocal piece of feedback that is usually aimed at the person raising the issue rather than the issue itself. The conversation splits and starts following two entirely different tracks. For example, if your roommate tells you she’s tired of you not cleaning up the kitchen, and you respond, “Why are you always so critical of me?”, you have just switchtracked the conversation. When we don’t realize we are dealing with two separate topics, we end up talking over one another instead of resolving problems (Stone and Heen 2014).\n\n\nControlling relationship triggers\nControl your relationship triggers by properly managing switchtracking and then stepping back to see the whole system. The goal in controlling a relationship trigger is to recognize when you have two topics on the table, and address each properly.\n\nSpot the two topics: Be alert for conversations where one person raises an issue and the second person responds with a statement or question that focuses on the first person herself, instead of the content of the issue.\nDiscuss the two topics: Give each topic its own track by acknowledging that you are now talking about two different things. Then, decide with the other person which topic to discuss first.\nWatch for additional triggers: Just because you have identified two separate topics doesn’t mean you are out of the woods. Be alert for ambiguities that might hint at deeper issues lurking below, and address them explicitly.\n\nSometimes, we are too close to a situation to see it clearly. Viewing your conflict as part of a system can help you get a fuller understanding of how and why you might be clashing with someone else. Using a systems-focused lens will allow you to take control of the influences around you instead of being controlled by them."

(Stone and Heen 2014) proposes to\n\nbe prepared, be mindful: be aware of your reactions in the moment—slow down when you feel yourself getting emotional;\nseparate your emotions from the story: name your feelings explicitly so that you can judge how they are affecting your interpretation of the feedback;\ncontain the story: change your point of view, imagine you are an observer of your own situation, or imagine how you’ll see it five years from now. Try to see the humor in it that you’ll probably see one day in the future; and to\naccept the limits of your control: accept the fact that you can’t control how others feel about you. If you still can’t get a handle on your emotional reactions to feedback despite your best efforts, seek help from friends, family, or professionals.\n\nIn addition, adopt a growth mindset and approaching your emotional reactions thoughtfully.\nA person with a growth mindset sees her traits as evolving.\n\nShe views feedback as commentary on her actions rather than her identity (“Last week I nailed my sales pitch; this week I dropped the ball”)\nShe sees setbacks as opportunities for learning. A person with a fixed mindset sees her abilities as stable and finished\nShe views feedback as a commentary on her person (“Last week I was great, this week I’m a failure”)\nShe sees setbacks as permanent failures.\n\nTo adopt a growth mindset, consider following guidelines as proposed by Stone and Heen (2014):\n\nListen for coaching rather than evaluation: Coaching doesn’t hint at who you are; it relates to what you do, so it’s easier to take.\nSeparate judgment from evaluation: Focus on the assessment and consequences piece of an evaluation you receive; don’t fixate on how you think this reflects on you in the other person’s eyes.\nGive yourself a “shadow score”: Rate yourself on how well you handle the evaluation from the other person. Recognizing when you handle bad feedback well will help you bounce back from it sooner."

There are several ways to accomplish this:\n\nCreate silence: count to six after asking for criticism. Your employee may be more uncomfortable with silence than with criticizing you, and will say what’s on their mind to fill the space.\nKeep asking: Keep insisting that they come up with something.\nNotice body language: If someone says they have no criticism, but their body language clearly says otherwise, bring it to their attention.\n\n\n\nManage your response\nWhen someone offers you criticism, it’s crucial that you respond in a way that shows that their criticism iswelcome and well-received—this is where trust is built.\n\nDon’t tell them how their criticism is wrong or not radically candid.\nBe careful not to become angry or defensive in response to what they are saying.\nListen with the intent to clarify and fullyunderstand the criticism.\nRepeat what’s been said and checking that your interpretation is correct.\n\n\n\nDemonstrate your gratitude\nShowing your gratitude for criticism encourages people to keep giving it. The best way to show gratitude for criticism is responding with demonstrated change.\n\nIf it’s a change that can be done right away, do so.\nIf it’s a change that can’t be accomplished right away, make a perceptible effort toward the change\n\nIt’s important to express gratitude for criticism even when you think it’s unfair, or don’t agree. Arguing with or dismissing criticism you disagree with will only serve to undermine the trust you are trying to build, so instead focus on ways to work through it.\nSteps you should take, if you do not agree:\n\nFind something in the criticism that you can agree with\nMake sure you fully understand what the other person is expressing\nTell them you’d like to think about it and get back to them.\nIn your follow-up, explain clearly why you disagree, or why making a change won’t be possible.\n\nOnce you get the ball rolling and your employees are gaining confidence in giving you guidance, you need to start giving them guidance in return."

    "text": "Sparkle collaboration\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The getting stuff done wheel (Scott 2019)\n\n\n\nA key goal of a radically candid workplace is to build a highly collaborative climate and a team that works together to accomplish much more than anyone could individually (Scott 2019). The principle of personal caring is particularly important to a collaborative atmosphere for several reasons. First, it allows you to shift perspectives, that is, to incorporate someone else’s way of thinking or acting into your own way of thinking or acting. Second, caring interrupts the self-serving mindset of focusing only on results.\nCollaboration is a lengthy process that should involve every team member who is affected by the results. According to the get stuff done wheel (Scott 2019), there are seven steps to effective collaboration: listen, clarify, discuss, decide, persuade, execute, and learn. You should move through the steps quickly so that collaboration is perceived as a rewarding task rather than a chore, but not skip any step—the success of each step builds on the success of the previous one.\n\nListen\nYour job as a leader is to listen to every person on your team, with the goal of amplifying their voice.\nYou can apply quiet listening by inserting silence in your conversations in order to create space for the other person to speak. To be an effective quiet listener, focus on building conversations that make everyone feel comfortable. But be aware that people may waste their time trying to guess what you want, or present their own ideas as yours in meetings or conversations.\nLoud listening, in contrast, is about saying things that will cause the other person to react or counter—this usually happens when you express a firm opinion and ask for a response. The advantage of this method is that no one wastes time trying to figure out what you think - it is very clear. Besides, this way you quickly get to the bottom of opposing points of view and logic holes. You can encourage the confidence to challenge by stating your idea clearly, and then explicitly asking that the other person challenges your idea.\n\n\nClarify\nGood thinking often needs clarification. It can be provided by brainstorming, when you quickly differentiate between good and bad ideas, or a 1:1 conversation, when you discuss the details without any judgment in a friendly environment.\nIt’s also crucial to remind you an your team that when presenting an idea, it’s the presenters responsibility to make sure everyone understands—not the other way around.\n\n\nDebate\nIt must be a discussion where “individual egos and self-interest don’t get in the way of an objective quest for the best answer.” Debates take time and emotional energy, but are very productive.\n\nMake sure ego doesn’t get in the way of good ideas. Set clear rules before debates, such as no interruptions or no criticism without an idea of your own. Reject anyone who puts forth an idea as “theirs” instead of involving the whole team, or who uses the opinions of absent people to support their opinions.\nExpect disagreement. A good debate doesn’t happen when everyone at the table agrees - make it clear that you expect someone to look at the issue from a different perspective.\nIt is your job to know your team members well enough to recognize when they’re approaching that point, pause the debate, and decide when to resume it.\nKnow your audience. Realize that there may be team members who don’t like debates. Make the goals and expectations of the debate clear from the beginning to reduce discomfort with the debate.\nSet a deadline for your decision** Everyone must have the same expectations for when a decision will be made.\nDon’t make a decision just to end the debate. Don’t take work away from your team by making quick decisions.\n\n\n\nDeciding\nWhen it comes time to make a decision, make sure the right people are the decision-makers. Keep in mind that the most senior people—and you, as the boss—are often considered decision-makers, but they are not necessarily the people with the best information. Your decision-makers should be those who are close to the facts surrounding a situation, and thus have the best possible information to make a decision.\n\n\nPersuading\nIt might feel pointless to put effort into persuading people to go along with a decision once you have already made it, but it’s critical that everyone who will be helping you execute the decision is persuaded of its value—skipping this step leaves key people feeling unimportant and disconnected. Moreover, it is not enough to explain the mere logic: you will have to appeal to people’s emotions, as well as focus on your past accomplishments.\n\n\nExecuting\nDo not get far away from the people executing the task. Be a part of the team.\n\n\nLearn\nIt takes a huge amount of discipline to take a pause and step back to actually learn from your experience. However, it’s crucial to examine results and note the ways that the collaborative process could have gone more smoothly or been improved, because this is where growth happens."

Kim Scott1 even states that relationship maintenance should be a top priority when you move into a leadership position. She advises leaders in radical candid communication (Scott 2019)—straightforward and humanizing management, following the principles outlined below\nCaring personally\nCaring personally means caring about people for more than just their jobs. As a leader, you need to care about them on a personal level. This includes learning more about them as a person—their interests, motivations, and ambitions—and learning more about their “whole self”—who they are outside of work and how their personal life might impact their needs at work.\nWhen you show that you care personally about your employees, their trust in you grows. This has far-reaching implications: When your employees trust you and feel that you have their best interests at heart, they will be honest with you, more receptive to your feedback, and more confident in your decisions. Likewise, you will find that you can be more honest with them and have more confidence in their decisions.\nWe often fail to care personally. One reason is that work culture encourages us to stay professional and hide our feelings. Another one, less virtuous, is a tendency to become arrogant once you find yourself in a boss chair.\nChallenging directly\nChallenging directly means having difficult but necessary conversations with your employees, e.g., conversations where you criticize or disagree with decisions they’ve made. These conversations might feel too difficult, especially if you haven’t had a chance to build a caring, trusting relationship with the person in question. However, you have to let the principle of challenging directly drive you into these discussions for several important reasons.\nFirst, these conversations offer the recipient of the feedback an opportunity to improve and avoid further problems and difficult conversations. Second, by being direct, you show that you care about the person and their improvement enough to put up with the inconvenience of a difficult conversation. This, of course, helps you build a trusting relationship with the person you are talking to.\nIf, on the other hand, you didn’t adhere to the principles of radical openness and avoided the conversation, your employee would continue to fall short - and he would probably know it. If you constantly reassure him that everything is “fine,” it shows that you are not being honest with him when necessary, and that destroys the potential for a trusting relationship."

Praise from a place of radical candor is very specific to the recipient—when you are acting with radical candor, you should be attuned to how your praise is landing with your recipient and be prepared to change it if it’s not quite right.\npraise—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements. Criticism from a place of radical candor is always sincere, and is given both when things go poorly and when things go well.\n\nIf you succeed in two of the dimensions, your guidance is Radical Candor. But what if you fail, in one of those or in both? To demonstrate that, Scott (2019) draws a coordinate system, where care personally is Y, and challenge directly is X. This way, she comes up with three other types of guidance, analyzing those through the prism of criticism and praise.\nOffensive aggression\nOffensive aggression happens when a boss treats employees without respect, belittling and publicly embarrassing them. Obnoxiously aggressive criticism can be effective but at a very high cost: it “sometimes gets great results short-term but leaves a trail of dead bodies in its wake in the long run.” Similarly, praising people aggressively (for example, under wrong circumstances) can make them feel underestimated or even ashamed instead of valued.\nManipulative insincerity\nManipulative insincere guidance is the result of a leader’s desire to be liked and take advantage of it. In this case, both criticism and praise are used to play on other people’s emotions. Even aggressive obnoxious guidance is better—at least, you know what to expect.\nDestructive empathy\nDestructive empathy occurs when bosses are trying to reduce tension but instead create even more pain, prioritizing friendly communication over improving performance. Ruinously empathetic bosses do not criticize at all – they do not insist on solving issues but rather let them go. Their praise is superficial and feels like flattery, not proved by any serious background.\nRadical candor is different. You can criticize—but only with the noble aim to help see mistakes and correct them. You can praise—but make it contextualized and specific, so people know you did notice their achievements."

    "text": "Principles\nScott (2019) offers some guiding principles to help you commit to radical candor and to best set up your employees for sincere feedback:\n\n\nFocus #1: Humility—your goal is shared understanding\nFocus #2: Helpfulness—you are doing this to help\nFocus #3: Immediacy—in the moment, or shortly thereafter\nFocus #4: In-person—not via text\nFocus #5: Public praise, private criticism\nFocus #6: Caring personally does not mean personalizing\n\n\n\nHumility\nHumility is important in both criticism and praise. Criticism without humility can make people feel defensive, and praise without humility can sound insincere or arrogant. There are three concepts on which humble leadership should be based:\n\nPrecise framing of your feedback: When you are giving feedback, frame it around three things—the situation, the person’s behavior, and the outcome. This helps you avoid arrogant generalizations about the person, both in criticism and praise.\nAn effective filter: After feedback that didn’t go well, write down what was actually said in the conversation and what you were thinking during the conversation—this helps you to figure out where the conversation went wrong.\nSeparation of reality and experience: Remember that your experience or subjective observation of a situation is not necessarily the objective truth—this will help you invite challenge as much as you hand it out. Give people the opportunity to tell you about their reality.\n\nHelpfulness\nRadically candid feedback does the heavy lifting by clarifying what the problem is, so your employee can find the solution more quickly—this is accomplished through three helpful actions:\n\nMaking your intentions clear. Criticism usually prompts defensive reactions. When you state that your intent is to help, not to be hurtful, your employees become more receptive to your feedback.\nBeing as precise as possible. It’s tempting to give vague criticism so you don’t have to dive into the discomfort of fully discussing a tough situation. Precision about what’s good or bad about someone’s behavior clearly demonstrates what they should do more or less of.\nOutsourcing help when possible. Helping each of your team members personally with their issues would be impossibly time-consuming. Instead, look for external help to offer to your employees when appropriate and available.\n\nImmediacy\nFeedback is most effective when it comes immediately after a situation that deserves attention. It is not a good idea to save feedback for meetings for several reasons:\n\nYou run the risk of forgetting the very thing you wanted to talk about or the specifics of a situation.\nYou’ll often find that problems are too far in the past to be fixed, or that successes are too far in the past to build on.\n\nConsistent feedback allows employees to understand and contextualize how their work is perceived or used. Without the context that comes with praise or criticism, employees feel that their work is not noticed or appreciated and become unmotivated and bored with their work.\nMake sure your schedule allows for post-meeting feedback by stopping meetings 5 minutes before schedule, or by scheduling meetings a minimum of 15 minutes apart. Good feedback doesn’t need to take a long time—the best feedback is consistent and specific.\nIn-Person\nIt’s best to deliver your feedback in person—you can see how your feedback is being received by theother person, and you avoid misunderstandings that can come from the nuances of written communication.\nPublic praise, private criticism\nAs a general rule of thumb, you should always default to giving praise in public and criticism in private.\n\nPublic praise tends to be more meaningful for the recipient and demonstrates what your team should do more of.\nPublic criticism tends to trigger defensiveness.\n\nCaring personally does not mean personalizing\nWhen giving criticism, make sure that you are criticizing the problem or the idea, rather than the person. Attributing a character trait to someone as an explanation for their behavior doesn’t get to the root of the problem.\nIf your criticism starts with “you are,” rethink it."

This makes me feel like you weren’t hearing me and won’t go to the speech coach I’m recommending, which would be a shame because if you stop saying ‘um’ so much, you’ll be more effective (R). Go to the damn speech coach (E)!”"

However, following things should be considered any way (’HBR’ 2016):\n\nConsider the logistics when you prepare for feedback discussions. It is easy to take our surroundings for granted, but they have a big impact on any interaction. Paying attention to details like these will help make conversations more productive.\n\n\nTimimg. Choose a time when you and the other person will both at your best, e.g., at the beginning of the day.\nDuration. Think about how much time a given feedback conversation is likely to take if it goes well—and if it goes poorly.\nPhysical location. Choose a location that suits the needs of the conversation, ensures sufficient privacy, and minimizes interruptions and distractions.\nProximity. Think about the optimal proxiomity between you and the other person at that moment (e.g., authority vs. strong connection)\n\n\nConcentrate on the message, you want to convey. Focus on facts, not assumptions. I recommend to consider the CORe method. Either way, take enough time to prepare your message.\nManage emotions. Express just enough emotion to engage the other person but not so much that you provoke a hostile ore defensive reaction, shut down the conversation, or damage the relationship.\nPractice and repeat. As with any skill you’re trying to master, experiment in low-risk situations before jumping into a high-stakes feedback conversation."

Managers also use positive feedback to overcome resistance to requests—positive feedback creates a sense of obligation, a social dept. Don’t use feedback to get what you want.\nWe praise the wrong things. Praising intelligence, talent, and abilities backfires. It often causes people to stick to their comfort zones and get really defensive when they hit setbacks. Praise effort, not ability."

By understanding what triggers you and how your own wiring affects your reactions, you can gain control over them.\n“Triggers” are instinctive and usually negative knee-jerk responses that cause us to dismiss feedback or get angry about it. Triggers fall into three general categories (Stone and Heen 2014):\n\nTruth triggers\n—emotional responses to feedback we feel is wrong, unhelpful, or unfair.\nRelationship triggers\n—emotional responses to the person giving the feedback more than the content of the feedback itself.\nIdentity triggers\n—emotional responses to feedback that threatens our sense of who we are."

    "text": "Truth triggers\n\nFeedback is delivered in vague labels, and we are prone to wrong spotting (Stone and Heen 2014). Thus,\n\n\ndiscuss, where it is coming from (data and interpretations)\nand going to (advice, consequences, expectations);\nask, what is different about the data we are looking and our interpretations; and\nask, what is right about the feedback to find out what is legit\nand what concerns you have in common.\n\n\nAlso remember: to see ourselves and our blind spots we need help from others\n\n\nWhen our truth trigger is activated, we reject the content of the feedback and label it as wrong, unhelpful, or unfair. To counteract this instinct, you should fully examine the feedback so that you can properly decipher the “truth” of the feedback.\nFeedback has two elements\nFeedback usually has two parts: a “looking back” part (“This is what I noticed”) and a “looking forward” part (“This is what you should do”). The “looking back” part consists of observations and interpretations of those observations—how a person feels about them. The forward-looking part of the feedback is about next steps: advice, consequences, and expectations.\nTo find common ground, recognize that different people have different “truths.” Your views of another person are subjective, your interpretations are not necessarily more correct than other people’s, and your assessment of how to fix problems may vary.\nControlling the truth triggers\nUnderstanding feedback requires examining not only the other person’s thoughts and feelings, but also your own. There are two key strategies: finding your own blind spots and looking for differences rather than “wrongs.”\nFind your blind spots and referrals\nA “blind spot” is something that we ignore or give little importance to, but that other people see clearly. When other people give us feedback on a trait we are blind to, we dismiss it as untrue. Recognizing our blind spots can prevent this from happening. There are two main categories of blind spots:\n\nBehavioral patterns: a person often engages in behavioral patterns that they themselves are not aware of, but that others around them clearly see.\nYour “tells”: your face, voice, and other nonverbal behaviors can reveal your true thoughts and emotions.\n\nThese are amplified by:\n\nEmotional bias: we discount our emotions, while others count them double.\nAttribution: we attribute our failure to the situation, while others attribute it to the character.\nImpact-intent gap: we judge ourselves by our intentions, while others judge us by our impact on them.\n\nLook for differences and rights, not wrongs\nInstead of wondering why the feedback is wrong, acknowledge that you and the other person see things differently and try to figure out why. When you master difference-spotting in this way, you will be able to better understand the other person’s views and move from “No, that is wrong” to “Tell me more” (Stone and Heen 2014).\nFinally, ask yourself what is right about the other person’s feedback. Figure out what is meaningful about the feedback, what might be worth trying, and how you can make sense of it that might be helpful (Stone and Heen 2014)."

    "text": "Relationship triggers\nSometimes we react to feedback not because of the content of the feedback itself, but because of who gave it to us: It becomes about the who rather than the what.\n\n\n\nManage switchtracking by spotting the two topics and discussing them separately. Also try to step back to see the whole system2\n\n\n\n\nWe can manage these relationship triggers by disentangling our reaction to the feedback from our reaction to the person giving it. There are two primary relationship triggers (Stone and Heen 2014):\n\nOur opinion of them: When receiving feedback, we are often quick to look for something that disqualifies the person from giving it (skill or judgment; credibility; and trustworthiness of the giver)\nTheir treatment of us: Our perception of how the other person treats us often determines whether or not we accept or ignore their feedback.\n\nThere are three general relationship elements that commonly affect us:\nSwitchtracking\nOften when we are relationship-triggered, we “switchtrack”: We respond to a piece of feedback with a reciprocal piece of feedback that is usually aimed at the person raising the issue rather than the issue itself. The conversation splits and starts following two entirely different tracks. For example, if your roommate tells you she’s tired of you not cleaning up the kitchen, and you respond, “Why are you always so critical of me?”, you have just switchtracked the conversation. When we don’t realize we are dealing with two separate topics, we end up talking over one another instead of resolving problems (Stone and Heen 2014).\nControlling relationship triggers\nControl your relationship triggers by properly managing switchtracking and then stepping back to see the whole system. The goal in controlling a relationship trigger is to recognize when you have two topics on the table, and address each properly.\n\nSpot the two topics: Be alert for conversations where one person raises an issue and the second person responds with a statement or question that focuses on the first person herself, instead of the content of the issue.\nDiscuss the two topics: Give each topic its own track by acknowledging that you are now talking about two different things. Then, decide with the other person which topic to discuss first.\nWatch for additional triggers: Just because you have identified two separate topics doesn’t mean you are out of the woods. Be alert for ambiguities that might hint at deeper issues lurking below, and address them explicitly.\n\nSometimes, we are too close to a situation to see it clearly. Viewing your conflict as part of a system can help you get a fuller understanding of how and why you might be clashing with someone else. Using a systems-focused lens will allow you to take control of the influences around you instead of being controlled by them."

(Stone and Heen 2014) proposes to\n\nbe prepared, be mindful: be aware of your reactions in the moment—slow down when you feel yourself getting emotional;\nseparate your emotions from the story: name your feelings explicitly so that you can judge how they are affecting your interpretation of the feedback;\ncontain the story: change your point of view, imagine you are an observer of your own situation, or imagine how you’ll see it five years from now. Try to see the humor in it that you’ll probably see one day in the future; and to\naccept the limits of your control: accept the fact that you can’t control how others feel about you. If you still can’t get a handle on your emotional reactions to feedback despite your best efforts, seek help from friends, family, or professionals.\n\nIn addition, adopt a growth mindset and approaching your emotional reactions thoughtfully.\nA person with a growth mindset sees her traits as evolving.\n\nShe views feedback as commentary on her actions rather than her identity (“Last week I nailed my sales pitch; this week I dropped the ball”)\nShe sees setbacks as opportunities for learning. A person with a fixed mindset sees her abilities as stable and finished\nShe views feedback as a commentary on her person (“Last week I was great, this week I’m a failure”)\nShe sees setbacks as permanent failures.\n\nTo adopt a growth mindset, consider following guidelines as proposed by Stone and Heen (2014):\n\nListen for coaching rather than evaluation: Coaching doesn’t hint at who you are; it relates to what you do, so it’s easier to take.\nSeparate judgment from evaluation: Focus on the assessment and consequences piece of an evaluation you receive; don’t fixate on how you think this reflects on you in the other person’s eyes.\nGive yourself a “shadow score”: Rate yourself on how well you handle the evaluation from the other person. Recognizing when you handle bad feedback well will help you bounce back from it sooner."

There are several ways to accomplish this:\n\nCreate silence: count to six after asking for criticism. Your employee may be more uncomfortable with silence than with criticizing you, and will say what’s on their mind to fill the space.\nKeep asking: Keep insisting that they come up with something.\nNotice body language: If someone says they have no criticism, but their body language clearly says otherwise, bring it to their attention.\n\nManage your response\nWhen someone offers you criticism, it’s crucial that you respond in a way that shows that their criticism iswelcome and well-received—this is where trust is built.\n\nDon’t tell them how their criticism is wrong or not radically candid.\nBe careful not to become angry or defensive in response to what they are saying.\nListen with the intent to clarify and fullyunderstand the criticism.\nRepeat what’s been said and checking that your interpretation is correct.\n\nDemonstrate your gratitude\nShowing your gratitude for criticism encourages people to keep giving it. The best way to show gratitude for criticism is responding with demonstrated change.\n\nIf it’s a change that can be done right away, do so.\nIf it’s a change that can’t be accomplished right away, make a perceptible effort toward the change\n\nIt’s important to express gratitude for criticism even when you think it’s unfair, or don’t agree. Arguing with or dismissing criticism you disagree with will only serve to undermine the trust you are trying to build, so instead focus on ways to work through it.\nSteps you should take, if you do not agree:\n\nFind something in the criticism that you can agree with\nMake sure you fully understand what the other person is expressing\nTell them you’d like to think about it and get back to them.\nIn your follow-up, explain clearly why you disagree, or why making a change won’t be possible.\n\nOnce you get the ball rolling and your employees are gaining confidence in giving you guidance, you need to start giving them guidance in return."

If you did amazing challenges but only read 1-2 papers in your field, you will not receive a good grade. The same applies if you are only citing blog entries, homepages or books. Make sure that you connect your challenges to scientific, high quality papers.\n\n\nWe will do a short intro how to find them.\n\n\nWe will also ask about findings from these papers, so it is important to truly understand the underlying concepts."

How will individual employees and outcomes be evaluated? Will failure harm motivation and self-efficacy?\nProvide skills and training to enable employees to reach goals. Avoid harsh punishment for failure to reach a goal.\n\n\nWho sets the goals?\nPeople will become more committed to goals they help to set. At the same time, people may be tempted to set easy-to-reach goals.\nAllow transparency in the goal-setting process and involve more than one person or unit.\n\n\nIs the time horizon appropriate?\nShort-term goals may harm long-term performance.\nBe sure that short-term efforts to reach a goal do not harm investment in long-term outcomes.\n\n\nHow might goals influence risk taking?\nUnmet goals may induce risk taking.\nBe sure to articulate acceptable levels of risk.\n\n\nHow might goals motivate unethical behavior?\nGoals narrow focus. Employees with goals are less likely to recognize ethical issues, and more likely to rationalize their unethical behavior.\nMultiple safeguards may be necessary to ensure ethical behavior while attaining goals (e.g., leaders as exemplars of ethical behavior, making the costs of cheating far greater than the benefit, strong oversight).\n\n\nCan goals be idiosyncratically tailored for individual abilities and circumstances while preserving fairness?\nIndividual differences may make standardized goals inappropriate, yet unequal goals may be unfair.\nIf possible, strive to set goals that use common standards and account for individual variation.\n\n\nHow will goals influence organizational culture?\nIndividual goals may harm cooperation and corrode organizational culture.\nIf cooperation is essential, consider setting team-based rather than individual goals.Think carefully about the values that the specific, challenging goals convey.\n\n\nAre individuals intrinsically motivated?\nGoal setting can harm intrinsic motivation.\nAssess intrinsic motivation and avoid setting goals when intrinsic motivation is high.\n\n\nWhat type of goal (performance or learning) is most appropriate given the ultimate objectives of the organization?\nBy focusing on performance goals, employees may fail to search for better strategies and fail to learn.\nIn complex, changing environments, learning goals may be more effective than performance goals."

At the same time, people may be tempted to set easy-to-reach goals.\nAllow transparency in the goal-setting process and involve more than one person or unit.\n\n\nIs the time horizon appropriate?\nShort-term goals may harm long-term performance.\nBe sure that short-term efforts to reach a goal do not harm investment in long-term outcomes.\n\n\nHow might goals influence risk taking?\nUnmet goals may induce risk taking.\nBe sure to articulate acceptable levels of risk.\n\n\nHow might goals motivate unethical behavior?\nGoals narrow focus. Employees with goals are less likely to recognize ethical issues, and more likely to rationalize their unethical behavior.\nMultiple safeguards may be necessary to ensure ethical behavior while attaining goals (e.g., leaders as exemplars of ethical behavior, making the costs of cheating far greater than the benefit, strong oversight).\n\n\nCan goals be idiosyncratically tailored for individual abilities and circumstances while preserving fairness?\nIndividual differences may make standardized goals inappropriate, yet unequal goals may be unfair.\nIf possible, strive to set goals that use common standards and account for individual variation.\n\n\nHow will goals influence organizational culture?\nIndividual goals may harm cooperation and corrode organizational culture.\nIf cooperation is essential, consider setting team-based rather than individual goals.Think carefully about the values that the specific, challenging goals convey.\n\n\nAre individuals intrinsically motivated?\nGoal setting can harm intrinsic motivation.\nAssess intrinsic motivation and avoid setting goals when intrinsic motivation is high.\n\n\nWhat type of goal (performance or learning) is most appropriate given the ultimate objectives of the organization?\nBy focusing on performance goals, employees may fail to search for better strategies and fail to learn.\nIn complex, changing environments, learning goals may be more effective than performance goals."

Alle Studierenden, die das selbe Thema gewählt haben, bilden eine Gruppe und arbeiten gemeinsam an einer Präsentation. Sind alle Themen vollständig vergeben, können ausgewählte Themen auch von bis zu 4 Studierenden bearbeitet werden. Die Vergab erfolgt dann durch den Dozenten.\nSie organisieren sich in den Gruppen selbst und tragen Sorge dafür, dass jedes Gruppenmitglied gleich zur Prüfungsleistung beiträgt.\nDie Kurzpräsentation muss zwischen 6 und maximal 8 Minuten lang sein.\nDie Vorbereitungszeit beträgt ca. 2,5 Wochen. Sie können maximal 25 Punkte erzielen.\nDas Video muss nicht geschnitten sein.

Hier fallen während des Lebenszyklus die höchsten Systemkosten an.\nEinführung: Wird eine freiwillige Nutzung unterstellt, ist diese im Idealfall zunehmend. Die Nutzungsintensität wird auch vom Auftreten und Beseitigen von Fehlern während der Installationstests und zu Beginn des produktiven Betriebs bestimmt.\nWachstum: In dieser Phase sind alle Tests abgeschlossen und alle während der Einführung aufgetretenen Fehler beseitigt. Alle Funktionen der Anwendung können produktiv genutzt werden. Es kommt idealerweise zu einem weiteren Anstieg der Nutzung, sofern es sich nicht um eine Anwendung mit beschränktem Benutzerkreis handelt.\nSättigung/Reife: In dieser Phase erreicht die Nutzung ihren Höhepunkt. Bisherige Nutzer können keine weiteren Nutzungsmöglichkeiten entdecken und weitere Nutzer kommen nicht mehr hinzu. Ein Nutzungsrückgang kann dadurch verursacht werden, dass das System nicht mehr dem Stand der Technik entspricht, mit anderen, zeitlich nachgelagert eingeführten, Systemen konkurriert oder die Menge und Bedeutung der unterstützten Aufgaben zurückgeht.\nRückgang: Der in der Phase Sättigung/Reife einsetzende Nutzungsrückgang setzt sich fort.\nAbschaffung: In dieser Phase wird die Entscheidung getroffen, zu welchem Zeitpunkt ein System abgeschafft oder durch ein neues System abgelöst wird. Über den Zeitpunkt der Nutzung hinaus kann das auslaufende System noch Umstellungskosten oder auch remanente Lizenzkosten verursachen."

Zum Beispiel der Organisation und Kontrolle von Informationsflüssen innerhalb eines Unternehmens.\n\n\nDas Informationsmanagement hat insbesondere zum Ziel, sicherzustellen, dass die benötigten Informationen zur richtigen Zeit in der richtigen Qualität und in der richtigen Menge am richtigen Ort sind.\n\nDie zielgerichtete Bereitstellung von Informationen wird auch als Informationslogistik bezeichnet.\n\nDie zentrale Bedeutung der Informationslogistik kann am Beispiel des Investors verdeutlicht werden. Wenn der Investor entweder a) einen falschen Verlauf des Aktienkurses (falsche Qualität) oder b) den richtigen Verlauf erst am Tag darauf (falsche Zeit) oder c) den richtigen Verlauf zur richtigen Zeit an eine falsche Adresse zugesandt bekommt, dann ist die Information für ihn im schlechtesten Fall ohne Wert (Leimeister 2021, p. 28).\n\nIm Rahmen des Informationsmanagements müssen\n\nAngebot, Nachfrage und Verwendung von Information gestaltet,\nSysteme, die Daten produzieren, beschaffen, verteilen und verarbeiten (Informationssysteme) sowie\ndie zugehörige Technik (Informationstechnologie) gesteuert werden."

Acceptance rates are low; only about 10% of papers submitted to most journals are accepted.

    "text": "Structure\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example: A partial search tree for finding a route from Arad to Bucharest; based on Russel and Norvig (2022)\n\n\n\nFigure 2 visualizes a partial search tree: the first few steps in finding a path from Arad (initial state) to Bucharest (goal).\n\nThe root node of the search tree is the initial state \\(s\\) (Arad)\nThe available actions considerd using \\(ACTIONS(s)\\)\nNew nodes, called child nodes or successor nodes are generated using \\(RESULT(s,a)\\) (i.e., the root node is expanded)\nEach child node has Arad as its parent node\nThe child node to be considered next is selected by the minimum value of some evaluation function \\(f(n)\\) (strategies see below)\n\nIn Figure 2, nodes that have been expanded are white with bold letters; nodes on the frontier that have been generated but not yet expanded are in white and regular letters; the set of states corresponding to these two types of nodes are said to have been reached. Nodes that could be generated next are shown in faint dashed lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of search trees\n\n\n\nA search tree is a “what if” tree of plans and their outcomes.\n\nThe start state is the root node,\nchildren correspond to successors,\nnodes show states, but correspond to PLANS that achieve those states\n\nThere are lots of repeated structure in the search tree. Thus, for most problems, the whole tree can never be actually built. In practice, both state space graphs and search trees are constructed on demand and as little as possible (Russel and Norvig 2022).\n\n\nSearch algorithms require a data structure to keep track of the search tree. A node in the tree is represented by a data structure with four components (Russel and Norvig 2022, 91):\n\n\\(node.STATE\\): the state to which the node corresponds\n\\(node.PARENT\\): the node in the tree that generated this node\n\\(node.ACTION\\): the action that was applied to the parent’s state to generate this node\n\\(node.PATH-COST\\): the total cost of the path from the initial state to generate this node\n\nFollowing the PARENT pointers back from a node allows to revocer the states and actions along the path to that node. Doing this from a goal node generates the solution.\n\nExample data structure in pseudo code:\nvar searchTree = {\n  node.STATE: \"Bucharest\"\n  node.PARENT: {\n    node.STATE: \"Pitesti\"\n    node.PARENT: {\n      node.STATE: \"Rimmicu Vilcea\"\n      node.PARENT: {\n        node.STATE: \"Sibiu\"\n        node.PARENT: {\n          node.STATE: \"Arad\"\n          node.PARENT: NULL\n          node.ACTION: NULL\n          node.PATH-COST: 0\n        }\n        node.ACTION: \"Arad to Sibiu\"\n        node.PATH-COST: 140\n      }\n      node.ACTION: \"Sibiu to Rimmicu Vilcea\"\n      node.PATH-COST: 220\n    }\n    node.ACTION: \"Rimmicu Vilcea to Pitesti\"\n    node.PATH-COST: 317\n  }\n  node.ACTION: \"Pitesti to Bucharest\"\n  node.PATH-COST: 418\n}\n\nIn addition, a data structure to store the fontier is neded. Usually this is realized using a queue with following functions (Russel and Norvig 2022, 91):\n\n\\(IS-EMPTY(frontier)\\): returns true only if there are no nodes in the frontier\n\\(POP(frontier)\\): removes the top node from the frontier and returns it\n\\(TOP(frontier)\\): returns (but does not remove) the top node from the frontier\n\\(ADD(node,frontier)\\): inserts node into its proper place in the queue"

correctly report failure when there is not?\nCost optimality: Does it find a solution with the lowest : cost-path of all solutions?\nTime complexity: How long does it take to find a solution (e.g., measured in seconds or by the number of states and actions considered)?\nSpace complexity: How much memory is needed to perform the search?"

cost-path of all solutions?\nTime complexity: How long does it take to find a solution (e.g., measured in seconds or by the number of states and actions considered)?\nSpace complexity: How much memory

The problem of reading a bar code is an extremely limited and artificial form of visual interpretation, and it has been carefully designed to be as simple as possible, given the hardware.\nThe problem of determining the relevance of a web page to a query is a problem in natural language understanding, and the techniques are related to those we will discuss later. Search engines also use clustering techniques. Likewise, other functionalities provided by a search engines use intelligent techniques; for instance, the spelling corrector uses a form of data mining based on observing users’ corrections of their own spelling errors. On the other hand, the problem of indexing billions of web pages in a way that allows retrieval in seconds is a problem in database design, not in artificial intelligence.\nTo a limited extent. Voice-activated telephone menus tend to use vocabularies which are very limited – e.g. the digits, “Yes”, and “No” — and within the designers’ control, which greatly simplifies the problem. On the other hand, the programs must deal with an uncontrolled space of all kinds of voices and accents. Modern digital assistants like Siri and the Google Assistant make more use of artificial intelligence techniques, but still have a limited repetoire.\nInternet routing algorithms are borderline. There is something to be said for viewing these as intelligent agents working in cyberspace. The task is sophisticated, the information available is partial, the techniques are heuristic (not guaranteed optimal), and the state of the world is dynamic. All of these are characteristic of intelligent activities. On the other hand, the task is very far from those normally carried out in human cognition. In recent years there have been suggestions to base more core algorithmic work on machine learning."

Anyone who has written a program with an ornery bug knows this, as does anyone who has written a successful machine learning program. So in one sense Samuel “told” the computer “learn to play checkers better than I do, and then play that way,” but in another sense he told the computer “follow this learning algorithm” and it learned to play. So we’re left in the situation where you may or may not consider learning to play checkers to be a sign of intelligence (or you may think that learning to play in the right way requires intelligence, but not in this way), and you may think the intelligence resides in the programmer or in the computer.\n\nSurely animals cannot be intelligent\n—they can do only what their genes tell them.\n\nThe point of this exercise is to notice the parallel with the previous one.

An agent that only senses partial information could be rational, consider an agent whose performance measure is based on its ability to stay completely static in an environment where there are no other agents, such an agent could be perfectly rational even if it did not have any sensors at all. Granted, such an agent would not be very interesting but it would indeed be rational.\n\n\n\nThere exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.\n\nTrue. A pure reflex agent ignores previous percepts, so cannot obtain an optimal state estimate in a partially observable environment. Consider a partially unobservable task environment where the performance measure is based on the agent’s extent of exploration. Now assume that this agent is purely reflex, only responding when it’s world state changes, since its performance measure is to explore but its actions are conditional upon change around it then the agent waits for its state to change but it never will because it is the agent’s entire job is to change its state.\n\n\n\nThere exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.\n\nTrue. Consider an environment that disables all agent’s actuators, rendering them immobile (e.g., an environment with a single state). Regardless of what performance measures these agents possessed they are still judged as rational because they are physically incapable of performing anything.\n\n\n\nEvery agent is rational in an unobservable environment.\n\nFalse. Some actions are stupid—and the agent may know this if it has a model of the environment—even if one cannot perceive the environment state.\n\n\n\nThere is a model-based reflex agent that can remember all of its percepts.\n\nTrue. There could be one, but usually, it keeps the model. A model-based reflex agent is one that uses internal memory and a percept history to create a model of the environment in which it’s operating and make decisions based on that model. The term percept means something that has been observed or detected by the agent. The model-based reflex agent stores the past percepts in its memory and uses them to create a model of the environment. The agent then uses this model to determine which action should be taken in any given situation.\n\n\n\nA perfectly rational poker-playing agent never loses.\n\nFalse. Due to the partially observable, multi-agent, stochastic, sequential, static and discrete nature of poker, even a perfectly rational agent could not possibly win every game unless the agent is completely omniscient, there are too many factors contributing to the complexity of the task environment that are beyond the agent’s scope of influence. Although, these things are true, let us not discount the fact that the agent could be a learning agent and improve its ability to play but it would still probably lose."

There might be a slight influence from “provenance” information (date, authorship, etc.) that may not be directly observable.\nSkin cancer diagnosis can sometimes be done well from an image of the lesion, bot other factors such as patient age, changes in the lesion over time, medical history, and family history can be important.\nDriving is often considered to be observable because we imagine that we are making decisions based on what we see, but (1) velocity and turn signal status of other vehicles can be judged only from multiple image frames, and (2) assessing the intended actions of other vehicles may require accumulating information over an extended period—e.g., to determine if a vehicle is stopped or broken down, driving slowly or looking for an address or a parking spot, turning left or has forgotten to turn off the turn signal. Other vehicles, hedges, fog, and so on can obscure visual access to important aspects of the driving environment.\nTutoring is almost completely unobservable: what matters is the student’s level of understanding, learning style, basic math skills, etc. clues must be gathered over days, weeks, and months.\n\nContinuous: climate engineering &gt; driving &gt; spoken conversation &gt; written conversation.\n\nClimate engineering by aerosol injection is quintessentially continuous: the engineer must decide how much to inject, where, and when, and all of these are continuous quantities.\nThe control actions of driving are mostly continuous (steering, acceleration/ braking) but there are discrete elements (turn signal, headlights). More importantly, the problem is usually handled using discrete high-level actions (change lanes left, take exit, etc.) that have implementations as continuous control problems. This kind of discrete/ continuous hierarchy is very common; playing chess in the physical world is a perfect example.\nSpoken conversation is closer to chess than driving: roughly speaking, we choose the discrete words to say and delegate the saying to continuous motor control routines. Prosody (volume, pitch, and speed variation) is, however, an important continuous element in how we speak that is largely absent from written communication.\n\nStochastic: poker &gt; soccer &gt; driving &gt; sudoku.\n\nIn poker, nearly everything is determined by the fall of the cards, which is entirely stochastic from the viewpoint of the players.\nBoth soccer and driving contain elements that are fairly deterministic, such as the flight of the ball and the response of the engine, and elements that are stochastic, such as tire punctures and the outcomes of tackles. Yet typically one can make reasonably reliable driving plans over many minutes, whereas it is essentially impossible to predict the state of a soccer game one minute into the future. Sudoku, of course, is entirely deterministic.\n\nStatic: tax planning &gt; checkers &gt; chat room &gt; tennis.\n\nWhile no human activity is completely static, given the finite length of our lifetimes, tax planning comes close—the typical “deadline” to get it done is often weeks or months, and the relevant aspects of the environment (life/death, number of offspring, tax law) may change even more slowly.\nIn checkers, the world state doesn’t change until someone moves, but the clock ticks so the problem is semi-dynamic.\nIn the chat room, long delays in replying are unacceptable, so it is a fairly real-time environment, but not nearly as real-time as tennis, where a delay of a split second often makes the difference between winning and losing a point."

    "text": "I2AI_7 E1\nThe first step is to appreciate the variety of knowledge that goes under the heading “language.”\nThe infant must learn to recognize and produce speech, learn vocabulary, learn grammar, learn the semantic and pragmatic interpretation of a speech act, and learn strategies for disambiguation, among other things.\nThe performance elements for this (in humans) and their associated learning mechanisms are obviously very complex and as yet little is known about them.\nA naive model of the learning environment considers just the exchange of speech sounds. In reality, the physical context of each utterance is crucial: a child must see the context in which “watermelon” is uttered in order to learn to associate “watermelon” with watermelons.\nThus, the environment consists not just of other humans but also the physical objects and events about which discourse takes place. Auditory sensors detect speech sounds, while other senses (primarily visual) provide information on the physical context. The relevant effectors are the speech organs and the motor capacities that allow the infant to respond to speech or that elicit verbal feedback.\nThe performance standard could simply be the infant’s general utility function, however that is realized, so that the infant performs reinforcement learning to perform and respond to speech acts so as to improve its well-being—for example, by obtaining food and attention.\nHowever, humans’ built-in capacity for mimicry suggests that the production of sounds similar to those produced by other humans is a goal in itself. The child (once he or she learns to differentiate sounds and learn about pointing or other means of indicating salient objects) is also exposed to examples of supervised learning: an adult says “shoe” or “belly button” while indicating the appropriate object. So sentences produced by adults provide labelled positive examples, and the response of adults to the infant’s speech acts provides further classification feedback.\nMostly, it seems that adults do not correct the child’s speech, so there are very few negative classifications of the child’s attempted sentences. This is significant because early work on language learning, such as the work of Gold (1967) concentrated just on identifying the set of strings that are grammatical, assuming a particular grammatical formalism. If there are only positive examples, then there is nothing to rule out the grammar \\(S \\implies Word\\). Some theorists (notably Chomsky and Fodor) used what they call the “poverty of the stimulus” argument to say that the basic universal grammar of languages must be innate, because otherwise (given the lack of negative examples) there would be no way that a child could learn a language (under the assumptions of language learning as learning a set of grammatical strings). Critics have called this the “poverty of the imagination” argument—I can’t think of a learning mechanism that would work, so it must be innate. Indeed, if we go to probabilistic context free grammars, then it is possible to learn a language without negative examples.\n\nWhat with learning tennis?\nLearning tennis is much simpler than learning to speak. The requisite skills can be divided into movement, playing strokes, and strategy.\nThe environment consists of the court, ball, opponent, and one’s own body. The relevant sensors are the visual system and proprioception (the sense of forces on and position of one’s own body parts). The effectors are the muscles involved in moving to the ball and hitting the stroke.\nThe learning process involves both supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning occurs in acquiring the predictive transition models, e.g., where the opponent will hit the ball, where the ball will land, and what trajectory the ball will have after one’s own stroke (e.g., if I hit a half-volley this way, it goes into the net, but if I hit it that way, it clears the net).\nReinforcement learning occurs when points are won and lost—this is particularly important for strategic aspects of play such as shot placement and positioning (e.g., in 60% of the points where I hit a lob in response to a cross-court shot, I end up losing the point).\nIn the early stages, reinforcement also occurs when a shot succeeds in clearing the net and landing in the opponent’s court. Achieving this small success is itself a sequential process involving many motor control commands, and there is no teacher available to tell the learner’s motor cortex which motor control commands to issue."

AlphaGo was developed by the London-based DeepMind Technologies, an acquired subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. \nAlphaGo use a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to find their moves based on knowledge previously acquired through machine learning, specifically an artificial neural network (a deep learning method) through extensive training, both from human and computer games. A neural network is trained to recognize the best moves and the winning rates of those moves. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, leading to stronger move selection in the next iteration.\n\n\n\n\nIn competitive environments, two or more agents have conflicting goals.\n\nThis gives rise to adversarial search problems.\n\n\nThe AI community is particularly interested in games of a simplified nature (e.g., chess, go, and poker), as in such games\n\n\n\nthe state of a game is easy to represent,\nagents are restricted to a few actions, and\neffects of actions are defined by precise rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe games most commonly studied within AI are deterministic (two-player, turn-taking, fully observable, zero-sum1) (Russel and Norvig 2022, 192).\n\n\nZero-sum means that what is good for one player is just as bad for the other: there is no “win-win” outcome↩︎\n\n\n\nPossible formalization\n\n\nStates: \\(S\\) (start at \\(S_0\\))\nPlayer: \\(\\textrm{TO-MOVE}(s)\\) (defines which player has the move in state \\(s\\))\nActions: \\(\\textrm{ACTIONS}(s)\\) (the set of legal moves in state \\(s\\))\nTransition model: \\(\\textrm{RESULTS}(s,a)\\) (defines the state resulting from action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\))\nTerminal test: \\(\\textrm{IS-TERMINAL}(s)\\) (is true when the game is over2)\nUtility function: \\(\\textrm{UTILITY}(s,p)\\) (defines the final numeric value to player \\(p\\) when the game ends in terminal state \\(s\\))\n\n\n\n\n\nStates where the game has ended are called terminal states↩︎\n\n\n\nThe initial state, \\(\\textrm{ACTIONS}(s)\\), and \\(\\textrm{RESULT}(s,a)\\) define the state space graph, where the vertices are states, the edges are moves and the state might be reached by multiple paths.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers (here MIN and MAX, alternate turns) need to have a conditional plan—a contingent strategy specifying a response to each move of the opponent.\n\n\nFor games with binary outcomes (win or lose), AND-OR3 search tree can be used\n(see Russel and Norvig 2022, 143)\nFor games with multiple outcome scores, the minimax search algorithm is used\n\n\n\n\nThe search tree consists of AND nodes and OR nodes. AND nodes reflect the environment’s choice of action (which all need to be considers), OR nodes the agent’s own choices in each state (where only one needs to be considered). AND and OR nodes alternate. A solution is a conditional plan that considers every nondeterministic outcome and makes a plan for each one.↩︎"

It chooses the action that leads to the best expected utility, where expected utility is computed by averaging over all possible states, weighted by the probability of the outcome (Russel and Norvig 2022, 73).\nThe utility function is essentially an internalization of the performance measure.\nA utility-based agent has many advantages in terms of flexibility and learning, which are particularly helpful in environments characterized by partial observability and nondeterminism.\nIn addition, there are cases where the goals are insufficient but a utility-based agent can still make rational decisions based on the probabilities and the utilities of the outcomes:\n\nWhen there are conflicting goals, the utility function specifies the appropriate tradeoff.\nLikelihood of success (i.e., goal achievement) can be weighed against the importance of the goals\n\nModel- and utility-based agents are difficult to implement. They need to model and keep track of the task environment, which requires ingenious sensors, sophisticated algorithms, and a high computational complexity.\nThere are also utility-based agents that are not model-based. These agents just learn what action is best in a particular situation without any “understanding” of its impact on the environment (e.g., based on reinforcement learning).\n\nMain differences\nThe main difference between simple reflex agents and model-based reflex agents is that the latter keep track of the state of the world. Model-based reflex agents generate knowledge about how the world evolves independently of the agent and how actions of the agent change the world (i.e., they have knowledge about “how the world works”). This knowledge is “stored” in the transition model of the world. A model-based reflex agents still decides on condition-action rules which action to take (i.e., the codified reflexes).\nThe main difference between model-based reflex agents and goal-based agents is that it does not act on fixed condition-action rules, but on some sort of goal information that describes situations that are desirable (e.g., in the case of route-finding the destination). Based on the goal, the best possible action (based on the knowledge of the world), needs to be selected. Goal-based decision making involves consideration of the future based on the transition model (i.e., “what will happen if I do such-and-such?”) and how it helps to achieve the goal. In reflex agents designs, this information I not explicitly represented, because the built rules map directly from the percepts to actions, without considering/knowing the future state.\nThe main difference between goal-based agents and utility-based agents is that the performance measure is more general. It does not only consider a binary distinction between “goal achieved” and “goal not achieved” but allows comparing different world states according to their relative utility or expected utility, respectively (i.e., how happy the agent is with the resulting state). Utility-based agents can still make rational decisions when there are conflicting goals for which only one can be achieved (here the utility function needs to specify a trade-off) and when there are several goals that the agent can aim for, none of which can be achieved with certainty (here the utility function provides a which in which the likelihood of success can be weighed against the importance of the goals, e.g., speed and energy consumption in routing).\nExample: a goal-based agent for routing just selects actions based on a single, binary goal: reaching the destination; a utility-based agents also considers additional goals like spending as less time as possible on the road, spending as less money as possible, having the best scenery on the trip, etc. and tries to maximize overall utility across these goals. In this example, reaching the destiny is the ultimate goal, without achieving that utility would be zero. However, utility will increase or decrease related to how the actions chosen impact the achievement of the other goals, which importance need to be weighed."

It chooses the action that leads to the best expected utility, where expected utility is computed by averaging over all possible states, weighted by the probability of the outcome (Russel and Norvig 2022, 73).\nThe utility function is essentially an internalization of the performance measure.\nA utility-based agent has many advantages in terms of flexibility and learning, which are particularly helpful in environments characterized by partial observability and nondeterminism.\nIn addition, there are cases where the goals are insufficient but a utility-based agent can still make rational decisions based on the probabilities and the utilities of the outcomes:\n\nWhen there are conflicting goals, the utility function specifies the appropriate tradeoff.\nLikelihood of success (i.e., goal achievement) can be weighed against the importance of the goals\n\nModel- and utility-based agents are difficult to implement. They need to model and keep track of the task environment, which requires ingenious sensors, sophisticated algorithms, and a high computational complexity.\nThere are also utility-based agents that are not model-based. These agents just learn what action is best in a particular situation without any “understanding” of its impact on the environment (e.g., based on reinforcement learning).\nMain differences\nThe main difference between simple reflex agents and model-based reflex agents is that the latter keep track of the state of the world. Model-based reflex agents generate knowledge about how the world evolves independently of the agent and how actions of the agent change the world (i.e., they have knowledge about “how the world works”). This knowledge is “stored” in the transition model of the world. A model-based reflex agents still decides on condition-action rules which action to take (i.e., the codified reflexes).\nThe main difference between model-based reflex agents and goal-based agents is that it does not act on fixed condition-action rules, but on some sort of goal information that describes situations that are desirable (e.g., in the case of route-finding the destination). Based on the goal, the best possible action (based on the knowledge of the world), needs to be selected. Goal-based decision making involves consideration of the future based on the transition model (i.e., “what will happen if I do such-and-such?”) and how it helps to achieve the goal. In reflex agents designs, this information I not explicitly represented, because the built rules map directly from the percepts to actions, without considering/knowing the future state.\nThe main difference between goal-based agents and utility-based agents is that the performance measure is more general. It does not only consider a binary distinction between “goal achieved” and “goal not achieved” but allows comparing different world states according to their relative utility or expected utility, respectively (i.e., how happy the agent is with the resulting state). Utility-based agents can still make rational decisions when there are conflicting goals for which only one can be achieved (here the utility function needs to specify a trade-off) and when there are several goals that the agent can aim for, none of which can be achieved with certainty (here the utility function provides a which in which the likelihood of success can be weighed against the importance of the goals, e.g., speed and energy consumption in routing).\nExample: a goal-based agent for routing just selects actions based on a single, binary goal: reaching the destination; a utility-based agents also considers additional goals like spending as less time as possible on the road, spending as less money as possible, having the best scenery on the trip, etc. and tries to maximize overall utility across these goals. In this example, reaching the destiny is the ultimate goal, without achieving that utility would be zero. However, utility will increase or decrease related to how the actions chosen impact the achievement of the other goals, which importance need to be weighed."

Computer, Internetzugang, Software) (Lemke und Brenner 2015).\n\n\nHeute ist Informations- und Kommunikationstechnik in unserem Leben allgegenwärtig und wird zunehmend schwerer wahrnehmbar bzw. vielfach unsichtbar. Technik tritt aufgrund benutzerfreundlicher, integrierter und konvergenter Produkte immer mehr in den Hintergrund. Die IT-Komponenten bzw. die IT-Infrastruktur ist in vielen Produkten kaum noch als solche erkennbar (bspw. smarte Lautsprecher). Zudem werden wesentliche Komponenten der IT-Infrastruktur wie bspw. der Zugang zum Internet über mobile Netze verstärkt als gegebene, verfügbare und zuverlässige Ressourcen betrachtet, um die man sich nicht mehr spezifisch kümmern muss. Dadurch wird die IT-Infrastruktur immer stärker zur “Commodity”, also zur standardisierten und mehr oder weniger homogene Handelswaren wie bspw. Strom, Erdgas, Wärme und Wasser."

    "text": "Information technology is at the core of how you do your business and how your business model itself evolves. Stya Nadella (2016), CEO von Microsoft\n\n\nIn den vergangenen Kapiteln haben wir uns intensiv mit den Grundkonzepten des Informationsmanagements sowie mit Informationssystemen und deren wesentlichen Komponenten, Geschäftsprozessen und Strategien beschäftigt. Wir haben dabei gelernt, dass viele Unternehmen ohne Informationstechnologie und adäquates IT-Management nicht (mehr) funktionsfähig sind. In diesem Kapitel betrachten wir abschließend ein weiteres, zunehmend durch IT beeinflusstes Konzept auf der strategischen Ebene: das Geschäftsmodell."

Der wissenschaftliche Diskurs zeigt jedoch, dass die Strategie und das Geschäftsmodell eines Unternehmens nicht identisch sind, sondern sich voneinander unterscheiden.\nEine Unternehmensstrategie legt langfristige Ziele sowie grundsätzliche Maßnahmen fest, diese zu erreichen. Basis für die langfristige Ausrichtung eines Unternehmens sind sowohl dessen interne Stärken und Schwächen als auch die unternehmensexternen Chancen und Risiken der Umwelt. Die Stärken eines Unternehmens sollen mit den Chancen der Umwelt in Einklang gebracht werden, wobei gleichzeitig die eigenen Schwächen verringert und die externen Risiken vermieden werden sollen. Kurzum: Strategie beschreibt, wie sich ein Unternehmen gegenüber Konkurrenten durchsetzen kann.\nDahingegen beschreibt das Geschäftsmodell auf abstrakter Ebene wie die Unternehmensressourcen so koordiniert werden, so dass Wert geschaffen wird oder in Zukunft geschaffen werden soll. Aus dem Geschäftsmodell lassen sich dann die spezifischen Geschäftsprozesse ableiten. Diese beschreiben im Detail, wie mit Hilfe von Tätigkeitsketten aus verschiedenen Produktionsfaktoren (Input) ein spezifisches Ergebnis (Output) erzeugt wird.\nStrategien unterscheiden sich von Geschäftsmodellen also insbesondere darin, dass Strategien zukunftsorientiert sind und eine langfristige Perspektive verfolgen, wohingegen Geschäftsmodelle eher gegenwartsbezogen sind und die aktuelle Logik zur Erzeugung von Wert beschreiben. Eine Strategie kann zu unterschiedlichen Geschäftsmodellen führen, ein Geschäftsmodell ist deshalb nur eine mögliche Abbildung der Strategie.\nDas Unternehmen, die eine gleiche Strategie verfolgen, diese durch unterschiedliche Geschäftsmodelle umsetzen können zeigt sich unter anderem bei Fluggesellschaften. Fluggesellschaften wie Ryanair und Eurowings verfolgen eine Wettbewerbsstrategie, die als Preisführerschaft bezeichnet wird (low-cost Airlines). Die Unternehmen unterscheiden sich aber in der Art und Weise, wie sie ihr Geschäftsmodell konzipiert haben. Unterschiede lassen sich z.B. hinsichtlich des Partnernetzwerkes (Eurowings ist Teil der Lufthansa Gruppe), des Codesharings, sowie des Kundenservices feststellen."

Hier fallen während des Lebenszyklus die höchsten Systemkosten an.\nEinführung: Wird eine freiwillige Nutzung unterstellt, ist diese im Idealfall zunehmend.

Alle Funktionen der Anwendung können produktiv genutzt werden. Es kommt idealerweise zu einem weiteren Anstieg der Nutzung, sofern es sich nicht um eine Anwendung mit beschränktem Benutzerkreis handelt.\nSättigung/Reife: In dieser Phase erreicht die Nutzung ihren Höhepunkt. Bisherige Nutzer können keine weiteren Nutzungsmöglichkeiten entdecken und weitere Nutzer kommen nicht mehr hinzu. Ein Nutzungsrückgang kann dadurch verursacht werden, dass das System nicht mehr dem Stand der Technik entspricht, mit anderen, zeitlich nachgelagert eingeführten, Systemen konkurriert oder die Menge und Bedeutung der unterstützten Aufgaben zurückgeht.\nRückgang: Der in der Phase Sättigung/Reife einsetzende Nutzungsrückgang setzt sich fort.\nAbschaffung: In dieser Phase wird die Entscheidung getroffen, zu welchem Zeitpunkt ein System abgeschafft oder durch ein neues System abgelöst wird.

Hier fallen während des Lebenszyklus die höchsten Systemkosten an.\nEinführung: Wird eine freiwillige Nutzung unterstellt, ist diese im Idealfall zunehmend. Die Nutzungsintensität wird auch vom Auftreten und Beseitigen von Fehlern während der Installationstests und zu Beginn des produktiven Betriebs bestimmt.\nWachstum: In dieser Phase sind alle Tests abgeschlossen und alle während der Einführung aufgetretenen Fehler beseitigt. Alle Funktionen der Anwendung können produktiv genutzt werden. Es kommt idealerweise zu einem weiteren Anstieg der Nutzung, sofern es sich nicht um eine Anwendung mit beschränktem Benutzerkreis handelt.\nSättigung/Reife: In dieser Phase erreicht die Nutzung ihren Höhepunkt. Bisherige Nutzer können keine weiteren Nutzungsmöglichkeiten entdecken und weitere Nutzer kommen nicht mehr hinzu. Ein Nutzungsrückgang kann dadurch verursacht werden, dass das System nicht mehr dem Stand der Technik entspricht, mit anderen, zeitlich nachgelagert eingeführten, Systemen konkurriert oder die Menge und Bedeutung der unterstützten Aufgaben zurückgeht.\nRückgang: Der in der Phase Sättigung/Reife einsetzende Nutzungsrückgang setzt sich fort.\nAbschaffung: In dieser Phase wird die Entscheidung getroffen, zu welchem Zeitpunkt ein System abgeschafft oder durch ein neues System abgelöst wird. Über den Zeitpunkt der Nutzung hinaus kann das auslaufende System noch Umstellungskosten oder auch remanente Lizenzkosten verursachen."

This is what some people call an unmet need or an aha moment. This is something you can use to bring about change or to address and solve a problem.\nApproach: How does your story unfold?

He identified multiple competing demands and views between members within the organization and across various levels of the organization. He showed that these reflect different values of individuals and often different cultures which had become embedded in parts of and across organizations. Quinn (1988) set out his attempt to develop an integrating framework that could capture these in a meaningful way, with different mixes of paradoxes and contradictions at each point in time, and to show how individuals and organisations could better appreciate the circumstances and move forward.\nQuinn (1988) distilled the competing values in a framework with two dimensions and resulting four quadrants. The dimensions express the tensions or competing values that characterize all organisations. One axis represents the continuum between flexibility or adaptability and stability or control. The other axis describes the continuum between efficient internal processes, such as human resource practices or internal control systems, and external positioning vis-à-vis stakeholders such as competitors, customers and clients. Each continuum highlights performance criteria that are opposite to the other end of the continuum, such as internal versus external alignment (horizontal axis) or flexibility versus stability (vertical axis).\nThe main characteristics of the clan culture, so called because it resembles a family-like orientation, include empowerment, team building and employee participation; the main characteristics of the adhocracy culture include adaptability, creativity and risk-taking; this type of culture is often found in innovative industries. The main characteristics of hierarchy culture include standardisation, predictability and multiple levels of management; the authors suggest that this type of culture is usually found in government agencies. Finally, Cameron and Quinn (2006) suggest that market culture, with its characteristic outward orientation and competitive attitude, is often found in organisations operating in unstable and crowded operating environments.\nThe four orientations are intuitively appealing, perhaps confirming their origin in psychological archetypes; most people can probably find the culture of their current organisation somewhere in this taxonomy. However, as the academic labels for thein each quadrant are often misunderstood, it has proven useful to substitute more accessible and commonly used verbs to describe the dominant activities that relate to each culture—collaborate, create, compete, and control (Lavine 2014).\nThe model further groups two of the leadership roles in each of the four quadrants. The upper right quadrant, which the framework links to open systems theory and the process of adapting to the external environment of the organisation, defines two leadership roles:\n\nThe innovator is creative and surrounds, encourages and facilitates change.\nThe broker is politically astute, acquires resources and maintains the external legitimacy of the entity by building, scanning and maintaining a network of external contacts.\n\nMoving clockwise to the lower right quadrant, two other leadership roles are specified. These roles emphasize the rational pursuit of goals that are external to the group and the role of the leader in defining and motivating the achievement of these goals.\n\nThe producer is the task-oriented, work-driven role. The producer seeks closure and motivates the behaviors that lead to the completion of the group task\nThe director sets goals, clarifies the role, sets targets and formulates clear expectations.\n\nThe lower left quadrant is called the internal process model and focuses on internal control and stability. Two additional leadership roles are defined in this quadrant:\n\nThe coordinator maintains the structure, plans, coordinates and resolves problems, and ensures compliance with rules and standards.\nThe monitor collects and distributes information, reviews performance and ensures continuity and stability.\n\nThe upper left quadrant is referred to in the framework as the human relations quadrant, which focuses on human interaction and process. Within this quadrant, two final leadership roles are defined:\n\nThe facilitator encourages the expression of opinions, seeks consensus and negotiates compromises.\nThe mentor is aware of individual needs, actively listens, is fair, supports legitimate concerns and seeks to promote the development of the individual."

(2020, p. 12)\n\nLeadership qualities seem to be best demonstrated by more movement throughout the framework, suggesting complex adaptation to changing circumstances (Denison, Hooijberg, and Quinn 1995).\nThe CVF provides a description of roles and behaviors to encourage self-reflection and to provide a preliminary sense of behaviors and accompanying roles that can be learned.\nWorking to overcome areas of relative weakness so that they can be transformed into average or adequate performance can help leaders see more opportunities for action when core areas of strength are not delivering the desired results."

    "text": "Complexities (competing values)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The competing values in a framework based on Quinn (1988)\n\n\nThe creator of the competing values framework (CVF), Quinn (1988) argues that top managers and leaders are better able to recognize and deal with contradictions and paradoxes that often manifest themselves in the form of conflict, unconstructive conversations and misalignment of leadership and management capacity with an organisation’s strategic challenges. He identified multiple competing demands and views between members within the organization and across various levels of the organization. He showed that these reflect different values of individuals and often different cultures which had become embedded in parts of and across organizations. Quinn (1988) set out his attempt to develop an integrating framework that could capture these in a meaningful way, with different mixes of paradoxes and contradictions at each point in time, and to show how individuals and organisations could better appreciate the circumstances and move forward.\nQuinn (1988) distilled the competing values in a framework with two dimensions and resulting four quadrants. The dimensions express the tensions or competing values that characterize all organisations. One axis represents the continuum between flexibility or adaptability and stability or control. The other axis describes the continuum between efficient internal processes, such as human resource practices or internal control systems, and external positioning vis-à-vis stakeholders such as competitors, customers and clients. Each continuum highlights performance criteria that are opposite to the other end of the continuum, such as internal versus external alignment (horizontal axis) or flexibility versus stability (vertical axis).\nThe main characteristics of the clan culture, so called because it resembles a family-like orientation, include empowerment, team building and employee participation; the main characteristics of the adhocracy culture include adaptability, creativity and risk-taking; this type of culture is often found in innovative industries. The main characteristics of hierarchy culture include standardisation, predictability and multiple levels of management; the authors suggest that this type of culture is usually found in government agencies. Finally, Cameron and Quinn (2006) suggest that market culture, with its characteristic outward orientation and competitive attitude, is often found in organisations operating in unstable and crowded operating environments.\nThe four orientations are intuitively appealing, perhaps confirming their origin in psychological archetypes; most people can probably find the culture of their current organisation somewhere in this taxonomy. However, as the academic labels for thein each quadrant are often misunderstood, it has proven useful to substitute more accessible and commonly used verbs to describe the dominant activities that relate to each culture—collaborate, create, compete, and control (Lavine 2014).\nThe model further groups two of the leadership roles in each of the four quadrants. The upper right quadrant, which the framework links to open systems theory and the process of adapting to the external environment of the organisation, defines two leadership roles:\n\nThe innovator is creative and surrounds, encourages and facilitates change.\nThe broker is politically astute, acquires resources and maintains the external legitimacy of the entity by building, scanning and maintaining a network of external contacts.\n\nMoving clockwise to the lower right quadrant, two other leadership roles are specified. These roles emphasize the rational pursuit of goals that are external to the group and the role of the leader in defining and motivating the achievement of these goals.\n\nThe producer is the task-oriented, work-driven role. The producer seeks closure and motivates the behaviors that lead to the completion of the group task\nThe director sets goals, clarifies the role, sets targets and formulates clear expectations.\n\nThe lower left quadrant is called the internal process model and focuses on internal control and stability. Two additional leadership roles are defined in this quadrant:\n\nThe coordinator maintains the structure, plans, coordinates and resolves problems, and ensures compliance with rules and standards.\nThe monitor collects and distributes information, reviews performance and ensures continuity and stability.\n\nThe upper left quadrant is referred to in the framework as the human relations quadrant, which focuses on human interaction and process. Within this quadrant, two final leadership roles are defined:\n\nThe facilitator encourages the expression of opinions, seeks consensus and negotiates compromises.\nThe mentor is aware of individual needs, actively listens, is fair, supports legitimate concerns and seeks to promote the development of the individual."

Often organizations need both stability and change at the same time. In contrast to earlier approaches, the development of the competing values framework did not assume that stability and change were mutually exclusive, an either/or decision. Quinn et al. (2020, p. 12)\n\n\nLeadership qualities seem to be best demonstrated by more movement throughout the framework, suggesting complex adaptation to changing circumstances (Denison, Hooijberg, and Quinn 1995).\n\n\nThe CVF provides a description of roles and behaviors to encourage self-reflection and to provide a preliminary sense of behaviors and accompanying roles that can be learned.\n\n\nWorking to overcome areas of relative weakness so that they can be transformed into average or adequate performance can help leaders see more opportunities for action when core areas of strength are not delivering the desired results."

It is about a collective identity.\n\nShared values\n\nTo form a community, members have to agree on what is important. By shaping the group’s priorities and choices, values influence individual and collective thought and action (e.g., bold ambition, collaboration, responsibility, learning)\n\nRules of engagement\n\nThose keep members focused on what is imperative, discourage unproductive behaviors, and encourage activities that foster innovation (e.g., respect, trust, influence, see the whole, question everything, be data driven.\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational capabilities\nWillingness is necessary but not sufficient for innovation to flourish. Companies also need the ability to innovate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to do the hard work of innovation (Linda A. Hill et al. 2014a, 192)\n\n\n\n\nCreative abrasion\n\nThe ability to develop a marketplace where rich diverse ideas compete through discourse and debate.\n\nCreative agility\n\nThe ability to develop and test different options, learn from outcomes and try again and again till the optimal option is evolved.\n\nCreative resolution\n\nThe ability to to make decisions that combine disparate and sometimes even opposing ideas."

    "text": "Motivation\n\nSociety often associates leaders with individuals that have grandiose titles, a large corner office, and make world-changing decisions. Thus, many people shy away from identifying themselves as a leader. However, real leadership can be seen most clearly in the small moments throughout the day.\n\nLeadership is about behaving in a way that makes the life of another person better than before you arrived. Drew Dudley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral remarks\nThis module helps you to deepen your understanding of the requirements of leadership in the digital age — from leading oneself, to leading employees and leading systems.\nTo achieve that, you will read a bunch of scientific papers, apply some of the findings in (group) exercises and, best case, reflect your own behavior.\nAs a graded exam assignment, you will research a theory/theoretical construct related to leadership, explain it to the class, and critically discuss its value to leadership practice.\nIt is very important that you prepare yourself for the classes (see Table 1 for details).\n\n\nContents\nThe following topics will be discussed in order to identify and reflect on challenges and opportunities in different leadership roles and situations:\n\n\nChallenges of leading in the digital age (e.g., VUCA, role of technology, etc.)\nBasics of leadership (e.g., motivation, leadership characteristics, etc.)\nTheories (e.g., resources and demand theory, identities at work, trust, psychological safety, etc.)\nDigital leadership tools (workshop tactics and storytelling, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nDuring this course, you should improve your ability to consciously use, reflect on and further develop your leadership skills in your day-to-day work, in particular with regard to\n\n\nLeadership requirements in the context of digital transformation,\nIdentification of and reflection on challenges and opportunities in your own leadership role,\nUnderstanding of the facets of different personality types,\nBasic understanding of characteristics of sustainable organizational systems, and\nLead hierarchically and laterally using digital leadership tools.\n\n\n\n\nEffort\nYou will gain 5 ECTS for this course. This equals approx. 150 hours workload, of which you need most to pass the course.\n\n\nClasses (approx. 30 hours)\nPreparation and follow-up (approx. 15 hours)\nPreparation of the presentation (remaining time)\n\n\n\nPlease prepare your schedule accordingly.\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\nIt is of importance that you prepare yourself for the sessions and work on the case study continually.

This allows, for instance, human domain experts to deal with so called ‘‘broken-leg’’ predictions that deviate from the currently known probability distribution. However, they are restricted by bound rationality that prevents them from aggregating information perfectly and drawing conclusions from that. On the other hand, machines are particularly good at solving repetitive tasks that require fast processing of huge amounts of data, at recognizing complex patterns, or weighing multiple factors following consistent rules of probability theory (Dellermann et al. 2019).\nHowever, there is also a technology-centric perspective that assumes that true intelligence can ultimately only be found in well-developed and mature (general) AI systems. Humans are biologically limited in their information processing and reasoning abilities and exhibit many types of cognitive biases, while computers offer virtually infinite possibilities to develop rational intelligence at human levels and beyond (Peeters et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel of human cognition\n\n\n\nKahneman (2011) proposed a two-system model of human cognition, which he called System 1 and System 2.\nSystem 1 is an intuitive, automatic, and fast mode of thinking that operates outside of our conscious awareness. It is responsible for generating impressions, making quick judgments, and executing routine tasks with minimal effort.\nSystem 2, on the other hand, is a more analytical, controlled, and deliberate mode of thinking that requires conscious effort and attention. It is responsible for problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making.\nWhile System 1 operates quickly and automatically, it can be prone to biases and errors, particularly in complex or unfamiliar situations. System 2, though slower and more effortful, can help us avoid these biases and make more accurate decisions."

This allows, for instance, human domain experts to deal with so called ‘‘broken-leg’’ predictions that deviate from the currently known probability distribution. However, they are restricted by bound rationality that prevents them from aggregating information perfectly and drawing conclusions from that. On the other hand, machines are particularly good at solving repetitive tasks that require fast processing of huge amounts of data, at recognizing complex patterns, or weighing multiple factors following consistent rules of probability theory (Dellermann et al. 2019).\nHowever, there is also a technology-centric perspective that assumes that true intelligence can ultimately only be found in well-developed and mature (general) AI systems. Humans are biologically limited in their information processing and reasoning abilities and exhibit many types of cognitive biases, while computers offer virtually infinite possibilities to develop rational intelligence at human levels and beyond (Peeters et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel of human cognition\n\n\nKahneman (2011) proposed a two-system model of human cognition, which he called System 1 and System 2.\nSystem 1 is an intuitive, automatic, and fast mode of thinking that operates outside of our conscious awareness. It is responsible for generating impressions, making quick judgments, and executing routine tasks with minimal effort.\nSystem 2, on the other hand, is a more analytical, controlled, and deliberate mode of thinking that requires conscious effort and attention. It is responsible for problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making.\nWhile System 1 operates quickly and automatically, it can be prone to biases and errors, particularly in complex or unfamiliar situations. System 2, though slower and more effortful, can help us avoid these biases and make more accurate decisions."

The TBM model creates the financial, tehcnical, and business views that are meaningful to various decision makers and stakeholders (Tucker and Council 2016).\nThe TBM model is normally built and processed using software (e.g., the TBM solution ApptioOne).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The TBM model (based on Tucker and Council 2016)\n\n\n\n\nFinance view\nThis view begins with the general ledger, but may include other cost sources unique to your organization. The taxonomy provides for a standard set of breakouts (e.g., CapEx vs. OpEx, fixed v-s variable cost) and a standard set of cost pools as in hardware, software, internal labor, external labor facilities/overhead, and outside services.\nCost pools not only make cost allocation easiery, they enhance reporting as they can be traced through teh model to reveal the composition of your costs and allow for comparibility of composition (e.g., how much internal labor is found in this service vs. that one?) (Tucker and Council 2016).\n\n\nIT view\nThis view includes a common set of infrastructure towers and sub-towers, such as servers, storage, voice and data networks, applicaiton development, and support. These towers are in use by nearly all companies and are the basic building blocks of specific appliactions, services, etc. Regardless of where they come from (e.g., internally or via the public cloud), this view enables IT leader to assess how cost-effective IT is in its delivery of technologies and services (Tucker and Council 2016).\n\n\nBusiness view\nThis view provides a standard, generic set of applications and services along with the business capabilities they support. At this layer of the model, the creation of industry-specific elements that will allow for more meaningful reporting and comparison for each vertical is anticipated. This layer also includes the business unit consumers or breakouts (allocations) by consumer (Tucker and Council 2016)."

It includes the TBM taxonomy objects and layers plus the data requirements, *allocation rules, and metrics needed to create transparency** and enable the reporting that is needed to evaluate and communicate cost, quality, and value of IT investments. The TBM model creates the financial, tehcnical, and business views that are meaningful to various decision makers and stakeholders (Tucker and Council 2016).\nThe TBM model is normally built and processed using software (e.g., the TBM solution ApptioOne).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The TBM model (based on Tucker and Council 2016)\n\n\n\nFinance view\nThis view begins with the general ledger, but may include other cost sources unique to your organization. The taxonomy provides for a standard set of breakouts (e.g., CapEx vs. OpEx, fixed v-s variable cost) and a standard set of cost pools as in hardware, software, internal labor, external labor facilities/overhead, and outside services.\nCost pools not only make cost allocation easiery, they enhance reporting as they can be traced through teh model to reveal the composition of your costs and allow for comparibility of composition (e.g., how much internal labor is found in this service vs. that one?) (Tucker and Council 2016).\nIT view\nThis view includes a common set of infrastructure towers and sub-towers, such as servers, storage, voice and data networks, applicaiton development, and support. These towers are in use by nearly all companies and are the basic building blocks of specific appliactions, services, etc. Regardless of where they come from (e.g., internally or via the public cloud), this view enables IT leader to assess how cost-effective IT is in its delivery of technologies and services (Tucker and Council 2016).\nBusiness view\nThis view provides a standard, generic set of applications and services along with the business capabilities they support. At this layer of the model, the creation of industry-specific elements that will allow for more meaningful reporting and comparison for each vertical is anticipated. This layer also includes the business unit consumers or breakouts (allocations) by consumer (Tucker and Council 2016)."

Value reflects a balance between benefits, risk, and resources, and companies need an actionable strategy and governance system to realize that value.\nA governance system for information and technology in the enterprise is composed of a number of components, which may be of different types and interact holistically.\nA governance system should be dynamic. This means that any time one or more of the design factors are changed (e.g., a change in strategy or technology), the impact of those changes on the enterprise governance of information and technology (EGIT) system must be considered. A dynamic view of EGIT will result in a viable and future-proof EGIT system.\nA governance system should clearly distinguish between governance and management activities and structures.\nA governance system should be tailored to the needs of the organization and use a set of design factors as parameters for adjusting and prioritizing the components of the governance system.\nA governance system should cover the entire enterprise and focus not only on the IT function, but on all the technology and information processing that the enterprise uses to achieve its goals, regardless of where in the enterprise the processing takes place."

Organizations typically have a primary strategy and, at most, one secondary strategy.\n\nEnterprise goals\n\nThe enterprise strategy is realized by the achievement of (a set of) enterprise goals. These goals are defined in the COBIT framework, structured along the balanced scorecard (BSC) dimensions, e.g., portfolio of competitive products and services, business-service continuity and availability, customer-oriented service culture.\n\nRisk profile\n\nThe risk profile identifies the sort of information & technology-related risk to which the enterprise is currently exposed and indicates which areas of risk are exceeding the risk appetite, e.g., IT operational infrastructure incidents, unauthorized actions, software adoption/usage problems.\n\nI&T-related issues\n\nA related method for an I&T risk assessment for the enterprise is to consider which information & technology-related issues it currently faces, or what I&T-related risk has materialized, e.g., frustration between different IT entities across the organization because of a perception of low contribution to business value or failures to meet IT-related regulatory or contractual requirements.\n\nThreat landscape\n\nThe threat landscape under which the enterprise operates ranging from normal to high.\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nThe compliance requirements to which the enterprise is subject range from low compliance requirements to high compliance requirements, most often related to industry sector or geopolitical conditions.\n\nRole of IT\n\nThe role that IT plays within the company ranges from a support role to production and turnaround to strategy.\n\nSourcing model for IT\n\nDescribes how the IT sources technology, applications and services, spanning insourced, outsourced, cloud or hybrid models.\n\nIT implementation methods\n\nIdentifies how the enterprise implements applications and technologies, ranging from traditional, to agile, DevOps or hybrid models.\n\nTechnology adoption strategy\n\nDescribes if the enterprise is a first mover, a follower or a slow adpoter."

Value reflects a balance between benefits, risk, and resources, and companies need an actionable strategy and governance system to realize that value.\nA governance system for information and technology in the enterprise is composed of a number of components, which may be of different types and interact holistically.\nA governance system should be dynamic. This means that any time one or more of the design factors are changed (e.g., a change in strategy or technology), the impact of those changes on the enterprise governance of information and technology (EGIT) system must be considered. A dynamic view of EGIT will result in a viable and future-proof EGIT system.\nA governance system should clearly distinguish between governance and management activities and structures.\nA governance system should be tailored to the needs of the organization and use a set of design factors as parameters for adjusting and prioritizing the components of the governance system.\nA governance system should cover the entire enterprise and focus not only on the IT function, but on all the technology and information processing that the enterprise uses to achieve its goals, regardless of where in the enterprise the processing takes place."

COBIT focuses on information required for the effective functioning of the governance system of the enterprise.\nCulture, ethics and behavior of individuals and of the enterprise are often underestimated as factors in the success of governance and management activities.\nPeople, skills and competencies are required for good decisions, execution of corrective action and successful completion of all activities.\nServices, infrastructure and applications include the infrastructure, technology and applications that provide the enterprise with the governance system for information and technology (I&T) processing.\n\nTo achieve (any of) the governance and management objectives contained in the COBIT 2019 core model, enterprises should implement an EGIT system composed of these key components."

Organizations typically have a primary strategy and, at most, one secondary strategy.\n\nEnterprise goals\n\nThe enterprise strategy is realized by the achievement of (a set of) enterprise goals. These goals are defined in the COBIT framework, structured along the balanced scorecard (BSC) dimensions, e.g., portfolio of competitive products and services, business-service continuity and availability, customer-oriented service culture.\n\nRisk profile\n\nThe risk profile identifies the sort of information & technology-related risk to which the enterprise is currently exposed and indicates which areas of risk are exceeding the risk appetite, e.g., IT operational infrastructure incidents, unauthorized actions, software adoption/usage problems.\n\nI&T-related issues\n\nA related method for an I&T risk assessment for the enterprise is to consider which information & technology-related issues it currently faces, or what I&T-related risk has materialized, e.g., frustration between different IT entities across the organization because of a perception of low contribution to business value or failures to meet IT-related regulatory or contractual requirements.\n\nThreat landscape\n\nThe threat landscape under which the enterprise operates ranging from normal to high.\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nThe compliance requirements to which the enterprise is subject range from low compliance requirements to high compliance requirements, most often related to industry sector or geopolitical conditions.\n\nRole of IT\n\nThe role that IT plays within the company ranges from a support role to production and turnaround to strategy.\n\nSourcing model for IT\n\nDescribes how the IT sources technology, applications and services, spanning insourced, outsourced, cloud or hybrid models.\n\nIT implementation methods\n\nIdentifies how the enterprise implements applications and technologies, ranging from traditional, to agile, DevOps or hybrid models.\n\nTechnology adoption strategy\n\nDescribes if the enterprise is a first mover, a follower or a slow adpoter."

It includes information about defining the scope, identifying the stakeholders, creating the architecture vision, and obtaining approvals.\nPhase B, C, D: Describe the development of the domain architectures to support an agreed architecture vision.\nPhase E: Opportunities & solutions conducts initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases.\nPhase F: Migration planning addresses the formulation of a set of detailed sequence of transition architectures with a supporting implementation and migration plan.\nPhase G: Implementation governance provides an architectural oversight of the implementation.\nPhase H: Architecture change management establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture.\nRequirements management examines the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM."

Also be clear about the consequences of failing to solve the challenge. You synthesise these into a concise problem statement. There is a need for reference to (scientific) literature here.\nApproach: Describe and discuss your approach to using IT to address the challenge and to create value for the organisation. You also need to consider alternatives to what you propose. Show why your approach is different from the alternatives and why it is more promising.\nSolution: Provides a detailed description of the solution, including technical details. In this section you should clearly show how the (characteristics of the) solution will support or enable your approach to IT-enabled value creation. Please also be specific in your description of the innovative nature of your solution.\nImplementation: This section covers how the organisation should and has implemented your solution, including a discussion of any potential hurdles that may need to be overcome. Also include how you plan to evaluate effectiveness.\nDiscussion: Presents lessons learned, contributions and practical recommendations for action that go beyond the specific challenge. This involves looking at (scientific) literature.\nAppendix: Provides information that may help to gain an even better understanding of your solution.

(2015) four classes of organizations with different competitive strengths and capacity regions for agility can be identified as innovators, disrupters, adapters, and indifferents.\nInnovators identify their competitive strength in being able to identify new opportunities and strive for the ability to make movements that involve a greater degree of variety change, but at the expense of a lower or constant rate of change. They are able to respond to unfamiliar changes in the environment with great diversity.\nAdapters their competitive advantage in generating a higher pace of variety change while maintaining a lower or constant level of variety change. They have a constant willingness to address change quickly, proactively or reactively.\nDisrupters redefine market competition by developing capacity to overcome trade-offs by generating both higher magnitude and greater rate variety change. These organizations explore and exploit opportunities for innovation and competitive performance—they move the efficiency/flexibility tradeoff to simultaneously pursue both.\nIndifferents do not engage in agile based competition in the industry and they do not anticipate the magnitude or rate of variety change to be important properties of their strategic responses."

They are able to respond to unfamiliar changes in the environment with great diversity.\nAdapters their competitive advantage in generating a higher pace of variety change while maintaining a lower or constant level of variety change. They have a constant willingness to address change quickly, proactively or reactively.\nDisrupters redefine market competition by developing capacity to overcome trade-offs by generating both higher magnitude and greater rate variety change. These organizations explore and exploit opportunities for innovation and competitive performance—they move the efficiency/flexibility tradeoff to simultaneously pursue both.\nIndifferents do not engage in agile based competition in the industry and they do not anticipate the magnitude or rate of variety change to be important properties of their strategic responses."

It can also be decomposed into the virtual system, the virtual environment, and the virtual processes. The abstractions of the physical reality often take the form of data models (data structures) and/or behavior models (mathematical or computational models). The virtual system, the virtual environment, and the virtual processes may contain multiple models of the physical counterparts at different levels of abstraction, which may or may not interact with each other (VanDerHorn and Mahadevan 2021, 4).\nVirtual processes play an essential role in the digital twin because they allow future states to be simulated This includes diagnosis and prognosis, design review, simulation and optimization, as well as “what-if” scenarios and sensitivity analyses. Applying virtual processes to the virtual system changes the virtual system states in a similar way that physical processes change the states in a physical system. This allows the user of the digital twin to hypothesize how the physical system would behave under similar physical processes. Thus, decisions can be made about what actions to take based on whether the simulated results match the desired results (e.g., predictive maintenance) (VanDerHorn and Mahadevan 2021, 4).\nThe physical-to-virtual connection via a data interconnection enables the process by which data collected from the physical reality is used to update the states maintained in the virtual representation.

Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don’t, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.\n\nTaris, Beek, and Schaufeli (2014) argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation. The former are attracted by work because it is fun, whereas the latter are driven to work in an attempt to avoid the negative thoughts and feelings that are associated with not working."

    "text": "Definition\nWork engagement refers to “a positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption” (W. Schaufeli et al. 2002, 74)\n\n\nVigor refers to high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in one’s work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties\nDedication refers to being strongly involved in one’s work, and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge\nAbsorption refers to being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one’s work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work\n\n\nWork engagement differs from work addiction. Workaholics are driven by an irresistible inner need to work, and when they don’t, they feel useless, nervous, uneasy, restless and guilty.\n\nTaris, Beek, and Schaufeli (2014) argue that engaged employees have a positive (approach) motivation and workaholics a negative (avoidance) motivation. The former are attracted by work because it is fun, whereas the latter are driven to work in an attempt to avoid the negative thoughts and feelings that are associated with not working."

Jerry Dischler, VP of AdWords Product Management at Google\n\n\n\n\n\nAcceleration of VUCA\n\nVolatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity\n\n\nThe term VUCA was introduced by the US Army War College to describe a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment. It was first used by the Pentagon to describe the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. A few years later it was used by strategic business leaders to describe the chaotic, turbulent and rapidly changing business environment that has become the ‘new reality’ (“VUCA: The New Reality,” n.d.).\nCharacteristic of a VUCA environment is not so much the disruptive upheavals caused by (digital) technology, but rather the speed and scale of disruption specific to the digital age.\n\nVolatility can be defined as the nature, speed, volume and magnitude of change that does not follow a predictable pattern (Sullivan 2012). This is turbulence; a phenomenon that is occurring more frequently and more rapidly than in the past. Typically, market demand in many businesses was already increasingly volatile and unpredictable before the Corona virus crisis, and will be even more so after the containment.\nUncertainty can be seen as the lack of predictability of issues and events (Sullivan 2012). Past issues and events cannot be used to predict future outcomes due to volatility. As a result, forecasting becomes extremely difficult and decision making very challenging for most executives.\nComplexity is the difficulty in understanding the causes and mitigating factors (both inside and outside the organisation) involved in a problem (Sullivan 2012). The layer of complexity, added to the turbulence of change and the absence of past predictors, adds to the difficulty of decision making and leads to confusion.\nAmbiguity is the result of the confusion mentioned above. The lack of clarity about the meaning of the change slows down the decision making process to the point of freezing the status quo (Sullivan 2012).."

Politics can be both ‘functional’ and ‘dysfunctional’."

Hill (2003, 273)\n\nDevelopment of competing coalitions and periods of organizational crisis exacerbate political conflict, while leadership and shared value help to reduce the amount of conflict (Hill 2003).\nLeaders need to define a vision that aligns and motivates people, creates shared values, and a shared culture—these are critical mechanisms for managing the increased diversity and interpedendence in organizations today."

What sources of power do I have to influence this relationship?3 Questions like What can be done to cultivate or repair the relationship? help to cultivate relationships\n\nIt is always better to overestimate rather than underestimate dependencies.

IT kann hier unter anderem dazu eingesetzt werden, die Analyse von großen Datenmengen zu unterstützen.\n\nLesen Sie in den Vorlesungsunterlagen den Exkurs zur Datenvisualisierung und recherchieren Sie zu diesem Konzept.\nSchauen Sie sich folgende Datenvisualisierung an: World’s Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks und beschreiben Sie, wie die IT-gestützte Visualisierung das Information Seeking Mantra unterstützt.\nÜberlegen Sie vor dem Hintergrund der in Kapitel 2 vorgestellten und diskutierten Eigenschaften des digitalen Zeitalters (Stichwort VUCA), weshalb Datenvisualisierung und Exploration ein wichtiger Baustein des Unternehmenserfolgs sein kann.\nWelche Verantwortung und Aufgabe trägt hierfür das IT-Management?\nStellen Sie sich vor, Sie hätten Daten zu Ihrem LinkedIn Netzwerk (oder von einem anderen sozialen Netzwerk), also Daten über Ihre Kontakte und wie diese in Verbindung miteinander stehen. Sie möchten diese visualisieren, um sie dann analysieren zu können. Insbesondere interessiert Sie, welche Gruppen sich in Ihrem Netzwerk identifizieren lassen, was diese Gruppen eint (bspw. frühere Kollegen, gruppiert nach Arbeitgebern) und wie diese Gruppen in Beziehung zueinanderstehen.\nWelche Visualisierungsform würden Sie wählen (für eine Auswahl der Möglichkeiten siehe hier) und welche Daten würden Sie in welcher Art visualisieren, um Ihre Fragen beantworten zu können?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExkurs: Datenvisualisierung\n\n\nDie Daten- und Informationsexploration dient der Erkundung innerer Strukturen von Daten und Informationen aus einer Datenmenge. Viele Phänomene können als mehrdimensionale Datensätze erfasst werden. Die darin enthaltenden und oft verborgenen Informationen können mittels explorativer Analysen erkundet werden. Das ermöglicht es, neues Wissen über die inneren Zusammenhänge und mögliche Muster zu erlangen. Die Datenvisualisierung hilft in diesem Erkundungsprozess durch eine grafische und interaktive Darstellung der Datensätze.\nDie visuelle Datenexploration von Datenmengen kann nach einer dreistufigen Systematik vorgenommen werden, die Ben Shneiderman auch als „Information Seeking Mantra“ bezeichnet hat:\n\nOverview first bedeutet, dass der Datenanalyst sich als erstes einen grundlegenden Überblick über die Datenmenge verschafft (erster Überblick). Erkennt er in dieser Betrachtung mögliche Muster oder Ausnahmen in den Konstellationen, betrachtet er diese Ausschnitte im nächsten Schritt näher.\nZoom and filter bedeutet, dass der Betrachter jetzt fokussiert und die möglichen Datenkonstrukte betrachtet, die ihm als Muster oder Ausnahmen aufgefallen sind (Vergrößern und Filtern). Zur genauen Analyse steigt er in die Details der Daten ein und betrachtet diese tiefgehend.\nDetails-on-demand bedeutet die detaillierte und ausführliche Betrachtung und Analyse der ausgewählten Datenkonstrukte zur Validierung der entdeckten Muster oder Ausnahmen (Detaillierung entsprechend dem gewählten Fokus)."

IT kann hier unter anderem dazu eingesetzt werden, die Analyse von großen Datenmengen zu unterstützen.\n\nLesen Sie in den Vorlesungsunterlagen den Exkurs zur Datenvisualisierung und recherchieren Sie zu diesem Konzept.\nSchauen Sie sich folgende Datenvisualisierung an: World’s Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks und beschreiben Sie, wie die IT-gestützte Visualisierung das Information Seeking Mantra unterstützt.\nÜberlegen Sie vor dem Hintergrund der in Kapitel 2 vorgestellten und diskutierten Eigenschaften des digitalen Zeitalters (Stichwort VUCA), weshalb Datenvisualisierung und Exploration ein wichtiger Baustein des Unternehmenserfolgs sein kann.\nWelche Verantwortung und Aufgabe trägt hierfür das IT-Management?\nStellen Sie sich vor, Sie hätten Daten zu Ihrem LinkedIn Netzwerk (oder von einem anderen sozialen Netzwerk), also Daten über Ihre Kontakte und wie diese in Verbindung miteinander stehen. Sie möchten diese visualisieren, um sie dann analysieren zu können. Insbesondere interessiert Sie, welche Gruppen sich in Ihrem Netzwerk identifizieren lassen, was diese Gruppen eint (bspw. frühere Kollegen, gruppiert nach Arbeitgebern) und wie diese Gruppen in Beziehung zueinanderstehen.\nWelche Visualisierungsform würden Sie wählen (für eine Auswahl der Möglichkeiten siehe hier) und welche Daten würden Sie in welcher Art visualisieren, um Ihre Fragen beantworten zu können?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExkurs: Datenvisualisierung\n\n\n\nDie Daten- und Informationsexploration dient der Erkundung innerer Strukturen von Daten und Informationen aus einer Datenmenge. Viele Phänomene können als mehrdimensionale Datensätze erfasst werden. Die darin enthaltenden und oft verborgenen Informationen können mittels explorativer Analysen erkundet werden. Das ermöglicht es, neues Wissen über die inneren Zusammenhänge und mögliche Muster zu erlangen. Die Datenvisualisierung hilft in diesem Erkundungsprozess durch eine grafische und interaktive Darstellung der Datensätze.\nDie visuelle Datenexploration von Datenmengen kann nach einer dreistufigen Systematik vorgenommen werden, die Ben Shneiderman auch als „Information Seeking Mantra“ bezeichnet hat:\n\nOverview first bedeutet, dass der Datenanalyst sich als erstes einen grundlegenden Überblick über die Datenmenge verschafft (erster Überblick). Erkennt er in dieser Betrachtung mögliche Muster oder Ausnahmen in den Konstellationen, betrachtet er diese Ausschnitte im nächsten Schritt näher.\nZoom and filter bedeutet, dass der Betrachter jetzt fokussiert und die möglichen Datenkonstrukte betrachtet, die ihm als Muster oder Ausnahmen aufgefallen sind (Vergrößern und Filtern). Zur genauen Analyse steigt er in die Details der Daten ein und betrachtet diese tiefgehend.\nDetails-on-demand bedeutet die detaillierte und ausführliche Betrachtung und Analyse der ausgewählten Datenkonstrukte zur Validierung der entdeckten Muster oder Ausnahmen (Detaillierung entsprechend dem gewählten Fokus)."

Eine wesentliche Rolle spielte hierbei die Erfindung des World Wide Webs (WWW) als zentraler Dienst des Internets zur Übertragung von Daten (zur ersten Website des Internets).\nDas WWW ermöglichte erstmals den gleichzeitigen Austausch von Text-, Bild-, Audio- und Video-Daten über eine grafische Benutzeroberfläche (Browser). Zudem konnten diese Daten relativ einfach erstellt, verknüpft (Links) und verbreitet werden.\nIn den späten 90er Jahren entstand die ‚New Economy‘ als Erscheinungsform eines Marktes, der auf (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen, die über das Internet erbracht werden, ausgerichtet ist (bspw. digitaler Handel). Das Platzen dieser Marktblase wurde aufgrund zu hoch gesetzter Erwartungen verursacht und beendet diese erste Stufe des digitalen Zeitalters.\nStufe 2\nIn der zweiten Evolutionsstufe (Akzeptanz und alltägliche Nutzung) von 2000 bis ca. 2015 setzten sich digitale Dienste und (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen. Das Internet wurde durch die Verfügbarkeit unterschiedlicher mobiler Endgeräte (bspw. iPod, iPhone, iPad) sowie breitbandiger Internet-Zugang für die Masse zunehmend verfügbar und zunehmend mobil. Zudem begannen die sozialen Angebote im Internet die Kommunikation und Interaktion von Menschen tiefgreifend zu verändern (bspw. Facebook).\nStufe 3\nIn der dritten Evolutionsstufe (zunehmende Vernetzung) um 2015 bis ca. 2030 setzt sich das “Internet der Dinge” durch. Die Vernetzung von physischer und digitaler Welt ist das zentrale Merkmal dieser Stufe. Viele Produkte und Alltagsgegenstände werden durch Vernetzung und dem (automatisierten) Austausch digitaler Daten und Informationen ‚intelligent‘ bzw. ‚smart‘ (bspw. die Zahnbürste). Physische Produkte erweitern zunehmend ihren Nutzen durch digitale Lösungen (bspw. Zahnputztipps).\nStufe 4\nIn der vierten Evolutionsstufe (vollkommene Verschmelzung) sollen reale und digitale Welten vollständig verschmelzen (Stichwort “Metaverse”). Digitalisierung und Vernetzung sind dann weltweit integraler Bestandteil des alltäglichen Lebens.\nNach Claudia Lemke und Brenner (2015, p. 19ff)"

Design Thinking zielt darauf ab, mit Methoden des Desings nutzer- und kundenorientierte Ergebnisse zur Lösung von komplexen Problemen zu liefern. Die Methode baut auf einem interaktiven Prozess und den drei Prinzipien Kundenzentrierung, Iteration und Prototyping sowie die Lösungsoffenheit auf.\nDer Design-Thinking-Prozess stellt den Menschen und seine Bedürfnisse in den Mittelpunkt. Es wird daher häufig von Human-Centered-Design gesprochen. Voraussetzung dafür ist, dass eine potenzielle Zielgruppe bereits bei Beginn des Prozesses gegeben ist. Durch Rückkopplung wird diese frühzeitig in die Problemdefinition und Lösungsfindung einbezogen. Mögliche Nutzer werden befragt aber auch beobachtet und begleitet. Lösungen und Ideen werden in Form von Prototypen im Design Thinking früh sichtbar und vermittelbar gemacht, damit potenzielle Anwender sie – noch lange vor der Fertigstellung oder Markteinführung – testen und Feedback geben können.\nNicht-Designer, beispielsweise Entrepreneure oder Manager, können mithilfe von Design Thinking neue Sichtweisen auf Probleme und mögliche Lösungen erhalten. Die Methode kombiniert Empathie gegenüber den Nutzern und seinen Problemen mit Kreativität auf der Suche nach geeigneten Lösungen unter Einsatz rationaler Überlegungen bei der Analyse, Bewertung und Auswahl der verschiedenen Alternativen. Ziel des Design Thinking ist die Entwicklung von Innovationen, beispielsweise die Entwicklung innovativer Produkte, Services oder Erlebnisse.\nQuelle: C. Lemke, Brenner, und Kirchner (2017)"

Eine wesentliche Rolle spielte hierbei die Erfindung des World Wide Webs (WWW) als zentraler Dienst des Internets zur Übertragung von Daten (zur ersten Website des Internets).\nDas WWW ermöglichte erstmals den gleichzeitigen Austausch von Text-, Bild-, Audio- und Video-Daten über eine grafische Benutzeroberfläche (Browser). Zudem konnten diese Daten relativ einfach erstellt, verknüpft (Links) und verbreitet werden.\nIn den späten 90er Jahren entstand die ‚New Economy‘ als Erscheinungsform eines Marktes, der auf (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen, die über das Internet erbracht werden, ausgerichtet ist (bspw. digitaler Handel). Das Platzen dieser Marktblase wurde aufgrund zu hoch gesetzter Erwartungen verursacht und beendet diese erste Stufe des digitalen Zeitalters.\n\n\nStufe 2\nIn der zweiten Evolutionsstufe (Akzeptanz und alltägliche Nutzung) von 2000 bis ca. 2015 setzten sich digitale Dienste und (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen. Das Internet wurde durch die Verfügbarkeit unterschiedlicher mobiler Endgeräte (bspw. iPod, iPhone, iPad) sowie breitbandiger Internet-Zugang für die Masse zunehmend verfügbar und zunehmend mobil. Zudem begannen die sozialen Angebote im Internet die Kommunikation und Interaktion von Menschen tiefgreifend zu verändern (bspw. Facebook).\n\n\nStufe 3\nIn der dritten Evolutionsstufe (zunehmende Vernetzung) um 2015 bis ca. 2030 setzt sich das “Internet der Dinge” durch. Die Vernetzung von physischer und digitaler Welt ist das zentrale Merkmal dieser Stufe. Viele Produkte und Alltagsgegenstände werden durch Vernetzung und dem (automatisierten) Austausch digitaler Daten und Informationen ‚intelligent‘ bzw. ‚smart‘ (bspw. die Zahnbürste). Physische Produkte erweitern zunehmend ihren Nutzen durch digitale Lösungen (bspw. Zahnputztipps).\n\n\nStufe 4\nIn der vierten Evolutionsstufe (vollkommene Verschmelzung) sollen reale und digitale Welten vollständig verschmelzen (Stichwort “Metaverse”). Digitalisierung und Vernetzung sind dann weltweit integraler Bestandteil des alltäglichen Lebens.\nNach Claudia Lemke und Brenner (2015, p. 19ff)"

In großen Netzwerken kann der Nutzwert mit \\(U = n^2\\) angenähert werden (Faustregel).\nDie Faustregel geht davon aus, dass der Nutzen des Netzwerkes proportional zur Anzahl der möglichen Verbindungen zwischen den Teilnehmern wächst, während die Kosten nur proportional zur Anzahl der Knoten selbst wachsen.\nDadurch lässt sich erklären, weshalb heute in der Regel nur wenige, sehr große Netzwerke erfolgreich sind (bspw. WhatsApp).\n\nBeispiel Soziale Netzwerke Je mehr Nutzer ein soziales Netzwerk hat, umso attraktiver wird dieses, weil so die Chancen steigen, dort die eigenen Freunde und Bekannten zu finden. Und je mehr Nutzer ein Netzwerk hat hat, desto mehr Geld verdient es (bspw. durch Werbung). Mit diesen Gewinnen kann nicht nur das Netzwerk verbessert, sondern durch den Zukauf von Unternehmen (anderen Netzwerken) neue Märkte erschließen und das Netzwerk erweitern. So kann man beispielsweise die Dominanz von Facebook erklären, aber auch die von Amazon"

Produkte online zu verkaufen) und die notwendigen Informationen zu bereitzustellen und zu verarbeiten.\nInformationssysteme enthalten die dafür notwendige Technologie (insbesondere Hard- und Software) und Daten. Darüber hinaus umfassen Informationssysteme auch die Organisationsstrukturen, in die sie eingebettet sind und die Menschen, die mit ihnen arbeiten (Krcmar 2015, p. 8; Laudon, Laudon, und Schoder 2016, p. 14-15).\nBetriebliche Informationssysteme bilden die Basis für effektives und effizientes Informationsmanagement im (digitalen) Unternehmen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem\n\n\n\nAls System wird etwas bezeichnet, das aus verschiedenen Komponenten mit unterschiedlichen Eigenschaften besteht, die aufgrund bestimmter geordneter Beziehungen untereinander als gemeinsames Ganzes betrachtet werden (können) und damit von ihrer Umwelt (anderen Systemen) abgrenzbar sind. Ein Element eines Systems kann ebenfalls ein System sein — dieses wird dann als Subsystem bezeichnet (Alpar u. a. 2019, p. 15)."

Das bedeutet, dass es für die in dieser Organisation gegebenen spezifischen Rahmenbedingungen konstruiert wurde und nur in der gegebenen Organisation die volle Wirkung entfalten kann. Deshalb kann ein Informationssystem auch nicht einfach gekauft werden, sondern muss individuell entwickelt und angepasst werden (Laudon, Laudon, und Schoder 2016, p.15).\n\nInformationssysteme umfassen in der Regel ein oder mehrere Anwendungssystemen (Anwendungssoftware).\nAnwendungssysteme2 können “von der Stange” gekauft oder aus der Cloud als Software as a Service verwendet werden. Diese müssen dann aber in Abstimmung mit den anderen Komponenten eingeführt und zum Informationssystem ausgebaut werden.2 Ein Anwendungssystem ist ein System, dass alle Programme (Anwendungssoftware) beinhaltet, die für ein bestimmtes Aufgabengebiet entwickelt und eingesetzt werden, inkl. der IT-Infrastruktur, auf der die Anwendungssoftware läuft, und der Daten, die erzeugt und genutzt werden (nach Laudon, Laudon, und Schoder 2016, p.15).\nSysteme lassen sich nicht immer klar als Anwendungssystem oder als Informationssystem charakterisieren. Es existieren Anwendungssysteme, die kaum losgelöst von der Organisation in der sie verwendet werden betrachtet werden können.\nDie Begriffe Informationssystem und Anwendungssystem werden deshalb in der Praxis oft synonym verwendet."

The reason for that is quite simple: often, all the conditions for an action that are necessary to achieve the intended effect can’t be known.

For example, the phrase “first quarter” occurs more frequently in business (or sports) articles than would be suggested by multiplying the probabilities of “first” and “quarter.” The violation of independence usually means that the final posterior probabilities will be much closer to 1 or 0 than they should be; in other words, the model is overconfident in its predictions. On the other hand, even with these errors, the ranking of the possible categories is often quite accurate. Naive Bayes models are widely used for language determination, document retrieval, spam filtering, and other classification tasks. For tasks such as medical diagnosis, where the actual values of the posterior probabilities really matter–for example, in deciding wether to perform an appendoctomy–one would usually prefer to use more sophisticated models such as Bayesian networks (Russel and Norvig 2022, 422)."

    "text": "Example\nRecker (2021, 36 ff) uses following example on the motivation of a research question:\nOrganisations invest heavily in new information technology to seek benefits from these investments.\nIn this statement, we learn about a problem domain: investments into IT and benefit realisation from IT. This is an important problem domain for businesses because it involves money. As a tip, motivating research problems by citing data that confirm the quantifiable value associated with the problem (dollars spent, money lost, for example) might be valuable. Within this domain, we then learn about one important phenomenon:\nMany of these benefits never materialise because employees do not use the technologies.\nHere we drill down to a particularly important phenomenon of interest, individuals’ rejection of IT (i.e., their unwillingness to use IT), which narrows the problem domain down and will be useful in focussing the research later on. Finally, we learn about an important problem in the available knowledge that relates to this phenomenon:\nThe literature to date has studied only why individuals accept new technologies but not why they reject them.\nHere we make a statement about the current body of knowledge. The problem with the body of knowledge we have (i.e., the literature available to date) is that it has a gap—that is, we do not know enough yet to address the specific phenomenon in the problem domain. For example, as the Covid-19 pandemic spread across the globe in 2020, at the beginning we had very little knowledge about the virus, its infection rates, and its possible cures or vaccinations. The problem then was a gap of knowledge.\nA “gap” in knowledge is a typical problem with the available knowledge, but it is not necessarily the best or only problem (Alvesson and Sandberg 2011). For example, we could develop a set of arguments to strengthen the proposition that our theories on technology acceptance (e.g., Venkatesh et al. 2003) fail to predict the opposite, rejection of technology, conclusively. Other typical problems with the knowledge could be that they have yielded inconsistent results: study A suggests one thing and study B suggests an opposite thing, so which is correct? That is a problem. Another problem might be that the knowledge to date rests on assumptions that are no longer current or realistic, such as when studies assume that findings for a sample of men must also apply to women.\nHaving introduced an important problem domain with a specific phenomenon and a substantial problem with the knowledge to date allows us to formulate a research question as the logical conclusion to these arguments:\nWhy do people reject new information technology?"

Eine wesentliche Rolle spielte hierbei die Erfindung des World Wide Webs (WWW) als zentraler Dienst des Internets zur Übertragung von Daten (zur ersten Website des Internets).\nDas WWW ermöglichte erstmals den gleichzeitigen Austausch von Text-, Bild-, Audio- und Video-Daten über eine grafische Benutzeroberfläche (Browser). Zudem konnten diese Daten relativ einfach erstellt, verknüpft (Links) und verbreitet werden.\nIn den späten 90er Jahren entstand die ‚New Economy‘ als Erscheinungsform eines Marktes, der auf (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen, die über das Internet erbracht werden, ausgerichtet ist (bspw. digitaler Handel). Das Platzen dieser Marktblase wurde aufgrund zu hoch gesetzter Erwartungen verursacht und beendet diese erste Stufe des digitalen Zeitalters.\nStufe 2\nIn der zweiten Evolutionsstufe (Akzeptanz und alltägliche Nutzung) von 2000 bis ca. 2015 setzten sich digitale Dienste und (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen. Das Internet wurde durch die Verfügbarkeit unterschiedlicher mobiler Endgeräte (bspw. iPod, iPhone, iPad) sowie breitbandiger Internet-Zugang für die Masse zunehmend verfügbar und zunehmend mobil. Zudem begannen die sozialen Angebote im Internet die Kommunikation und Interaktion von Menschen tiefgreifend zu verändern (bspw. Facebook).\nStufe 3\nIn der dritten Evolutionsstufe (zunehmende Vernetzung) um 2015 bis ca. 2030 setzt sich das „Internet der Dinge“ durch. Die Vernetzung von physischer und digitaler Welt ist das zentrale Merkmal dieser Stufe. Viele Produkte und Alltagsgegenstände werden durch Vernetzung und dem (automatisierten) Austausch digitaler Daten und Informationen ‚intelligent‘ bzw. ‚smart‘ (bspw. die Zahnbürste). Physische Produkte erweitern zunehmend ihren Nutzen durch digitale Lösungen (bspw. Zahnputztipps).\nStufe 4\nIn der vierten Evolutionsstufe (vollkommene Verschmelzung) sollen reale und digitale Welten vollständig verschmelzen (Stichwort “Metaverse”). Digitalisierung und Vernetzung sind dann weltweit integraler Bestandteil des alltäglichen Lebens.\nNach Claudia Lemke und Brenner (2015, p. 19ff)"

Und je mehr Nutzer ein Netzwerk hat hat, desto mehr Geld verdient es (bspw. durch Werbung).

    "text": "Evolutionsstufen\n\n\n\nAbbildung 1: Evolutionsstufen des digitalen Zeitalters nach Claudia Lemke und Brenner (2015)\n\n\n\n\nStufe 1\nIn der ersten Evolutionsstufe (Entstehung und Verbreitung) von ca. 1990 bis 2000 stand vor allem die Vernetzung von Computern im Vordergrund der Entwicklung. Eine wesentliche Rolle spielte hierbei die Erfindung des World Wide Webs (WWW) als zentraler Dienst des Internets zur Übertragung von Daten (zur ersten Website des Internets).\nDas WWW ermöglichte erstmals den gleichzeitigen Austausch von Text-, Bild-, Audio- und Video-Daten über eine grafische Benutzeroberfläche (Browser). Zudem konnten diese Daten relativ einfach erstellt, verknüpft (Links) und verbreitet werden.\nIn den späten 90er Jahren entstand die ‚New Economy‘ als Erscheinungsform eines Marktes, der auf (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen, die über das Internet erbracht werden, ausgerichtet ist (bspw. digitaler Handel). Das Platzen dieser Marktblase wurde aufgrund zu hoch gesetzter Erwartungen verursacht und beendet diese erste Stufe des digitalen Zeitalters.\n\n\nStufe 2\nIn der zweiten Evolutionsstufe (Akzeptanz und alltägliche Nutzung) von 2000 bis ca. 2015 setzten sich digitale Dienste und (informationsbasierte) Dienstleistungen. Das Internet wurde durch die Verfügbarkeit unterschiedlicher mobiler Endgeräte (bspw. iPod, iPhone, iPad) sowie breitbandiger Internet-Zugang für die Masse zunehmend verfügbar und zunehmend mobil. Zudem begannen die sozialen Angebote im Internet die Kommunikation und Interaktion von Menschen tiefgreifend zu verändern (bspw. Facebook).\n\n\nStufe 3\nIn der dritten Evolutionsstufe (zunehmende Vernetzung) um 2015 bis ca. 2030 setzt sich das „Internet der Dinge“ durch. Die Vernetzung von physischer und digitaler Welt ist das zentrale Merkmal dieser Stufe. Viele Produkte und Alltagsgegenstände werden durch Vernetzung und dem (automatisierten) Austausch digitaler Daten und Informationen ‚intelligent‘ bzw. ‚smart‘ (bspw. die Zahnbürste). Physische Produkte erweitern zunehmend ihren Nutzen durch digitale Lösungen (bspw. Zahnputztipps).\n\n\nStufe 4\nIn der vierten Evolutionsstufe (vollkommene Verschmelzung) sollen reale und digitale Welten vollständig verschmelzen (Stichwort “Metaverse”). Digitalisierung und Vernetzung sind dann weltweit integraler Bestandteil des alltäglichen Lebens.\nNach Claudia Lemke und Brenner (2015, p. 19ff)"

In großen Netzwerken kann der Nutzwert mit \\(U = n^2\\) angenähert werden (Faustregel).\nDie Faustregel geht davon aus, dass der Nutzen des Netzwerkes proportional zur Anzahl der möglichen Verbindungen zwischen den Teilnehmern wächst, während die Kosten nur proportional zur Anzahl der Knoten selbst wachsen.\nDadurch lässt sich erklären, weshalb heute in der Regel nur wenige, sehr große Netzwerke erfolgreich sind (bspw. WhatsApp).\n\nBeispiel Soziale Netzwerke Je mehr Nutzer ein soziales Netzwerk hat, umso attraktiver wird dieses, weil so die Chancen steigen, dort die eigenen Freunde und Bekannten zu finden. Und je mehr Nutzer ein Netzwerk hat hat, desto mehr Geld verdient es (bspw. durch Werbung). Mit diesen Gewinnen kann nicht nur das Netzwerk verbessert, sondern durch den Zukauf von Unternehmen (anderen Netzwerken) neue Märkte erschließen und das Netzwerk erweitern. So kann man beispielsweise die Dominanz von Facebook erklären, aber auch die von Amazon"

    "text": "Business Engineering\nZur Wiederholung und Einordnung: Unter Business Engineering versteht man die ingenieurmäßige Vorgehensweise bei der Gestaltung eines Unternehmens.\n\nBusiness Engineering überspannt den kompletten Prozess von der Strategiefindung und der Ableitung von Geschäftsmodellen bis zur optimalen Gestaltung der Abläufe sowie zugehöriger Anwendungssysteme (Abts und Mülder 2017; Leimeister 2021).\n\n\nDas Business Engineering Modell kann somit um die Ebene des Geschäftsmodells ergänzt werden (Al-Debei und Avison 2010).\n\nIn der Praxis sind die Begriffe Strategie und Geschäftsmodell oft nicht eindeutig abgegrenzt, was zu einem erschwerten Begriffsverständnis und oftmals auch Verständnisschwierigkeiten beiträgt. Der wissenschaftliche Diskurs zeigt jedoch, dass die Strategie und das Geschäftsmodell eines Unternehmens nicht identisch sind, sondern sich voneinander unterscheiden.\nEine Unternehmensstrategie legt langfristige Ziele sowie grundsätzliche Maßnahmen fest, diese zu erreichen. Basis für die langfristige Ausrichtung eines Unternehmens sind sowohl dessen interne Stärken und Schwächen als auch die unternehmensexternen Chancen und Risiken der Umwelt. Die Stärken eines Unternehmens sollen mit den Chancen der Umwelt in Einklang gebracht werden, wobei gleichzeitig die eigenen Schwächen verringert und die externen Risiken vermieden werden sollen. Kurzum: Strategie beschreibt, wie sich ein Unternehmen gegenüber Konkurrenten durchsetzen kann.\nDahingegen beschreibt das Geschäftsmodell auf abstrakter Ebene wie die Unternehmensressourcen so koordiniert werden, so dass Wert geschaffen wird oder in Zukunft geschaffen werden soll. Aus dem Geschäftsmodell lassen sich dann die spezifischen Geschäftsprozesse ableiten. Diese beschreiben im Detail, wie mit Hilfe von Tätigkeitsketten aus verschiedenen Produktionsfaktoren (Input) ein spezifisches Ergebnis (Output) erzeugt wird.\nStrategien unterscheiden sich von Geschäftsmodellen also insbesondere darin, dass Strategien zukunftsorientiert sind und eine langfristige Perspektive verfolgen, wohingegen Geschäftsmodelle eher gegenwartsbezogen sind und die aktuelle Logik zur Erzeugung von Wert beschreiben. Eine Strategie kann zu unterschiedlichen Geschäftsmodellen führen, ein Geschäftsmodell ist deshalb nur eine mögliche Abbildung der Strategie.\nDas Unternehmen, die eine gleiche Strategie verfolgen, diese durch unterschiedliche Geschäftsmodelle umsetzen können zeigt sich unter anderem bei Fluggesellschaften. Fluggesellschaften wie Ryanair und Eurowings verfolgen eine Wettbewerbsstrategie, die als Preisführerschaft bezeichnet wird (low-cost Airlines). Die Unternehmen unterscheiden sich aber in der Art und Weise, wie sie ihr Geschäftsmodell konzipiert haben. Unterschiede lassen sich z.B. hinsichtlich des Partnernetzwerkes (Eurowings ist Teil der Lufthansa Gruppe), des Codesharings, sowie des Kundenservices feststellen."

    "text": "Business Engineering\nZur Wiederholung und Einordnung: Unter Business Engineering versteht man die ingenieurmäßige Vorgehensweise bei der Gestaltung eines Unternehmens.\nBusiness Engineering überspannt den kompletten Prozess von der Strategiefindung und der Ableitung von Geschäftsmodellen bis zur optimalen Gestaltung der Abläufe sowie zugehöriger Anwendungssysteme (Abts und Mülder 2017; Leimeister 2021).\nDas Business Engineering Modell kann somit um die Ebene des Geschäftsmodells ergänzt werden (Al-Debei und Avison 2010).\n\nIn der Praxis sind die Begriffe Strategie und Geschäftsmodell oft nicht eindeutig abgegrenzt, was zu einem erschwerten Begriffsverständnis und oftmals auch Verständnisschwierigkeiten beiträgt. Der wissenschaftliche Diskurs zeigt jedoch, dass die Strategie und das Geschäftsmodell eines Unternehmens nicht identisch sind, sondern sich voneinander unterscheiden.\nEine Unternehmensstrategie legt langfristige Ziele sowie grundsätzliche Maßnahmen fest, diese zu erreichen. Basis für die langfristige Ausrichtung eines Unternehmens sind sowohl dessen interne Stärken und Schwächen als auch die unternehmensexternen Chancen und Risiken der Umwelt. Die Stärken eines Unternehmens sollen mit den Chancen der Umwelt in Einklang gebracht werden, wobei gleichzeitig die eigenen Schwächen verringert und die externen Risiken vermieden werden sollen. Kurzum: Strategie beschreibt, wie sich ein Unternehmen gegenüber Konkurrenten durchsetzen kann.\nDahingegen beschreibt das Geschäftsmodell auf abstrakter Ebene wie die Unternehmensressourcen so koordiniert werden, so dass Wert geschaffen wird oder in Zukunft geschaffen werden soll. Aus dem Geschäftsmodell lassen sich dann die spezifischen Geschäftsprozesse ableiten. Diese beschreiben im Detail, wie mit Hilfe von Tätigkeitsketten aus verschiedenen Produktionsfaktoren (Input) ein spezifisches Ergebnis (Output) erzeugt wird.\nStrategien unterscheiden sich von Geschäftsmodellen also insbesondere darin, dass Strategien zukunftsorientiert sind und eine langfristige Perspektive verfolgen, wohingegen Geschäftsmodelle eher gegenwartsbezogen sind und die aktuelle Logik zur Erzeugung von Wert beschreiben. Eine Strategie kann zu unterschiedlichen Geschäftsmodellen führen, ein Geschäftsmodell ist deshalb nur eine mögliche Abbildung der Strategie.\nDas Unternehmen, die eine gleiche Strategie verfolgen, diese durch unterschiedliche Geschäftsmodelle umsetzen können zeigt sich unter anderem bei Fluggesellschaften. Fluggesellschaften wie Ryanair und Eurowings verfolgen eine Wettbewerbsstrategie, die als Preisführerschaft bezeichnet wird (low-cost Airlines). Die Unternehmen unterscheiden sich aber in der Art und Weise, wie sie ihr Geschäftsmodell konzipiert haben. Unterschiede lassen sich z.B. hinsichtlich des Partnernetzwerkes (Eurowings ist Teil der Lufthansa Gruppe), des Codesharings, sowie des Kundenservices feststellen."

IT kann hier unter anderem dazu eingesetzt werden, die Analyse von großen Datenmengen zu unterstützen.\n\nLesen Sie in den Vorlesungsunterlagen den Exkurs zur Datenvisualisierung und recherchieren Sie zu diesem Konzept.\nSchauen Sie sich folgende Datenvisualisierung an: World’s Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks und beschreiben Sie, wie die IT-gestützte Visualisierung das Information Seeking Mantra unterstützt.\nÜberlegen Sie vor dem Hintergrund der in Kapitel 2 vorgestellten und diskutierten Eigenschaften des digitalen Zeitalters (Stichwort VUCA), weshalb Datenvisualisierung und Exploration ein wichtiger Baustein des Unternehmenserfolgs sein kann.\nWelche Verantwortung und Aufgabe trägt hierfür das IT-Management?\nStellen Sie sich vor, Sie hätten Daten zu Ihrem LinkedIn Netzwerk (oder von einem anderen sozialen Netzwerk), also Daten über Ihre Kontakte und wie diese in Verbindung miteinander stehen. Sie möchten diese visualisieren, um sie dann analysieren zu können. Insbesondere interessiert Sie, welche Gruppen sich in Ihrem Netzwerk identifizieren lassen, was diese Gruppen eint (bspw. frühere Kollegen, gruppiert nach Arbeitgebern) und wie diese Gruppen in Beziehung zueinanderstehen.\nWelche Visualisierungsform würden Sie wählen (für eine Auswahl der Möglichkeiten siehe hier) und welche Daten würden Sie in welcher Art visualisieren, um Ihre Fragen beantworten zu können?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExkurs: Datenvisualisierung\n\n\nDie Daten- und Informationsexploration dient der Erkundung innerer Strukturen von Daten und Informationen aus einer Datenmenge. Viele Phänomene können als mehrdimensionale Datensätze erfasst werden. Die darin enthaltenden und oft verborgenen Informationen können mittels explorativer Analysen erkundet werden. Das ermöglicht es, neues Wissen über die inneren Zusammenhänge und mögliche Muster zu erlangen. Die Datenvisualisierung hilft in diesem Erkundungsprozess durch eine grafische und interaktive Darstellung der Datensätze.\nDie visuelle Datenexploration von Datenmengen kann nach einer dreistufigen Systematik vorgenommen werden, die Ben Shneiderman auch als „Information Seeking Mantra“ bezeichnet hat:\n\nOverview first bedeutet, dass der Datenanalyst sich als erstes einen grundlegenden Überblick über die Datenmenge verschafft (erster Überblick). Erkennt er in dieser Betrachtung mögliche Muster oder Ausnahmen in den Konstellationen, betrachtet er diese Ausschnitte im nächsten Schritt näher.\nZoom and filter bedeutet, dass der Betrachter jetzt fokussiert und die möglichen Datenkonstrukte betrachtet, die ihm als Muster oder Ausnahmen aufgefallen sind (Vergrößern und Filtern). Zur genauen Analyse steigt er in die Details der Daten ein und betrachtet diese tiefgehend.\nDetails-on-demand bedeutet die detaillierte und ausführliche Betrachtung und Analyse der ausgewählten Datenkonstrukte zur Validierung der entdeckten Muster oder Ausnahmen (Detaillierung entsprechend dem gewählten Fokus)."

IT kann hier unter anderem dazu eingesetzt werden, die Analyse von großen Datenmengen zu unterstützen.\n\nLesen Sie in den Vorlesungsunterlagen den Exkurs zur Datenvisualisierung und recherchieren Sie zu diesem Konzept.\nSchauen Sie sich folgende Datenvisualisierung an: World’s Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks und beschreiben Sie, wie die IT-gestützte Visualisierung das Information Seeking Mantra unterstützt.\nÜberlegen Sie vor dem Hintergrund der in Kapitel 2 vorgestellten und diskutierten Eigenschaften des digitalen Zeitalters (Stichwort VUCA), weshalb Datenvisualisierung und Exploration ein wichtiger Baustein des Unternehmenserfolgs sein kann.\nWelche Verantwortung und Aufgabe trägt hierfür das IT-Management?\nStellen Sie sich vor, Sie hätten Daten zu Ihrem LinkedIn Netzwerk (oder von einem anderen sozialen Netzwerk), also Daten über Ihre Kontakte und wie diese in Verbindung miteinander stehen. Sie möchten diese visualisieren, um sie dann analysieren zu können. Insbesondere interessiert Sie, welche Gruppen sich in Ihrem Netzwerk identifizieren lassen, was diese Gruppen eint (bspw. frühere Kollegen, gruppiert nach Arbeitgebern) und wie diese Gruppen in Beziehung zueinanderstehen.\nWelche Visualisierungsform würden Sie wählen (für eine Auswahl der Möglichkeiten siehe hier) und welche Daten würden Sie in welcher Art visualisieren, um Ihre Fragen beantworten zu können?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExkurs: Datenvisualisierung\n\n\n\nDie Daten- und Informationsexploration dient der Erkundung innerer Strukturen von Daten und Informationen aus einer Datenmenge. Viele Phänomene können als mehrdimensionale Datensätze erfasst werden. Die darin enthaltenden und oft verborgenen Informationen können mittels explorativer Analysen erkundet werden. Das ermöglicht es, neues Wissen über die inneren Zusammenhänge und mögliche Muster zu erlangen. Die Datenvisualisierung hilft in diesem Erkundungsprozess durch eine grafische und interaktive Darstellung der Datensätze.\nDie visuelle Datenexploration von Datenmengen kann nach einer dreistufigen Systematik vorgenommen werden, die Ben Shneiderman auch als „Information Seeking Mantra“ bezeichnet hat:\n\nOverview first bedeutet, dass der Datenanalyst sich als erstes einen grundlegenden Überblick über die Datenmenge verschafft (erster Überblick). Erkennt er in dieser Betrachtung mögliche Muster oder Ausnahmen in den Konstellationen, betrachtet er diese Ausschnitte im nächsten Schritt näher.\nZoom and filter bedeutet, dass der Betrachter jetzt fokussiert und die möglichen Datenkonstrukte betrachtet, die ihm als Muster oder Ausnahmen aufgefallen sind (Vergrößern und Filtern). Zur genauen Analyse steigt er in die Details der Daten ein und betrachtet diese tiefgehend.\nDetails-on-demand bedeutet die detaillierte und ausführliche Betrachtung und Analyse der ausgewählten Datenkonstrukte zur Validierung der entdeckten Muster oder Ausnahmen (Detaillierung entsprechend dem gewählten Fokus)."

Beispiel: Produktentwicklung.\nUnterstützungsprozesse erzeugen Leistungen für interne Kunden und ermöglichen den reibungslosen Ablauf der Kernprozesse. Sie haben keine strategische Bedeutung. Beispiel: Lohn- und Gehaltsabrechnung.\nIn Unternehmen, die entlang der Wertschöpfungskette organisiert sind, durchlaufen sowohl Kernprozesse als auch Unterstützungsprozesse in der Regel meist mehrere organisatorischen Einheiten (oft Abteilungen). Die Prozesse sind also „abteilungsübergreifend”. Die Optimierung solcher Prozesse erfordert prozessorientierte Denken. Im Kontrast zum funktionalen Denken, das sich mit den Aufgaben des eigenen Funktionsbereichs beschäftigt, umfasst prozessorientiertes Denken die gesamte Prozesskette, ggf. auch über mehrere Abteilungen oder Bereiche hinweg.\n\nEin typisches Beispiel für die unterschiedliche Sichtweise von Prozess- und Funktionsdenken ist die Beschaffung von Waren und Dienstleistungen. Im Rahmen der Gestaltung der Beschaffungsabläufe tritt regelmäßig die Frage auf, welchem Bereich die Teilaufgabe der „Rechnungsprüfung” zugeordnet werden soll: der Logistik oder dem Rechnungswesen. Für den Bereich Logistik spricht, dass die Rechnungsprüfung die qualitative und mengenmäßige Kontrolle durchführt. Die Logistik verfolgt unter anderem das Ziel, die richtige Ware in der richtigen Menge und Qualität zur richtigen Zeit zum Empfänger zu transportieren. Das Rechnungswesen beansprucht oft die Verantwortung für die Überprüfung von Kontierungen und Zahlungsbedingungen. Das Rechnungswesen hat unter anderem das Ziel, eine ordnungsgemäße Bilanz und Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung aufzustellen. Wird der Prozess gesplittet, beispielsweise in der Art, dass zunächst die qualitative und Mengenkontrolle in der Logistik durchgeführt wird und später nach Weitergabe der Dokumente die kaufmännische bzw. finanztechnische Prüfung im Rechnungswesen erfolgt, sind fast zwangsläufig durch den Bearbeiterwechsel Verzögerungen zu erwarten."

Beispiel: Produktentwicklung.\nUnterstützungsprozesse erzeugen Leistungen für interne Kunden und ermöglichen den reibungslosen Ablauf der Kernprozesse. Sie haben keine strategische Bedeutung. Beispiel: Lohn- und Gehaltsabrechnung.\nIn Unternehmen, die entlang der Wertschöpfungskette organisiert sind, durchlaufen sowohl Kernprozesse als auch Unterstützungsprozesse in der Regel meist mehrere organisatorischen Einheiten (oft Abteilungen). Die Prozesse sind also „abteilungsübergreifend”. Die Optimierung solcher Prozesse erfordert prozessorientierte Denken. Im Kontrast zum funktionalen Denken, das sich mit den Aufgaben des eigenen Funktionsbereichs beschäftigt, umfasst prozessorientiertes Denken die gesamte Prozesskette, ggf. auch über mehrere Abteilungen oder Bereiche hinweg.\n\nEin typisches Beispiel für die unterschiedliche Sichtweise von Prozess- und Funktionsdenken ist die Beschaffung von Waren und Dienstleistungen. Im Rahmen der Gestaltung der Beschaffungsabläufe tritt regelmäßig die Frage auf, welchem Bereich die Teilaufgabe der „Rechnungsprüfung” zugeordnet werden soll: der Logistik oder dem Rechnungswesen. Für den Bereich Logistik spricht, dass die Rechnungsprüfung die qualitative und mengenmäßige Kontrolle durchführt. Die Logistik verfolgt unter anderem das Ziel, die richtige Ware in der richtigen Menge und Qualität zur richtigen Zeit zum Empfänger zu transportieren. Das Rechnungswesen beansprucht oft die Verantwortung für die Überprüfung von Kontierungen und Zahlungsbedingungen. Das Rechnungswesen hat unter anderem das Ziel, eine ordnungsgemäße Bilanz und Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung aufzustellen. Wird der Prozess gesplittet, beispielsweise in der Art, dass zunächst die qualitative und Mengenkontrolle in der Logistik durchgeführt wird und später nach Weitergabe der Dokumente die kaufmännische bzw. finanztechnische Prüfung im Rechnungswesen erfolgt, sind fast zwangsläufig durch den Bearbeiterwechsel Verzögerungen zu erwarten."

Die meisten heutigen Computer verwenden diese Architektur und bestehen aus (Leimeister 2021, 43):\n\neinem Zentralprozessor (CPU = Central Processing Unit), der die Befehle (Instruktionen) eines Programms einzeln nacheinander interpretiert und ausführt,\neinem Hauptspeicher, in dem zum Zeitpunkt der Verarbeitung das auszuführende Programm und die dafür benötigten Daten gespeichert sind, und\nden Datenwegen für den Datentransfer zwischen den Komponenten des Rechners und den peripheren Geräten\n\nFür eine detaillierte Beschreibung der Komponenten siehe Leimeister (2021)."

Heath and Heath (2011)\n\n\n\nSome of Heath and Heath (2011) recommendations to encourage habits:\n\nSet an action trigger: The power of action triggers is that decisions are “pre-loaded.” If you want to act in a new way, picture the exact time and situation when you will execute the plan.\nCan you piggyback a new habit on an old one? It’s easiest to start a new routine when you can build it on an existing routine that takes place at a specific time and place. If you often forget to take your vitamins in the morning, put the vitamin bottle on top of the toothpaste. You know you’ll remember to brush your teeth, so you can “piggyback” your vitamin intake with brushing your teeth. Similarly, it might be easier for hospitals to get doctors to wash their hands if they put sanitizer next to the trays from which they take a patient’s chart - squeeze and rub before taking the chart.\nCreate a checklist: Suppose you had a five-item checklist for the most important routines in your business. What 5 things do you need to do every time?\nStand up your meetings: “Stand-up meeting” are a way to keep discussions brief and focused. Given the way your meetings have evolved, what habits have you implicitly encouraged (whether good or bad)? Are there ways you could alter the format of your meetings—the routine—to make them more effective? If so, set an action trigger—I’m going to pilot this new “meeting style” next Thursday with the staff meeting.\nPublicize your action triggers: What is the aspect of your change efforts that people tend to put off, or that tends to get displaced in favor of more “urgent” work? Ask your team to set action triggers – and to announce their intentions publicly in a meeting."

Steve Cole, research director for HopeLabs\n\n\n\nHope labs developed a game called Re-Mission (Kato et al. 2008).\n\n\n\nThey played Roxxi, a nanorobot in a silver suit that moved through the bloodstream and bombarded tumor cells with electro-green chemo beams; in between, Smitty, a mentor robot, provided additional information about chemotherapy and recovery.\nKids adherence to their medication plans increased significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThings you see are more likely to evoke emotion than things you read.\n\nMake the need for change clear (tangible).\n\n\n\nBe cautious with negative emotions when people need to think flexibly or creatively. Negative emotions are effective to motivate people to tackle short-run challenges that require clear, forceful action.\nInspire positive emotion, e.g., by pointing to a bright spot.\nPositive emotions broaden and build our repertoire of thoughts and action and encourage us to play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera crew thought experiment.\n\n\n\nImagine that, in making the case for change to your people, you weren’t allowed to speak to them directly. Instead, you had a camera crew at your disposal who would film anything you wanted them to film, and you could pick any 10 minutes of footage that they shot. What would be happening in that footage?"

It’s easiest to start a new routine when you can build it on an existing routine that takes place at a specific time and place. If you often forget to take your vitamins in the morning, put the vitamin bottle on top of the toothpaste. You know you’ll remember to brush your teeth, so you can “piggyback” your vitamin intake with brushing your teeth. Similarly, it might be easier for hospitals to get doctors to wash their hands if they put sanitizer next to the trays from which they take a patient’s chart - squeeze and rub before taking the chart.\nCreate a checklist: Suppose you had a five-item checklist for the most important routines in your business. What 5 things do you need to do every time?\nStand up your meetings: “Stand-up meeting” are a way to keep discussions brief and focused. Given the way your meetings have evolved, what habits have you implicitly encouraged (whether good or bad)? Are there ways you could alter the format of your meetings—the routine—to make them more effective? If so, set an action trigger—I’m going to pilot this new “meeting style” next Thursday with the staff meeting.\nPublicize your action triggers: What is the aspect of your change efforts that people tend to put off, or that tends to get displaced in favor of more “urgent” work? Ask your team to set action triggers – and to announce their intentions publicly in a meeting."

You can do it if you really want (and tell yourself).\n\n\n\nMany studies offer evidence for a phenomenon called ego depletion—the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up (Baumeister and Tierney 2012). Some researchers also concluded that self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source (i.e., the fuel in our willpower tank).\nBelieving we do run out of willpower makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.\nHowever, only recently Job et al. (2013) concluded that only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. People how did not see willpower as a finite resource did not show signs of ego depletion.\nThere is also the viewpoint that willpower acts like an emotion. Just as we don’t “run dry” of joy or anger, willpower fluctuates depending on what is happening to us and how we are feeling. Eyal (2019, 51) does concludes that “if mental energy is more like an emotion than fuel in a tank, it can be managed and utilized as such”.\nWhat we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control (e.g., the cravings are stronger then my willpower) actually leads to less self-control.\nImplications:\nBelief in your willpower and practice self-compassion, because people how do not see their willpower as limited resource and are more self-compassionate are more resilient."

You can do it if you really want (and tell yourself).\n\n\n\nMany studies offer evidence for a phenomenon called ego depletion—the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up (Baumeister and Tierney 2012). Some researchers also concluded that self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source (i.e., the fuel in our willpower tank).\nBelieving we do run out of willpower makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.\nHowever, only recently Job et al. (2013) concluded that only people who view willpower as limited and easily depleted exhibited improved self-control after sugar consumption. People how did not see willpower as a finite resource did not show signs of ego depletion.\nThere is also the viewpoint that willpower acts like an emotion. Just as we don’t “run dry” of joy or anger, willpower fluctuates depending on what is happening to us and how we are feeling. Eyal (2019, 51) does concludes that “if mental energy is more like an emotion than fuel in a tank, it can be managed and utilized as such”.\nWhat we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control (e.g., the cravings are stronger then my willpower) actually leads to less self-control.\nImplications:\nBelief in your willpower and practice self-compassion, because people how do not see their willpower as limited resource and are more self-compassionate are more resilient."

Eyal (2019, 70)\n\nImplications:\n\nTimebox your day2. Plan time to live your values; plan time not only for work, but also for you (e.g., distraction) and your relationships.\nReflect and refine. Revisit and refine your schedule regularly, but stick to it once it’s set(Gollwitzer 1999).\n\n2 There are several tutorials available on how to use a calendaring tool for timeboxing, see e.g., (How to Block Time on Google Calendar)[https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/block-time-google-calendar/].Eyal (2019, 63–64) recommends to set aside fifteen minutes a week to revisit and refine your calendar by asking following questions:\n\nWhen in my schedule did I do what I said I would do and when did I get distracted?\nWhat strategies can I use to manage the trigger next time?\nAre there changes I can make to my calendar that will give me the time I need to better express my values?\n\nEyal (2019, 64) also advises creating a schedule as a curious scientist rather than a drill sergant. This gives the freedom to get better with each iteration."

Researchers explore the problem’s practical implications and motivations, ensuring that it aligns with the needs of practitioners or organizations.\nDefinition of objectives: Researchers define clear objectives for designing a solution to the identified problem. These objectives outline what the designed artifact aims to achieve and the benefits it should provide.\nDesign and development: In this phase, researchers design and develop the innovative artifact as a solution to the problem. This involves creating a detailed design, building the artifact, and ensuring it aligns with the defined objectives.\nDemonstration: The developed artifact is demonstrated to stakeholders, practitioners, or experts to showcase its functionality and potential benefits. Feedback is gathered to assess the artifact’s initial usability and feasibility.\nEvaluation: The artifact’s effectiveness, efficiency, and utility are rigorously evaluated using appropriate evaluation methods. This phase aims to determine the artifact’s impact on solving the identified problem and whether it meets the defined objectives.\nCommunication: The final phase involves communicating the results of the design science research. Researchers document their findings, insights, and lessons learned. This documentation contributes to the body of knowledge in the field and helps practitioners understand and apply the developed artifact."

The paper consists of following parts:\n\n\nResearch problem, literature stream, literature synthesis, theory & method\n\n\n\n\nResearch problem (1 page)\n\nDescribe the research problem, enumerate why the problem is important from both a practical and scholarly standpoint, and specify the research objectives and question(s).\n\nLiterature stream (1-2 pages)\n\nWrite a short reflection on your own research topic in relation to IS and management research. In what tradition does it fit? Can you identify new literature to draw from? Can you think of other disciplines that might enrich theorizing in your own topic or field of study? If so, what would these be? Identify candidate scholarly journals that are likely to be suitable targets for the research and explain why these can be suitable outlets. Articles from these journals should serve as exemplars for the approach taken to develop your research.\n\nLiterature synthesis (2 pages)\n\nSynthesize the approx. 10-15 major articles that are relevant to the problem and research questions, clearly articulating what is known and the gaps in knowledge pertaining to the problem that motivate the research.\n\nTheory (3-5 pages)\n\nSpecify the role of existing theory for your research. What theory/theories will be used to inform the study? Why are they suitable? In addition, develop and outline the key elements of your theoretical model and their relationships. Ensure that there is correspondence between the theoretical arguments and the specification of the model.\n\nMethod (2-3 pages)\n\nWrite a short reflection on the effectiveness of different research methods (and their epistemological assumptions) that you could apply to achieve the research objectives.

    "text": "Types of sciences\n\n\n\nNatural sciences\nand social sciences\n\nWhat is the difference?\n\n\nThe distinction between natural and social is very important to understand because the inquiries or research processes for the two are very different.\nThe natural sciences are referred to as the “exact sciences” : these inquiries rely on precise and accurate measurements of phenomena or their properties. Examples of such work are readily found in any high school chemistry or physics department. In the natural science of physics, for example, properties such as the speed of light or gravity have been calculated and will remain invariant.\nThe social sciences are even further away from precision. In the social sciences, phenomena as well as measurements are often vague, imprecise, non-deterministic, and ambiguous. Think about a study that examines whether happy people sleep more or less than unhappy people. Problems abound when we try to understand let alone precisely measure what happiness means, or when we try to isolate the true cause of variation in sleep length. We all know that for any two given days people will not likely sleep for the same amount of time, and there are plenty of reasons for this variation: there could be noise in the bedroom, light shining through the window, more or less wind breezing through the room, the person could have eaten differently in turn affecting their sleep patterns, the person could have had a good dream or a nightmare, and so forth. Many reasons may contribute to different durations of sleep – and but one of them may be related to some form or other of happiness!\nOne of the many manifestations of this issue is the challenge of measurement error. Measurement error is invariably present in the social sciences. This issue recognizes that because of the complexity, vagueness, and ambiguity of many of the phenomena under study, many of which we cannot faithfully define or isolate precisely, there will always be imprecision in the way we study our phenomena of interest, and the findings we in turn obtain."

We all know that for any two given days people will not likely sleep for the same amount of time, and there are plenty of reasons for this variation: there could be noise in the bedroom, light shining through the window, more or less wind breezing through the room, the person could have eaten differently in turn affecting their sleep patterns, the person could have had a good dream or a nightmare, and so forth. Many reasons may contribute to different durations of sleep – and but one of them may be related to some form or other of happiness!\nOne of the many manifestations of this issue is the challenge of measurement error. Measurement error is invariably present in the social sciences. This issue recognizes that because of the complexity, vagueness, and ambiguity of many of the phenomena under study, many of which we cannot faithfully define or isolate precisely, there will always be imprecision in the way we study our phenomena of interest, and the findings we in turn obtain."

For instance, you should ask “How do musicians adapt their professional role identity in response to gnerative AI systems?” in contrast to “How do employees adapt their professional role identity in response to these AI systems?”\nFocus on process: The real strength of a qualitative approach is in understanding the process by which phenomena take place not determining wether a particular result is causally related to one or antother variable and to what extend these are related. Process questions focus on how and why things happen, rather than whether there is a particular difference or relationship or how much it is explained by other variables."

This model is widely used in qualitative research to manage and make sense of large amounts of qualitative data. The model emphasizes an iterative approach where researchers move back and forth between different stages to refine their understanding and develop insights. Here are the key components of the model:\n\nData collection: The process begins with collecting qualitative data, such as interviews, observations, or documents. This data can be in the form of transcripts, field notes, or any other recorded material.\nData reduction: In this stage, researchers start the process of data analysis by reducing the volume of raw data into meaningful and manageable units. This involves coding, categorizing, and organizing the data to identify themes, patterns, and relationships.\nData display: After data reduction, researchers create visual representations of the data, such as matrices, charts, diagrams, or summaries. Data display helps researchers see the patterns and connections more clearly and facilitates comparison and interpretation.\nConclusion drawing/verification: This stage involves drawing conclusions from the analyzed data. Researchers interpret the patterns and themes identified and develop insights, explanations, or theories. The conclusions drawn should be supported by the data and aligned with the research objectives.\n\nThe process is iterative, meaning that researchers continuously move back and forth between the different stages. As new insights emerge, researchers might return to data reduction, refine data displays, or modify conclusions.\nTechniques for drawing and verifying conclusions:\n\nVerification strategies that enhance the credibility of the findings. These strategies include member checking (feedback from participants), peer debriefing (input from colleagues), and triangulation (using multiple data sources or methods).\nPattern matching: a technique used to compare the emerging findings with existing theories, literature, or conceptual frameworks. Researchers assess how well the observed patterns align with or deviate from established concepts.\nComparison: Researchers compare data across different cases, contexts, or groups to identify similarities, differences, and variations. This helps in developing a nuanced understanding of the phenomena under investigation.\nReflexivity: Throughout the process, researchers engage in reflexivity by critically reflecting on their own assumptions, biases, and perspectives that might influence the analysis. This self-awareness contributes to the rigor of the study."

Coding allows researchers to transform raw data into a more manageable and structured form, facilitating the identification of meaningful insights and patterns within the data.\nThere are two main types of coding in qualitative research:\n\nOpen coding involves breaking down the data into smaller units and assigning initial codes to capture the most basic concepts, ideas, or incidents present in the data. It is a process of exploring and identifying potential themes without preconceived notions, allowing for the emergence of new insights.\nAxial coding involves analyzing the initial codes (result of open coding) and their relationships to identify broader themes and concepts. Researchers examine how codes relate to each other and form more abstract categories. This process involves connecting subcategories and exploring the relationships between them.\nSelective coding: This stage involves further refining and selecting the most relevant and central categories that capture the essence of the data. Researchers focus on integrating and refining the categories to create a coherent and meaningful framework that represents the main themes and patterns in the data.\n\nThe coding process can be done manually or using specialized software designed for qualitative data analysis. During coding, researchers often create a coding scheme or codebook that outlines the definitions and descriptions of each code. This ensures consistency and reliability in coding, especially when multiple researchers are involved."

For instance, you should ask “How do musicians adapt their professional role identity in response to gnerative AI systems?” in contrast to “How do employees adapt their professional role identity in response to these AI systems?”\nFocus on process: The real strength of a qualitative approach is in understanding the process by which phenomena take place not determining wether a particular result is causally related to one or antother variable and to what extend these are related.

This can help ensure that you capture specific aspects consistently across different data collection sessions.\nMaintain a field journal to record your reflections, thoughts, and observations as a researcher. Document your own emotions, biases, and insights that arise during the data collection process.\nInclude timestamps in your notes to track when specific events, comments, or interactions occurred. This is especially important for understanding the sequence of events.\nDocument the context in which data is collected. Include information about the setting, participants, your role as a researcher, and any relevant external factors.\nReview your notes or recordings after data collection to ensure accuracy. Clarify any unclear points or discrepancies.\nKeep a record of your own reflections on the data collection process, challenges faced, and any deviations from the original plan. This transparency adds to the trustworthiness of the study."

This model is widely used in qualitative research to manage and make sense of large amounts of qualitative data. The model emphasizes an iterative approach where researchers move back and forth between different stages to refine their understanding and develop insights. Here are the key components of the model:\n\nData collection: The process begins with collecting qualitative data, such as interviews, observations, or documents. This data can be in the form of transcripts, field notes, or any other recorded material.\nData reduction: In this stage, researchers start the process of data analysis by reducing the volume of raw data into meaningful and manageable units. This involves coding, categorizing, and organizing the data to identify themes, patterns, and relationships.\nData display: After data reduction, researchers create visual representations of the data, such as matrices, charts, diagrams, or summaries. Data display helps researchers see the patterns and connections more clearly and facilitates comparison and interpretation.\nConclusion drawing/verification: This stage involves drawing conclusions from the analyzed data. Researchers interpret the patterns and themes identified and develop insights, explanations, or theories. The conclusions drawn should be supported by the data and aligned with the research objectives.\n\nThe process is iterative, meaning that researchers continuously move back and forth between the different stages. As new insights emerge, researchers might return to data reduction, refine data displays, or modify conclusions.\nTechniques for drawing and verifying conclusions:\n\nVerification strategies that enhance the credibility of the findings. These strategies include member checking (feedback from participants), peer debriefing (input from colleagues), and triangulation (using multiple data sources or methods).\nPattern matching: a technique used to compare the emerging findings with existing theories, literature, or conceptual frameworks. Researchers assess how well the observed patterns align with or deviate from established concepts.\nComparison: Researchers compare data across different cases, contexts, or groups to identify similarities, differences, and variations. This helps in developing a nuanced understanding of the phenomena under investigation.\nReflexivity: Throughout the process, researchers engage in reflexivity by critically reflecting on their own assumptions, biases, and perspectives that might influence the analysis. This self-awareness contributes to the rigor of the study."

Coding allows researchers to transform raw data into a more manageable and structured form, facilitating the identification of meaningful insights and patterns within the data.\nThere are two main types of coding in qualitative research:\n\nOpen coding involves breaking down the data into smaller units and assigning initial codes to capture the most basic concepts, ideas, or incidents present in the data. It is a process of exploring and identifying potential themes without preconceived notions, allowing for the emergence of new insights.\nAxial coding involves analyzing the initial codes (result of open coding) and their relationships to identify broader themes and concepts. Researchers examine how codes relate to each other and form more abstract categories. This process involves connecting subcategories and exploring the relationships between them.\nSelective coding: This stage involves further refining and selecting the most relevant and central categories that capture the essence of the data. Researchers focus on integrating and refining the categories to create a coherent and meaningful framework that represents the main themes and patterns in the data.\n\nThe coding process can be done manually or using specialized software designed for qualitative data analysis. During coding, researchers often create a coding scheme or codebook that outlines the definitions and descriptions of each code. This ensures consistency and reliability in coding, especially when multiple researchers are involved."

They provide a solid foundation for scientific inquiry by guiding research design, measurement, analysis, and communication. They contribute to the reliability, validity, and credibility of scientific findings, fostering progress and innovation in the respective fields of study. Poor concept definitions can result in measurement problems, misinterpretations, and difficulties in replicating studies (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, and Podsakoff 2016).\n\nCumulative knowledge\n\nScience is built on the cumulative advancement of knowledge. Clear definitions ensure that the progress made in one study can be built upon by subsequent studies. Inaccurate or vague definitions can lead to confusion and contradictory findings, hindering the cumulative nature of scientific discovery.\n\nTheoretical development\n\nClear concept definitions are the foundation of theoretical development in any scientific discipline. Well-defined concepts provide a common language and framework for researchers to build and refine theories, leading to a more organized and systematic understanding of phenomena.\n\nEmpirical research\n\nIn empirical research, clear conceptual definitions are crucial for designing experiments, surveys, and other research methods. If concepts are not well-defined, researchers may struggle to accurately measure and assess them, leading to inconsistent or unreliable results.\n\nReplication and verification\n\nReplicating research is a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. Without clear concept definitions, replication becomes difficult or even impossible, as different researchers might interpret and operationalize concepts differently, undermining the validity of the findings.\n\nValidation and theory testing\n\nClear concepts are essential for testing and validating theories. Researchers can assess whether a concept behaves as expected based on its definition, allowing for the refinement and improvement of theoretical frameworks.\n\nCommunication and collaboration\n\nClear definitions facilitate effective communication among researchers. When concepts are defined precisely, there is less room for ambiguity or misunderstanding. Researchers can collaborate more efficiently, share insights, and contribute to the accumulation of knowledge.\n\nAcademic rigor\n\nPrecise and well-defined concepts demonstrate a commitment to academic rigor and intellectual honesty. Researchers who take the time to carefully define their concepts show their dedication to producing high-quality and reliable research.\n\nTheoretical and practical applications\n\nClear concepts enable the translation of scientific findings into practical applications. Whether in business, policy-making, or other fields, well-defined concepts ensure that research insights can be effectively applied to real-world situations."

Intelligence, for example, can hardly be measured with just one variable, since we understand this concept to include abilities such as abstract thinking, comprehension, communication, reasoning, learning, planning, problem solving, and others, including the emotional intelligence mentioned above. We refer to such constructs as multidimensional constructs because they have multiple underlying dimensions, all of which are relevant to our understanding and use of the construct and, consequently, all of which we need to measure separately through specific variables. The example of intelligence shows why there is the IQ score (intelligence quotient), which is the standardized result of a complex test that includes measurement variables to determine the intelligence level of individuals alongside a number of ability dimensions such as abstract thinking, communication, creativity, learning, memory, problem solving, reasoning, visual processing, and others.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Operationalization of concepts (based on Recker (2021, 26)"

    "text": "Theorizing approaches\n\n\nBuilding theory,\ntesting theory,\nand extending theory.\n\n\n\nTheory building\nBuilding theory involves the development of new theoretical frameworks or explanatory models to understand a phenomenon. This process often starts with empirical observations or data collection. Researchers use inductive or abductive approaches to identify patterns, relationships, and underlying mechanisms. They formulate conceptual frameworks that capture these patterns and explain the observed phenomenon. Building theory is particularly useful when there is a lack of established theoretical foundations for a specific area of study (Mueller and Urbach 2017).\nTheory testing\nTesting theory involves subjecting existing theoretical frameworks or models to empirical scrutiny to assess their validity and predictive power. Researchers use deductive testing to generate hypotheses based on established theories and then gather data to confirm or refute these hypotheses. Inductive testing, on the other hand, uses empirical observations to challenge or refine existing theories. The goal of testing theory is to assess whether a theory accurately represents the real-world phenomenon and whether its predictions hold up under empirical examination.\nTheory extending\nExtending theory refers to the process of enhancing or expanding existing theoretical frameworks to refine and broaden their applicability, accommodating new empirical findings and addressing limitations.\nResearchers can extend theory in several ways:\n\nConceptual extension: This involves introducing new concepts, dimensions, or variables to an existing theory, enriching its explanatory scope and relevance.\nTheoretical extension: Researchers extend theory by adding new relationships, mechanisms, or components to an existing framework. This expands the theory’s ability to explain complex phenomena.\nInterdisciplinary extension: Extending theory by integrating insights and concepts from other disciplines, bridging gaps and enriching the theoretical foundations.\n\n\n\nThese approaches are not mutually exclusive, and researchers often combine elements from multiple approaches depending on the research context.\n\n\nThe choice depends on the research question, available data, and the goals of the study."

They provide a solid foundation for scientific inquiry by guiding research design, measurement, analysis, and communication. They contribute to the reliability, validity, and credibility of scientific findings, fostering progress and innovation in the respective fields of study. Poor concept definitions can result in measurement problems, misinterpretations, and difficulties in replicating studies (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, and Podsakoff 2016).\n\nCumulative knowledge\n\nScience is built on the cumulative advancement of knowledge. Clear definitions ensure that the progress made in one study can be built upon by subsequent studies. Inaccurate or vague definitions can lead to confusion and contradictory findings, hindering the cumulative nature of scientific discovery.\n\nTheoretical development\n\nClear concept definitions are the foundation of theoretical development in any scientific discipline. Well-defined concepts provide a common language and framework for researchers to build and refine theories, leading to a more organized and systematic understanding of phenomena.\n\nEmpirical research\n\nIn empirical research, clear conceptual definitions are crucial for designing experiments, surveys, and other research methods. If concepts are not well-defined, researchers may struggle to accurately measure and assess them, leading to inconsistent or unreliable results.\n\nReplication and verification\n\nReplicating research is a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. Without clear concept definitions, replication becomes difficult or even impossible, as different researchers might interpret and operationalize concepts differently, undermining the validity of the findings.\n\nValidation and theory testing\n\nClear concepts are essential for testing and validating theories. Researchers can assess whether a concept behaves as expected based on its definition, allowing for the refinement and improvement of theoretical frameworks.\n\nCommunication and collaboration\n\nClear definitions facilitate effective communication among researchers. When concepts are defined precisely, there is less room for ambiguity or misunderstanding. Researchers can collaborate more efficiently, share insights, and contribute to the accumulation of knowledge.\n\nAcademic rigor\n\nPrecise and well-defined concepts demonstrate a commitment to academic rigor and intellectual honesty. Researchers who take the time to carefully define their concepts show their dedication to producing high-quality and reliable research.\n\nTheoretical and practical applications\n\nClear concepts enable the translation of scientific findings into practical applications.

Intelligence, for example, can hardly be measured with just one variable, since we understand this concept to include abilities such as abstract thinking, comprehension, communication, reasoning, learning, planning, problem solving, and others, including the emotional intelligence mentioned above. We refer to such constructs as multidimensional constructs because they have multiple underlying dimensions, all of which are relevant to our understanding and use of the construct and, consequently, all of which we need to measure separately through specific variables. The example of intelligence shows why there is the IQ score (intelligence quotient), which is the standardized result of a complex test that includes measurement variables to determine the intelligence level of individuals alongside a number of ability dimensions such as abstract thinking, communication, creativity, learning, memory, problem solving, reasoning, visual processing, and others.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Operationalization of concepts (based on Recker (2021, 26)"

A perspective is simply a way of looking at and understanding the world or social constructions within it. Different researchers, working within different perspectives, construct different theories about the nature of that world. Mid-range and low-level theories are often based on the principles underpinning these persepctives. Thus, if you understand the basic principles of high-level theories, you will find it easier to understand other types of theory."

It provides predictions and has testable propositions but does not have well developed justificatory causal explanations. Example: Moore’ Law.\n\nIV Explanation and prediction\n\nThe theory says what is, how, why, when, where, and what will be. It provides predictions and has both testable propositions and causal explanations. Example: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).\n\nV Design and action\n\nThe theory says how to do something.

This process often starts with empirical observations or data collection. Researchers use inductive or abductive approaches to identify patterns, relationships, and underlying mechanisms. They formulate conceptual frameworks that capture these patterns and explain the observed phenomenon. Building theory is particularly useful when there is a lack of established theoretical foundations for a specific area of study (Mueller and Urbach 2017).\n\n\nTheory testing\nTesting theory involves subjecting existing theoretical frameworks or models to empirical scrutiny to assess their validity and predictive power. Researchers use deductive testing to generate hypotheses based on established theories and then gather data to confirm or refute these hypotheses. Inductive testing, on the other hand, uses empirical observations to challenge or refine existing theories. The goal of testing theory is to assess whether a theory accurately represents the real-world phenomenon and whether its predictions hold up under empirical examination.\n\n\nTheory extending\nExtending theory refers to the process of enhancing or expanding existing theoretical frameworks to refine and broaden their applicability, accommodating new empirical findings and addressing limitations.\nResearchers can extend theory in several ways:\n\nConceptual extension: This involves introducing new concepts, dimensions, or variables to an existing theory, enriching its explanatory scope and relevance.\nTheoretical extension: Researchers extend theory by adding new relationships, mechanisms, or components to an existing framework. This expands the theory’s ability to explain complex phenomena.\nInterdisciplinary extension: Extending theory by integrating insights and concepts from other disciplines, bridging gaps and enriching the theoretical foundations.\n\n\n\nThese approaches are not mutually exclusive, and researchers often combine elements from multiple approaches depending on the research context.\nThe choice depends on the research question, available data, and the goals of the study."

You’re in class, and the guy next to you -who is obviously a football player -says an unbelievably dumb thing in class. Why?1\nInitial theory: Football players are dumb.\n\n1 The example draws from Lave and March (1993).\nTheories should be about classes of things, not the thing (more general)2.2 Theories that are too narrow and specific (i.e., low-level theories) are not very interesting, even if they are correct.\n\n\nNew theory: Athletes are dumb.\n\n\n\nTheories should be explanatory. Moreover, they should be free of circular arguments as circularity prevents theories from being falsifiable.\n\n\nDumbness cannot be directly observed or measured. The only way we can know if people are dumb is by what they say and do. So we say that they say dumb things because they say dumb things.\nNew theory: To be a good athlete requires lots of practice time; being smart in class also requires study time. Amount of time is limited, so practicing a sport means less studying which means being less smart in class.\n\n\nA good theory is general enough to generate implications for other groups of people and other contexts, all of which serve as potential tests of the theory (i.e., the theory is fertile).\n\n\nWe can shift the focus from an enduring property of a class of people (athletes) to a mechanism. This means that we can apply the same reasoning to other people and other situations.\nNew theory: There is limited time in a day, so when a person engages in a very time-consuming activity, such as athletics, it takes away from other very time-consuming activities, such as studying (Limited Time Theory).\n\n\n\nOften, we find that there are also other explanations:\n\n\nEveryone has a need to excel in one area. Achieving excellence in any one area is enough to satisfy this need. Football players satisfy their need for accomplishment through football, so they are not motivated to be smart in class (Excellence Theory).\nWe are jealous of others’ success. When we are jealous, we subconsciously lower our evaluation of that person’s performance in other areas. So we think football players ask dumb questions (Jealousy Theory).\n\n\nWe need to study different contexts to see how our theories explain observations.\n\n\nDepending on the context, each theory leads to other expectations, e.g.,\n\nFootball players ask dumb questions out of season?\nWill athletes who do not look like athletes ask dumb questions?\n\nThe expectations of our theory lead to hypotheses that can be tested by empirical research."

If major business, organizational or technology changes are in the offing, it should describe them, the expected impact and when they will happen.\nThe formal organization and resource structures plus reporting lines and the allocation of responsibility and authority for IS provision and associated decisions. This includes the roles of any steering, planning, review or other decision-making groups. The allocation of authority and responsibility indicates how much control is retained in the corporate body and how much is devolved into the business as well as between business managers and specialists.\nInvestment approval and prioritization policies and practices: the implementation of the strategies will require many separate decisions on a variety of types of investments to be made. Rules and practices must be defined – preferably aligned to the different segments of the application portfolio (strategic, key operational, etc.) – making it clear how investments should be appraised, balancing the need for financial justification and management judgement. They should state how the various expenses (including internal resource costs) and capital items (including technology depreciation) should be treated and how risks should be assessed. Policies and practices also need to define a mechanism aligned closely with the investment decision-making process, for priority setting and resource allocation to ensure that the best return is obtained from the resources available. Finally the strategy should state how the outcome of the investments and projects will be evaluated after completion.\nVendor or supplier policies: these should cover the relationship with specific vendors, or the parameters that must guide selection of technology suppliers and contracts with any service providers. They should also be clear as to when central approval is needed or where local decisions can be taken.\nHR policies, including development and education of both specialists and business users and the management of changes resulting from IS implementation. It is easy to jeopardize IS strategies due to mismanagement of the people issues – new job roles and skills required, reorganization, redeployment and even redundancy. Each project, in each area, with each new technology should not need separate ‘negotiation’ – progress will become erratic and slow and outcomes uncertain, causing the strategy to be continually disrupted.\nIT accounting policies: strategies can fail due to insensitive or inappropriate accounting policies for the costing of, or charging for, /IT resources and services. The objectives of policies such as ‘IT chargeback’ should be clearly stated and understood. While they initially appear to be management accounting systems for cost allocation, once implemented they become ‘transfer pricing’ mechanisms, which will influence how users make decisions."

However, there are a number of factors that can be considered critical to success:\n\n\nPeople, executive buy-in, holistic view and in-depth understanding, consistent objectives, and ability to implement.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the ‘best’ people available from the business and IS/IT unit (and, when necessary, external advisers) to provide knowledge of the industry, the business, the capabilities IS/IT can deliver and, above all, creative thinking, none of which can be derived from a methodology;\nGaining the enthusiasm, commitment and involvement of top management;\nGetting a thorough understanding of the internal and external business and IS/IT environments, the business situation, its culture and the imperatives driving the strategy;\nSetting objectives consistent with the organization’s experience and maturity and tailoring the approach accordingly, employing a mixture of analytical and creative techniques.\n\nIt should be remembered that having a good strategy is only a means to an end – its implementation is when the value of the strategy is actually realized. A key aspect of the formulation process is ensuring the organization is both willing and able to implement its chosen strategy. This will depend as much on how the strategy is derived, and who is involved, as the content of the strategy."

    "text": "Other deliverables\nSome common issues that will probably be addressed in the IS/IT management strategy pointed out by Peppard and Ward (2016):\n\n\nOrganization and resource structures, approval and prioritization, vendor or supplier policies, HR policies, and IT accounting policies.\n\n\n\n\nScope and rationale that provide the business and technology context and reasons for the policies and directives it covers and preferably describing a ‘vision’ of the role and contribution expected of the digital capability and its relationship with business development and operations. If major business, organizational or technology changes are in the offing, it should describe them, the expected impact and when they will happen.\nThe formal organization and resource structures plus reporting lines and the allocation of responsibility and authority for IS provision and associated decisions. This includes the roles of any steering, planning, review or other decision-making groups. The allocation of authority and responsibility indicates how much control is retained in the corporate body and how much is devolved into the business as well as between business managers and specialists.\nInvestment approval and prioritization policies and practices: the implementation of the strategies will require many separate decisions on a variety of types of investments to be made. Rules and practices must be defined – preferably aligned to the different segments of the application portfolio (strategic, key operational, etc.) – making it clear how investments should be appraised, balancing the need for financial justification and management judgement. They should state how the various expenses (including internal resource costs) and capital items (including technology depreciation) should be treated and how risks should be assessed. Policies and practices also need to define a mechanism aligned closely with the investment decision-making process, for priority setting and resource allocation to ensure that the best return is obtained from the resources available. Finally the strategy should state how the outcome of the investments and projects will be evaluated after completion.\nVendor or supplier policies: these should cover the relationship with specific vendors, or the parameters that must guide selection of technology suppliers and contracts with any service providers. They should also be clear as to when central approval is needed or where local decisions can be taken.\nHR policies, including development and education of both specialists and business users and the management of changes resulting from IS implementation. It is easy to jeopardize IS strategies due to mismanagement of the people issues – new job roles and skills required, reorganization, redeployment and even redundancy. Each project, in each area, with each new technology should not need separate ‘negotiation’ – progress will become erratic and slow and outcomes uncertain, causing the strategy to be continually disrupted.\nIT accounting policies: strategies can fail due to insensitive or inappropriate accounting policies for the costing of, or charging for, /IT resources and services. The objectives of policies such as ‘IT chargeback’ should be clearly stated and understood. While they initially appear to be management accounting systems for cost allocation, once implemented they become ‘transfer pricing’ mechanisms, which will influence how users make decisions."

    "text": "Critical success factors\nDeveloping an IS strategy is a major undertaking, and despite a plethora of so-called ‘methods’, planning tools and brigades of consultants, it is still more of an art than a science (Peppard and Ward 2016). However, there are a number of factors that can be considered critical to success:\n\n\nPeople, executive buy-in, holistic view and in-depth understanding, consistent objectives, and ability to implement.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the ‘best’ people available from the business and IS/IT unit (and, when necessary, external advisers) to provide knowledge of the industry, the business, the capabilities IS/IT can deliver and, above all, creative thinking, none of which can be derived from a methodology;\nGaining the enthusiasm, commitment and involvement of top management;\nGetting a thorough understanding of the internal and external business and IS/IT environments, the business situation, its culture and the imperatives driving the strategy;\nSetting objectives consistent with the organization’s experience and maturity and tailoring the approach accordingly, employing a mixture of analytical and creative techniques.\n\nIt should be remembered that having a good strategy is only a means to an end – its implementation is when the value of the strategy is actually realized. A key aspect of the formulation process is ensuring the organization is both willing and able to implement its chosen strategy. This will depend as much on how the strategy is derived, and who is involved, as the content of the strategy."

This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.\nSeizing: Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nReconfiguring: In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization’s structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation."

Over the years, Apple has demonstrated its ability to sense market changes, seize opportunities, and reconfigure its resources effectively, all of which are central elements of dynamic capabilities.\n\nSensing: Apple constantly monitors consumer trends, technological advancements, and shifts in the global market. They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.\nSeizing: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.\nReconfiguring: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple’s app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.\n\nApple’s success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. This adaptability and innovation have enabled Apple to consistently deliver products and services that resonate with consumers worldwide."

Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources.\n\n\n\nThe question of organization\nThe organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the four VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization to maximize its impact. In addition, resources often work best when they are integrated with other resources and capabilities within the organization (Barney 1995)?\nThus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities.\n\nA firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage arising from the value, rareness and imitability of its resources and capabilities.\nThe firm’s complementary resources – for example, its formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant/important for a firm to realize competitive advantage.\nTo create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation."

Even if a resource possesses the four VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization to maximize its impact. In addition, resources often work best when they are integrated with other resources and capabilities within the organization (Barney 1995)?\nThus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities.\n\nA firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage arising from the value, rareness and imitability of its resources and capabilities.\nThe firm’s complementary resources – for example, its formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant/important for a firm to realize competitive advantage.\nTo create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation."

Dynamic capabilities play a critical role in adapting and reconfiguring these resources over time to maintain their competitiveness.\nBy developing dynamic capabilities, organizations can better navigate change and respond effectively to new challenges. They are thus a source of sustainable competitive advantage, allowing firms to continuously renew and adapt their strategies. To cultivate dynamic capabilities, organizations must prioritize learning, adaptation, and the ongoing renewal of their strategic initiatives."

This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.\nSeizing: Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity. This requires the organization to be agile and responsive, ensuring that resources are allocated swiftly to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nReconfiguring: In dynamic environments, organizations must be able to adapt and reconfigure their internal resources, such as talent and technology. Dynamic capabilities often necessitate changes in the organization’s structure, processes, and systems to support strategic adaptation."

Over the years, Apple has demonstrated its ability to sense market changes, seize opportunities, and reconfigure its resources effectively, all of which are central elements of dynamic capabilities.\n\nSensing: Apple constantly monitors consumer trends, technological advancements, and shifts in the global market. They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.\nSeizing: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPhone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.\nReconfiguring: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple’s app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.\n\nApple’s success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. This adaptability and innovation have enabled Apple to consistently deliver products and services that resonate with consumers worldwide."

The purpose of performance control is to regulate the overall results of a given unit. Objectives, budgets, operating plans, and various other kinds of generalo standards are established for the unit, and its performance is later measured in terms of these standards and the results fed back up the hierarchy.\nAction planning specifies decision that call for specific actions—to market new products, build new factories, sell old machines. Some of the proposed actions may be taken within single units, but others can cut acrros unit boundaries. By its imposition of specific decisions, action planning turns out to be a less than pure form of standardizing outputs; more exactly, it falls between that and standardizing work processes.\nSo whereas performance control says, “Increase sales by 10 percent this year [in any way you care to]”, action planning says, “Do it by introducing blue widgets”.\nThe diagram in Figure 4 explains how performance control and action planning work. The arrows in the diagram go in both directions, showing that performance control can happen in two ways. The first way is top-down, where objectives set by top management become more detailed as they move down the hierarchy. The second way is bottom-up, where lower-level units set their own performance standards. These standards are then combined as they move up the hierarchy and eventually become overall objectives for the entire organization at the top level.\nIn real-world practice, the performance control system is likely to operate not just as a pure top-down or bottom-up process, but as a combination of both. Some performance standards are detailed by top management and trickle down the hierarchy, while others are proposed by employees and aggregate up. At each level, managers try to set standards for their teams, and employees may suggest less strict ones. Through this negotiation process, a mix of composite and detailed performance standards emerges at all levels of the organization.\nThe action planning system primarily follows a top-down approach. In theory, it starts with strategic planning, where the organization evaluates its strengths and weaknesses based on environmental trends. It then creates a comprehensive set of strategies for the future. These strategies are translated into programs, which involve specific capital projects (e.g., launching a new product line and constructing a new factory) or operating projects (i.e., projects where costs are not capitalized typically evolving around enhancing and streamlining existing operations such as developing a marketing campaign). These programs are further detailed and scheduled, eventually becoming specific operating specifications that prompt direct actions.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Four planning hierarchies according to Mintzberg (2000)"

This framework is particularly useful for monitoring and managing various aspects of performance in a visually intuitive manner.\nThe Balanced Scorecard is a strategic performance measurement framework that takes a balanced approach by considering multiple perspectives. It includes financial metrics along with customer satisfaction, internal processes, and learning and growth. This framework is valuable for aligning organizational activities with the overall strategy and ensuring a balanced assessment of performance.\nThe Performance Pyramid offers a hierarchical representation of performance metrics, starting from financial indicators at the top and extending to operational metrics at the base. This framework organizes metrics into different levels based on their strategic relevance and impact. It provides a structured approach to performance measurement with a clear linkage to strategic goals.\nThe Performance Prism is a holistic framework that goes beyond traditional measures by considering stakeholders and their interests. It incorporates key elements such as stakeholders, strategies, processes, capabilities, and stakeholder satisfaction. This framework is valuable for providing a broader perspective on performance and assessing the impact on various stakeholders.\n\nEach framework offers a unique perspective on performance measurement. A combination of these frameworks may provide a more comprehensive understanding of performance."

    "text": "Conclusions\n\n\nStrategies have a life cycle, which is coined by waves of change and continuity.\n\nThus, a strategy cannot be a fixed plan, or being updated at a predetermined time.\n\nOverall, the dichotomy between formulation (and strategy-maker) and implementation (and subordinates who implement) makes little sense (Mintzberg 1978).\n\n\n\nFollowing his theoretical and empirical observations, Mintzberg (1978) conclueds that\n\nstrategies have a life cycle spanning from its conception, elaboration, decay, and death; and\nthere are periodic waves of change and continuity within the life cycle.\n\nThus, the assumptions of planning theory that a strategy-maker “formulates” a strategy, while the subordinates implement are often proved false (Mintzberg 1978):\n\nThe formulator is fully informed\nThe environment is sufficiently stable, or at least predictable. Thus, there will be no need for reformulation during implementation.\n\nConsequently, a strategy cannot be a fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at a predetermined time solely at the will of management (e.g., as a result of strategy deviations). Similarly, contingency planning, a popular prescription in times of environmental turmoil, can be risky because plans can tend to come to fruition whether they are needed or not. And so sometimes it can also be risky to make strategy explicit, especially in an uncertain environment with a dominant organizational operating system tending towards stability (Mintzberg 1978).\nMintzberg (1978) instead highlights that strategy formation is not a one-size-fits-all process. Rather, it involves various approaches and patterns, including entrepreneurial, adaptive, planning, and logical incrementalism.\n\nEntrepreneurial approach: Strategy emerges from a single visionary leader.\nAdaptive approach: Strategies evolve incrementally in response to changing circumstances.\nPlanned approach: Formal strategic planning processes drive strategy formulation. Logical incrementalism: A blend of planning and adaptation, where strategies develop incrementally.\n\nConsequently, strategy formation is not limited to formal processes or boardroom decisions. Informal interactions, serendipity, and learning from experience play a significant role. Likewise, aligning organizational actions with formulated strategies can be complex and may require ongoing adjustment.\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived. They are open minded, sensitive to experience and learn about their organisations/industries through personal involvement."

Formulation and implementation merge into a fluid process of learning through which creativity evolves.\nThe craftsman has an intimate knowledge of his/her work, capabilities and markets. In considering future prospects, they draw upon their past experiences. This knowledge is ‘tacit’–they sense rather than analyse these things.\nSimilarly, effective corporate strategies also evolve through such a creative process. Strategists are craftsmen, who link corporate capabilities to future market opportunities. They use their past experiences, and bring to their work an equally intimate knowledge of the issues they deal with."

Only by coming to understand the patterns that form in their own behavior do they get to know their capabilities and their potential. Thus crafting stategy, like managing craft, requires a natural synthesis of future, present and past. Mintzberg (1987)\n\n\n\n\nStrategies are both plans for the future and patterns from the past.\nStrategies need not be deliberate—they can also emerge, more or less.\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways.\nStrategic reorientation happen in brief, quantum leaps.\nManaging strategy is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change.\n\n\n\n\nPlans for the future and patterns from the past\nThe term ‘strategy’ is used as much to explain past behavior (pattern in actions over time, or realized strategy) as to describe intended behavior (the plan). A plan need not necessarily produce a pattern. So too, a pattern need not result from a plan.\nStrategies need not be deliberate – they can also emerge, more or less\nThe interplay of strategy formulation and implementation\nA realized strategy can be the result of a deliberate process involving formulation followed by successful implementation. However, it can also emerge as an adaptive response to evolving circumstances.\nWhen planned intentions fall short of achieving desired outcomes, organizations may find themselves with unrealized strategies. This can be attributed to challenges in implementation, but it may also stem from the belief that strategies should be strictly planned rather than allowed to evolve gradually through an organization’s actions and experiences.\nThe synergy of thought and action\nSimilar to how skilled craftspeople seamlessly blend thought and action in their craft, organizations should not separate the aspects of ‘thinking’ and ‘doing’ in strategy.\nStrategy is deeply intertwined with the day-to-day operational details of running an organization. Effective strategy does not exist in isolation but is deeply embedded in the organizational context.\nBalancing control and adaptation\nPurely deliberate strategy formulation can limit an organization’s ability to learn and adapt once the strategy is set in stone. In contrast, emergent strategy allows for ongoing adaptation but may risk losing control.\nAchieving effective strategy making requires a balance between learning and responsiveness on one hand and maintaining a level of control on the other. Therefore, in practice, strategy making often blends deliberate and emergent strategies to strike this balance.\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways\nEffective strategies can take shape through a variety of unconventional and unexpected paths. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategy development.\nSurprising as it may seem, errors can transform into opportunities, limitations can ignite creativity, and even moments of boredom can lead to significant strategic change.\nEmpowering strategy development from the bottom up\nOften strategies originate at lower organizational levels, nurtured by individuals with both technical expertise and a deep understanding of the on-ground realities. With the right resources and a capacity for learning, these locally generated strategies evolve into collective and organizational approaches.\nThese grass-roots strategies are particularly prevalent in businesses that require a high degree of expertise and creative thinking. In these organizations, strategy development is not confined to boardrooms but is embraced at all levels. Technical experts who are intimately familiar with the business’s intricacies play a central role in shaping the strategies that drive success.\nStrategic reorientations happen in brief, quantum leaps\nStrategic reorientation often manifest as abrupt and significant transformations, challenging the traditional perspective that change in an organization should be continuous.\nWhile conventional wisdom suggests continuous adaptation, strategy inherently seeks to establish stability. Organisations pursue a given strategic orientation for most of the time, as they achieve success not by changing strategies, but by exploiting the ones they have. However, when that strategic orientation grows out of sync with its environment over time, revolutionary change must take place. The organisation quickly alters many of its established patterns, as it tries to leap/shift to a new position of stability.\nA crucial aspect of strategy-making is navigating the delicate equilibrium between preserving stability and responding to external changes.\nTo manage strategy, then, is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived. They are open minded, sensitive to experience and learn about their organisations/industries through personal involvement."

It’s crucial to spend time making the current strategy work effectively.\nInstead of fixating on change, it’s more important to know when change is necessary. An excessive focus on change can be counterproductive and disrupt the organization’s balance.\nDetect discontinuity\nMost changes are small and temporary, requiring no major strategic response. Significant environmental changes that demand attention are infrequent but can be identified.\nThe real challenge lies in spotting subtle, unexpected shifts that could threaten the organization’s future. This calls for foresight and active involvement to recognize these irregular changes.\nKnow the business\nStrategic thinking relies on a deep understanding of the business and the creativity to harness that knowledge. Those with this expertise often notice things others miss and seize emerging opportunities.\nManage patterns\nEffective strategy management hinges on the ability to identify emerging patterns and support their development. This might involve creating flexible structures, hiring innovative talent, defining overarching strategies, and observing evolving patterns.\nSome patterns may need careful monitoring until their impact becomes clearer, helping decide whether to make them part of the deliberate strategy.\nReconcile change and continuity\nManagers should aim to strike a balance between change and continuity. An excessive fixation on either can harm the organization in the long run.\nNew patterns should be held in check until the organization is prepared for a significant strategic shift. Moreover, understanding past experiences is essential for navigating the future effectively. Crafting strategy, much like managing a craft, involves synthesizing the past, present, and future."

However, it is hard to imagine actions without intention in any part of the organization. Thus, it can be assumed that a purely emergent strategy is as rare as a purely intentional strategy."

    "text": "Conclusions\n\n\nStrategies have a life cycle, which is coined by waves of change and continuity.\n\nThus, a strategy cannot be a fixed plan, or being updated at a predetermined time.\n\nOverall, the dichotomy between formulation (and strategy-maker) and implementation (and subordinates who implement) makes little sense (Mintzberg 1978).\n\n\n\nFollowing his theoretical and empirical observations, Mintzberg (1978) conclueds that\n\nstrategies have a life cycle spanning from its conception, elaboration, decay, and death; and\nthere are periodic waves of change and continuity within the life cycle.\n\nThus, the assumptions of planning theory that a strategy-maker “formulates” a strategy, while the subordinates implement are often proved false (Mintzberg 1978):\n\nThe formulator is fully informed\nThe environment is sufficiently stable, or at least predictable. Thus, there will be no need for reformulation during implementation.\n\nConsequently, a strategy cannot be a fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at a predetermined time solely at the will of management (e.g., as a result of strategy deviations). Similarly, contingency planning, a popular prescription in times of environmental turmoil, can be risky because plans can tend to come to fruition whether they are needed or not. And so sometimes it can also be risky to make strategy explicit, especially in an uncertain environment with a dominant organizational operating system tending towards stability (Mintzberg 1978).\nMintzberg (1978) instead highlights that strategy formation is not a one-size-fits-all process. Rather, it involves various approaches and patterns, including entrepreneurial, adaptive, planning, and logical incrementalism.\n\nEntrepreneurial approach: Strategy emerges from a single visionary leader.\nAdaptive approach: Strategies evolve incrementally in response to changing circumstances.\nPlanned approach: Formal strategic planning processes drive strategy formulation. Logical incrementalism: A blend of planning and adaptation, where strategies develop incrementally.\n\nConsequently, strategy formation is not limited to formal processes or boardroom decisions. Informal interactions, serendipity, and learning from experience play a significant role. Likewise, aligning organizational actions with formulated strategies can be complex and may require ongoing adjustment.\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived. They are open minded, sensitive to experience and learn about their organisations/industries through personal involvement."

Formulation and implementation merge into a fluid process of learning through which creativity evolves.\nThe craftsman has an intimate knowledge of his/her work, capabilities and markets. In considering future prospects, they draw upon their past experiences. This knowledge is ‘tacit’–they sense rather than analyse these things.\nSimilarly, effective corporate strategies also evolve through such a creative process. Strategists are craftsmen, who link corporate capabilities to future market opportunities. They use their past experiences, and bring to their work an equally intimate knowledge of the issues they deal with."

Only by coming to understand the patterns that form in their own behavior do they get to know their capabilities and their potential. Thus crafting stategy, like managing craft, requires a natural synthesis of future, present and past. Mintzberg (1987)\n\n\n\n\nStrategies are both plans for the future and patterns from the past.\nStrategies need not be deliberate—they can also emerge, more or less.\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways.\nStrategic reorientation happen in brief, quantum leaps.\nManaging strategy is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans for the future and patterns from the past\nThe term ‘strategy’ is used as much to explain past behavior (pattern in actions over time, or realized strategy) as to describe intended behavior (the plan). A plan need not necessarily produce a pattern. So too, a pattern need not result from a plan.\n\n\nStrategies need not be deliberate – they can also emerge, more or less\nThe interplay of strategy formulation and implementation\nA realized strategy can be the result of a deliberate process involving formulation followed by successful implementation. However, it can also emerge as an adaptive response to evolving circumstances.\nWhen planned intentions fall short of achieving desired outcomes, organizations may find themselves with unrealized strategies. This can be attributed to challenges in implementation, but it may also stem from the belief that strategies should be strictly planned rather than allowed to evolve gradually through an organization’s actions and experiences.\nThe synergy of thought and action\nSimilar to how skilled craftspeople seamlessly blend thought and action in their craft, organizations should not separate the aspects of ‘thinking’ and ‘doing’ in strategy.\nStrategy is deeply intertwined with the day-to-day operational details of running an organization. Effective strategy does not exist in isolation but is deeply embedded in the organizational context.\nBalancing control and adaptation\nPurely deliberate strategy formulation can limit an organization’s ability to learn and adapt once the strategy is set in stone. In contrast, emergent strategy allows for ongoing adaptation but may risk losing control.\nAchieving effective strategy making requires a balance between learning and responsiveness on one hand and maintaining a level of control on the other. Therefore, in practice, strategy making often blends deliberate and emergent strategies to strike this balance.\n\n\nEffective strategies develop in all kinds of strange ways\nEffective strategies can take shape through a variety of unconventional and unexpected paths. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategy development.\nSurprising as it may seem, errors can transform into opportunities, limitations can ignite creativity, and even moments of boredom can lead to significant strategic change.\nEmpowering strategy development from the bottom up\nOften strategies originate at lower organizational levels, nurtured by individuals with both technical expertise and a deep understanding of the on-ground realities. With the right resources and a capacity for learning, these locally generated strategies evolve into collective and organizational approaches.\nThese grass-roots strategies are particularly prevalent in businesses that require a high degree of expertise and creative thinking. In these organizations, strategy development is not confined to boardrooms but is embraced at all levels. Technical experts who are intimately familiar with the business’s intricacies play a central role in shaping the strategies that drive success.\n\n\nStrategic reorientations happen in brief, quantum leaps\nStrategic reorientation often manifest as abrupt and significant transformations, challenging the traditional perspective that change in an organization should be continuous.\nWhile conventional wisdom suggests continuous adaptation, strategy inherently seeks to establish stability. Organisations pursue a given strategic orientation for most of the time, as they achieve success not by changing strategies, but by exploiting the ones they have. However, when that strategic orientation grows out of sync with its environment over time, revolutionary change must take place. The organisation quickly alters many of its established patterns, as it tries to leap/shift to a new position of stability.\nA crucial aspect of strategy-making is navigating the delicate equilibrium between preserving stability and responding to external changes.\n\n\nTo manage strategy, then, is to craft thought and action, control and learning, stability and change\nStrategists are not only planners or visionaries; they are also learners and pattern recognisers. They manage a process in which strategies/visions can emerge as well as be deliberately conceived.

It’s crucial to spend time making the current strategy work effectively.\nInstead of fixating on change, it’s more important to know when change is necessary. An excessive focus on change can be counterproductive and disrupt the organization’s balance.\n\n\nDetect discontinuity\nMost changes are small and temporary, requiring no major strategic response. Significant environmental changes that demand attention are infrequent but can be identified.\nThe real challenge lies in spotting subtle, unexpected shifts that could threaten the organization’s future. This calls for foresight and active involvement to recognize these irregular changes.\n\n\nKnow the business\nStrategic thinking relies on a deep understanding of the business and the creativity to harness that knowledge. Those with this expertise often notice things others miss and seize emerging opportunities.\n\n\nManage patterns\nEffective strategy management hinges on the ability to identify emerging patterns and support their development. This might involve creating flexible structures, hiring innovative talent, defining overarching strategies, and observing evolving patterns.\nSome patterns may need careful monitoring until their impact becomes clearer, helping decide whether to make them part of the deliberate strategy.\n\n\nReconcile change and continuity\nManagers should aim to strike a balance between change and continuity. An excessive fixation on either can harm the organization in the long run.\nNew patterns should be held in check until the organization is prepared for a significant strategic shift. Moreover, understanding past experiences is essential for navigating the future effectively. Crafting strategy, much like managing a craft, involves synthesizing the past, present, and future."

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn a functional structure is an organizational design that groups employees based on their specialized functions or roles within the organization. In a functional structure, employees with similar skills and expertise are organized into functional departments or units, each focused on a specific aspect of the organization’s operations. This structure is common in many types of organizations and is often characterized by clear lines of authority and reporting (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Functional structure based on Dess et al.

Each functional department is headed by a manager or director reporting to top leadership.\nSpecialization and expertise: Allows for a high level of specialization and expertise within each functional area. Employees focus on tasks related to their specific functions, leading to efficiency and depth of knowledge.\nCentralized decision-making: Decision-making authority is often centralized at the top of the hierarchy, with top-level executives making key strategic decisions that affect the entire organization.\nEfficient use of resources: Resources, such as personnel and equipment, are efficiently allocated within each functional department. This specialization can lead to economies of scale and resource optimization.\nClarity of roles: Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined within each functional department, contributing to role clarity and well-defined job descriptions.\nCommunication within functions: Communication predominantly occurs vertically within each functional department. Employees within the same function share a common language and understanding of their specific area of expertise.\n\nFunctional structures are well-suited for organizations with a relatively simple product or service line, where efficiency, expertise, and clear specialization are essential. However, they may face challenges when it comes to interdepartmental coordination and communication, especially in dynamic environments where cross-functional collaboration is crucial. Organizations may also adopt additional structures, such as matrix structures or divisional structures, to address the limitations of a purely functional approach in more complex or diversified settings."

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA divisional structure in organizational terms refers to a design that organizes an enterprise into semi-autonomous units or divisions, each responsible for a distinct product, service, or customer group. Each division within the structure operates as a separate business entity with its own functional areas, such as marketing, finance, and operations, though some functional are performed in each separate division and centrally (e.g., finance). The divisions are organized by product or service, customer-types, or process (i.e., strategic business units). This structure is often adopted by large organizations with diverse product lines or those operating in multiple markets (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Divisional structure based on Dess et al.

This enables divisions to adapt and respond more efficiently to the requirements of their particular markets.\nProfit and loss accountability: Divisions are often held accountable for their own financial performance. This accountability is reflected in their profit and loss statements, making divisions responsible for their own costs, revenues, and profitability.\nCoordination at the corporate level: While divisions operate independently, there is usually coordination at the corporate level. Corporate headquarters may provide support functions that serve all divisions, such as human resources, legal, and overall strategic planning.\nStrategic flexibility: The divisional structure offers strategic flexibility, allowing each division to tailor its strategies to the specific demands of its market or product category. This adaptability can enhance responsiveness to changes in the business environment.\nClear accountability: The structure provides clear lines of accountability, making it easier to assess the performance of each division individually. This clarity helps in making informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic adjustments.\n\nThe divisional structure is particularly suitable for large and complex organizations with diverse business interests. It allows for specialization and focused management attention in each division, fostering agility and responsiveness to market variations. However, it also requires effective coordination and communication between the corporate center and the individual divisions to ensure alignment with overall organizational objectives."

The model can be used to help identify what needs to be realigned to improve performance, or to maintain alignment during phases of change (e.g., restructuring, new processes, organizational merger, new systems, change of leadership).\nThe elements are (Channon and Caldart 2015):\n\nStrategy: Strategy is defined as the set of actions that a firm plans in response or anticipation of changes to its external environment. These actions allow a firm to improve its competitive positioning. Purpose of the business and the way the organization seeks to enhance its competitive advantage.\nStructure: Structure allow the firm to focus on areas that are deemed important for its evolution. This includes division of activities; integration and coordination mechanisms.\nSystems: These include formal and informal procedures for measurement, reward and resource allocation.\nShared values: These values define the firm’s key beliefs and aspirations that form the core of its corporate culture.\nSkills: The organization’s core competencies and distinctive capabilities. It is argued that old skills can often act as hindrance in developing new skills.\nStaff: Staff considers people as a pool of resources, which need to be nurtured, developed, guarded, and allocated. It includes organization’s human resources, demographic, educational and attitudinal characteristics.\nStyle: Typical behavior patterns of key groups, such as CEOs, managers, and other professionals."

Leaders can directly supervise and interact with employees, fostering close relationships.\nLow specialization: Job roles and tasks are not highly specialized. Employees often wear multiple hats and perform a variety of functions.\nQuick response to changes: The simplicity of the structure allows for quick adaptation to changes in the environment or market conditions.\n\nWhile a simple structure has its advantages, such as flexibility and quick decision-making, it may face challenges as the organization grows. As the organization expands, there is often a need for more formalization, departmentalization, and delegation of authority. This evolution may lead to the adoption of more complex organizational structures, such as functional structures or divisional structures, to accommodate the increased size and complexity of the organization."

    "text": "Functional structure\n\n\n\n\nFunctional structure based on Dess et al. (2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn a functional structure is an organizational design that groups employees based on their specialized functions or roles within the organization. In a functional structure, employees with similar skills and expertise are organized into functional departments or units, each focused on a specific aspect of the organization’s operations. This structure is common in many types of organizations and is often characterized by clear lines of authority and reporting (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Functional structure based on Dess et al. (2014)\n\n\nKey features of a functional structure include:\n\nClear hierarchy: The structure typically follows a clear hierarchical framework with a top-down chain of command. Each functional department is headed by a manager or director reporting to top leadership.\nSpecialization and expertise: Allows for a high level of specialization and expertise within each functional area. Employees focus on tasks related to their specific functions, leading to efficiency and depth of knowledge.\nCentralized decision-making: Decision-making authority is often centralized at the top of the hierarchy, with top-level executives making key strategic decisions that affect the entire organization.\nEfficient use of resources: Resources, such as personnel and equipment, are efficiently allocated within each functional department. This specialization can lead to economies of scale and resource optimization.\nClarity of roles: Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined within each functional department, contributing to role clarity and well-defined job descriptions.\nCommunication within functions: Communication predominantly occurs vertically within each functional department. Employees within the same function share a common language and understanding of their specific area of expertise.\n\nFunctional structures are well-suited for organizations with a relatively simple product or service line, where efficiency, expertise, and clear specialization are essential. However, they may face challenges when it comes to interdepartmental coordination and communication, especially in dynamic environments where cross-functional collaboration is crucial. Organizations may also adopt additional structures, such as matrix structures or divisional structures, to address the limitations of a purely functional approach in more complex or diversified settings."

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA divisional structure in organizational terms refers to a design that organizes an enterprise into semi-autonomous units or divisions, each responsible for a distinct product, service, or customer group. Each division within the structure operates as a separate business entity with its own functional areas, such as marketing, finance, and operations, though some functional are performed in each separate division and centrally (e.g., finance). The divisions are organized by product or service, customer-types, or process (i.e., strategic business units). This structure is often adopted by large organizations with diverse product lines or those operating in multiple markets (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Divisional structure based on Dess et al. (2014)\n\n\nKey features of a divisional structure include:\n\nDivisional autonomy: Divisions operate with a significant degree of autonomy. They have their own leadership, decision-making processes, and strategic initiatives.\nProduct, market, or geographic focus: This allows for specialization and focused attention on the unique needs of each market or product line.\nFunctional independence: Each division has its own set of functional areas (e.g., marketing, finance, operations) to support its specific activities. This enables divisions to adapt and respond more efficiently to the requirements of their particular markets.\nProfit and loss accountability: Divisions are often held accountable for their own financial performance. This accountability is reflected in their profit and loss statements, making divisions responsible for their own costs, revenues, and profitability.\nCoordination at the corporate level: While divisions operate independently, there is usually coordination at the corporate level. Corporate headquarters may provide support functions that serve all divisions, such as human resources, legal, and overall strategic planning.\nStrategic flexibility: The divisional structure offers strategic flexibility, allowing each division to tailor its strategies to the specific demands of its market or product category. This adaptability can enhance responsiveness to changes in the business environment.\nClear accountability: The structure provides clear lines of accountability, making it easier to assess the performance of each division individually. This clarity helps in making informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic adjustments.\n\nThe divisional structure is particularly suitable for large and complex organizations with diverse business interests. It allows for specialization and focused management attention in each division, fostering agility and responsiveness to market variations. However, it also requires effective coordination and communication between the corporate center and the individual divisions to ensure alignment with overall organizational objectives."

It is similar to a divisional structure, where the divisions are structured by geographical aspects. This structure is particularly relevant for companies that operate in multiple countries or regions. The international structure is crafted to address the complexities and challenges associated with managing operations across different geographic locations, each with its own cultural, legal, and economic characteristics.\nThe adoption of an international structure is often driven by a company’s expansion into global markets. As organizations grow and seek opportunities beyond their home country, the need for a structure that accommodates and leverages the diversity of international markets becomes imperative.

(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA matrix structure in organizational terms is a hybrid organizational design that combines elements of both functional and divisional structures. In a matrix structure, employees have dual reporting relationships - they report both to a functional manager and to a product, project, or geographic manager. This structure is particularly useful for organizations dealing with complex projects, multiple products, or a combination of functional and divisional demands (Dess et al. 2014; David and David 2016).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Matrix structure based on Dess et al. (2014)\n\n\nKey features of a matrix structure include:\n\nDual reporting relationships: Employees report to both a functional manager (based on their area of expertise, such as marketing or finance) and a project or divisional manager (based on the specific project, product, or geographic area they are working on). Functional and Divisional Dimensions:\nCombines the functional dimension (grouping by skills or expertise) with the divisional dimension (grouping by product, project, or geographic area). This allows for flexibility in addressing both functional and divisional needs.\nEnhanced communication and coordination: Facilitates improved communication and coordination between different parts of the organization, as individuals from various functional areas collaborate on specific projects or products.\nProject-based teams: Often involves the creation of project-based or cross-functional teams where individuals from different functional areas work together on specific tasks or projects.\nFlexibility and responsiveness: Offers greater flexibility and responsiveness to changes in the external environment, as the organization can quickly adapt to new projects, market demands, or technological advancements.\nResource efficiency: Allows for efficient use of resources, as individuals with specific expertise can be allocated to projects or products as needed without being limited by the boundaries of a traditional functional structure.\nComplex decision-making: Involves more complex decision-making processes, as employees may need to navigate and balance the expectations and priorities of both their functional and divisional managers.\n\nWhile the matrix structure offers advantages in terms of flexibility and responsiveness, it can also pose challenges related to potential conflicts, power struggles, and the complexity of reporting relationships. Effective communication, collaboration, and a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities are crucial for the success of a matrix structure. The matrix structure is often adopted in industries such as information technology, aerospace, or complex project-based organizations where interdisciplinary collaboration is essential."
