To identify a company’s distinctive competencies, resources and capabilities must be evaluated by considering four important questions:\n\nThe question of value.\nThe question of rareness.\nThe question of imitability.\nThe question of organisation.\n\n\nThe question of value\nResources must provide value to the organization and enable it to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. They should contribute to the firm’s ability to create or deliver products/services, reduce costs, or increase revenues (Barney 1995).\nManagers need to check if the firm’s resources and capabilities enable it to exploit opportunities and/or neutralize threats.\n\nManagers should be able to evaluate/distinguish resources and capabilities.\nManagers should identify resources and capabilities that add value from those that do not.\nManagers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that may be less valuable in the future due to changes in environmental factors.\nManagers should be able to identify resources and capabilities that are valuable because they can be applied in new ways.\n\n\n\nThe question of rareness\nResources should be rare or uncommon in the industry or among competitors. If a resource is widely available or easily replicable, it is less likely to provide a competitive advantage (Barney 1995).\nTherefore, managers need to assess the resources and capabilities that are considered valuable based on how many competing companies already have them.\n\nIf a valuable resource or capability is controlled by several competing firms, i.e. it is valuable but common, then it forms a source of competitive parity.\nResources or capabilities that are valuable and rare among competing firms, form sources of competitive advantage.\n\n\n\nThe question of imitability\nResources must be difficult for competitors to imitate or replicate. This can be due to factors like unique capabilities, proprietary knowledge, complex relationships, or a combination of elements that are hard to duplicate. In addition, there should be no readily available substitutes or alternatives for the resource. In other words, competitors cannot easily find a different resource to replace or replicate the unique value of the resource or capability (Barney 1995).\nThus, managers need to check if firms without a resource or capability identified as valuable and rare face a cost disadvantage in obtaining it, compared to firms that already possess it.\n\nIf a firm possesses valuable and rare resources or capabilities, it can gain at least a temporary competitive advantage.\n\nIf competing firms face a cost disadvantage in trying to imitate these resources/capabilities, then it leads to a sustained competitive advantage.\nImitation can occur through duplication or substitution. Socially complex resources are much more difficult to imitate than physically complex resources.\n\n\n\nThe question of organization\nThe organization and management of these resources play a crucial role in determining whether they can truly provide sustainable competitive advantages. Even if a resource possesses the four VRIN attributes, it must be strategically deployed within the organization to maximize its impact. In addition, resources often work best when they are integrated with other resources and capabilities within the organization (Barney 1995)?\nThus strategic management need to evaluate if a firm organised to exploit the full competitive potential of its resources and capabilities.\n\nA firm must be appropriately organised, in order to fully realise the potential for competitive advantage arising from the value, rareness and imitability of its resources and capabilities.\nThe firm’s complementary resources – for example, its formal reporting structure, management control systems or compensation policies – are relevant/important for a firm to realize competitive advantage.\nTo create sustained competitive advantage, managers must look inside their firms for valuable, rare and costly-to-imitate resources, and then exploit them through proper organisation."

This requires organizations to collect and analyze data from both external and internal sources.\nSeizing: Once an opportunity is identified, dynamic capabilities involve the rapid and efficient allocation of resources to exploit that opportunity.

They sense changes in customer preferences, such as the demand for smartphones, wearables, and digital services.\nSeizing: When Apple sensed the growing demand for smartphones, it seized the opportunity by launching the iPhone in 2007. The rapid development and launch a service ecosystem and new iPHone models showcase their ability to efficiently capture opportunities.\nReconfiguring: The shift from traditional Mac computers to mobile devices required significant reconfiguration of their manufacturing and supply chain processes. Apple’s app ecosystem and digital services are examples of reconfigured capabilities that add value to their products.\n\nApple’s success can be attributed in part to its dynamic capabilities, allowing the company to sense changes in the market, seize opportunities like the smartphone revolution, and reconfigure its resources and capabilities to maintain a competitive edge. This adaptability and innovation have enabled Apple to consistently deliver products and services that resonate with consumers worldwide."

The resource-based view emphasizes the significance of internal resources and capabilities in achieving competitive advantage. Dynamic capabilities represent an organization’s ability to adapt and reconfigure its resource base over time.\nWhen combined, these concepts offer a comprehensive framework for strategic management. By combining these perspectives, the Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) framework offers a starting point to develop and think through a strategy, particularly four types of strategies:\n\nSO strategies (strengths-opportunities): using a firm’s internal strengths to take advantage of external opportunities\nWO strategies (weaknesses-opportunities): improving internal weaknesses by taking advantage of external opportunities\nST strategies (strengths-threats): using a firm’s strengths to avoid or reduce the impact of external threats\nWT strategies (weaknesses-threats): defensive tactics directed at reducing internal weakness and avoiding external threats"
